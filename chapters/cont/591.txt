<title>591 Episode 8.Representative Kim Dokja (1)
My understanding of Yoo Joonghyuk has increased. It wasn't hard to find the reason.
Perhaps the comments left by kkoma Kim Dokjas had some kind of influence on me.
<&>「Is the 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk really a bad guy?」
The moment I heard those words, it was like hundreds of circuits in my head lit up at once.
<&>「"I lost a bad shield."」
<&>「"In the future, sea battles will be a bit difficult."」
In my head, the lines I had written for Yoo Joonghyuk popped up. In those lines, he was more of a villain than a good guy.
Moreover, Shin Yooseung from the 41st turn had also expressed her deep disappointment in Yoo Joonghyuk.
But what was the Yoo Joonghyuk I peeped at in the theater of my dream like?
<&>「"The marginalized group can come out in peace. I'll show you how to get food from now on."」
And what about the 40th turn Yoo Joonghyuk I saw through Anna Croft?
<&>「"If the world were to repeat itself once more, would you be willing to live a different life?"」
Can I really categorize Yoo Joonghyuk as a 'villain'?
In the slow-moving time of the Snowfield, I acknowledged that the words I read and wrote were only a part of the life Yoo Joonghyuk lived. This is especially true for the 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk.
There was only one sentence I could write about him now.
<&>「I don't know Yoo Joonghyuk.
<!>[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has increased slightly.]
<!>[You are now able to write about the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]
I checked the window in front of me, like checking the first footprints in the Snowfield.

# Protagonist's Choice
「At that moment, Yoo Joonghyuk ■■.......」
* At your current skill level, you can write a total of 20 additional characters.
+
Only 20 caracteres.
That was all I could write about 'Yoo Joonghyuk' at the moment.
<!>[Your understanding of the character is low.]
<!>[The number of times you can describe this scene is limited.]
<!>[You can only describe the scene once.]
I only got one chance.
I calmly closed my eyes and thought about the Yoo Joonghyuk I had seen with my own eyes.
The closest person to the current Yoo Joonghyuk was the Yoo Joonghyuk I saw in the 40th turn in the 'Phantom Prison', and the Yoo Joonghyuk who left two 'Elaine Forest Essence' beads at Geumho Station.
<!>[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has increased slightly.]
I thought.
<!>[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has increased slightly.]
I thought again.
20 characters. Barely enough to describe a single line of character behavior.
In those 20 characters, what can I express about Yoo Joonghyuk?
I often had this problem when I was writing Omniscient Reader. When I couldn't write the right line or action for a character.
<&>「"Just write it."」
At such times, Ji Eunyoo would say.
<&>「"Trust the characters who have lived in the world you created, and just write it."」
Once again, all I could do was helplessly believe her words.
<&>「Believe in Yoo Joonghyuk, who has lived in this world.」
I wrote a sentence for him.
It wasn't much, really.
But that one line was all I understood about him and all I could give him now.
<!>[This story is plausible.]
<!>[This story's reproduction success rate is 93%.]
<!>[There's enough probability.]
<!>[Do you want to check the reader's feedback?]
+
rlaehrwk37: Yoo Joonghyuk is Yoo Joonghyuk
+
I read that feedback wordlessly. I couldn't tell from the feedback whether this 'reproduction' would be successful or not.
All I can say now is that I'm on the same page as KimDokja37.
<!>[Successfully recreating the scene.]
<!>[Leaving the 'Snowfield'.]
The colorless time scattered. The guns of the mini-turrets were about to fire.
<&>「At that moment, Yoo Joonghyuk put down the spear.」
The faint spark in Yoo Joonghyuk's right hand was the effect of my sentence.
However, when he released the spear from his hand, he looked confused. He didn't understand why he suddenly did what he did.
From here, it was up to Yoo Joonghyuk
The Yoo Joonghyuk I saw. The unfortunate protagonist who wanted to save the world, even by joining hands with a villain.
<&>「In fact, Yoo Joonghyuk knew. He knew that he shouldn't kill Gong Pildu right now.」
<&>「Because this would be his last turn.」
"Die."
The mini-turrets that had finished charging spewed out fire. It was a shell that even the Steel Sword Lee Hyunsung had trouble blocking. Even if Yoo Joonghyuk was a monster who slaughtered a 7th grade monster species, there was no way he would be safe if he was hit by a series of turrets like that.
<&>「Seven turrets in total. If they all hit at the same time, even Yoo Joonghyuk will be in danger.」
But Yoo Joonghyuk didn't move. He didn't even hold his spear.
His expression was one of deep confusion. Maybe it was the sentence I wrote that shook his judgment.
But that was enough, Yoo Joonghyuk already did his part.
Then, this time,
<!>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.4' is activated!]
It was my turn to take responsibility for my words.
<&>「Turn into an 'Old Iron Shield'.」
At the same time as I used Incite, 'Thoughts of Almost Everything' glowed.
When Yoo Joonghyuk looked up, the shells were already in front of him.
Kwaaaaang!
I blocked Yoo Joonghyuk's way by a hair's breadth. The impact felt like it would shatter my shield.
But I held on.
I was able to hold on.
Because my strength level was now higher than Lee Hyunsung's.
"Yoo Joonghyuk. Wise decision. You must never kill Gong Pildu to achieve what you want."
When I glanced back, Yoo Joonghyuk was looking at me in surprise.
"Why are you looking at me like that? You said we'd be on the same side sometime."
I don't know what the 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk will go through in the future.
I don't know what tragedy he's been through, what despair he's been through, or how he's come to this conclusion.
But I can see it in his face now.
<&>「This world may not end in tragedy.」
I smirked at Yoo Joonghyuk, ending the conversation.
"I'll show you how I was able to make the Ten Evils my allies."

***

Kwaaaaang!
A distant bang. Watching Cheon Inho take the shells, the woman in the white coat frowned in the darkness.
She bit the lemon candy on her mouth and muttered.
"The more I look at him, the crazier he is."
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' chuckles.]
"What did he think he was doing, running right up to him? Did he forget that he's Cheon Inho?"
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' says that he misses it.]
The woman pursed her lips for a long time at those words, and then muttered through her teeth.
"......I don't miss him one bit."
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' says they never said they missed someone.]
"Shut up."

***

My sudden entry caused a lull in the station.
Luckily, Yoo Joonghyuk stepped back as if to observe.
In the distance, Lee Jihye and the others were looking at me with wide eyes.
I'm at my limit. Guys.
Of course, they weren't the only ones who were surprised.
"You...... What?"
Gong Pildu asked, and I replied.
"I'm Cheon Inho."
"Who wants to know your stupid name?"
The growling Gong Pildu showed signs of charging his mini-turret again, so I quickly added.
"If you don't mind, I'd like to have a word with the person behind you."
"What?"
At my words, the boy who had been hiding behind Gong Pildu's back poked his head out.
I waved to the boy who made eye contact.
"Hello?"
The boy quickly hid again.
An unfamiliar face.
In the entirety of Omniscient Reader, there had never been a boy like him by Gong Pildu's side.
<!>[Using 'Readers' Comments List' in this person.]
<!>[Checking the reader's profile information.]
Just by looking at it, I already knew what kind of person he would be.
Hmm, so he's like that.
While I was quickly checking the reader's information, Gong Pildu looked back at the boy and asked.
"Do you know him?"
The boy shook his head.
"Wait. Think again."
That's not good enough.
Fortunately, a wonderful reader of mine once told me how to deal with a situation like this.
"Aren't we 'between friends'?"
"Friends......?"
"Between friends."
Suddenly, the boy's expression changed.
Before I knew it, the rest of the party was standing next to me.
The boy looked back and forth between me and my group a few times, and his eyes widened when he realized that Jung Heewon was among us.
Slowly, the boy's small lips opened.
"9158......?"

***

A moment later, I was grabbed by the nape of my neck by Yoo Joonghyuk and dragged toward the railroad tracks.
I'm used to this by now.
In the distance, I could see the boy talking to my party.
A few steps away from him, Gong Pildu was staring at this side with disapproving eyes.
Yoo Joonghyuk looked at Gong Pildu and asked without even glancing at me.
"How did you convince him?"
"Because a villain knows best about villains."
"Cheon Inho......."
"I'm The One Who Deceived the Stars, and the Evil Sophist."
Yoo Joonghyuk looked back at me.
"What you need is not the human Cheon Inho, but the 'Ten Evil' that tormented you."
Yoo Joonghyuk suspects that I am not Cheon Inho. The best I can do now is to convince him of 'my' usefulness.
"How can I trust you?"
"Weren't you the one who trusted me and asked me to be on the same side?"
"Did you recover the memories of the previous turn? Looks like you managed to meet Anna Croft."
Fortunately, he seems to be able to communicate to some extent.
As expected, Kim Dokja was right. There is no such thing as a bad Yoo Joonghyuk in the world.
"But the situation has changed from the previous turn. It was a ridiculous idea to join hands with a Ten Evil after all."
There may be a liar Yoo Joonghyuk.
I quickly added before Yoo Joonghyuk could grab a spear and stab me.
"Don't think too much. This isn't the time to be picky with your colleagues. Are you thinking of hitting the reset button again?"
"You."
Unfortunately, I don't know everything that happened in the 40th turn. What I heard was only part of the conversation between Yoo Joonghyuk and Cheon Inho.
But for now, it's enough for me.
"Didn't you say yourself that this was the last time you could reset and that everything in the universe would be destroyed in this turn? Was it all a lie?"
Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes shook wildly.
"Honestly, you don't seem very desperate right now."
After a moment of silence, Yoo Joonghyuk stared into the darkness of the tunnel, as if there was a fierce enemy beyond it.
"I need a moment to think."
With that, Yoo Joonghyuk started to tap the railroad tracks with the tip of his spear and began to pace.
I left him alone with his thoughts and approached the others.
The boy from Chungmuro was already exchanging information with the others, especially Kyung Sein, which he seemed to be extremely close to.
"This is the 41st turn?"
"Yes, that's right."
"Oh my God. So that's why that Yoo Joonghyuk...... No wonder he was such a scum......."
I had a general idea of what they were talking about.
Apparently, the boy didn't know how many turns Yoo Joonghyuk had passed through.
The mumbling boy spotted me and jumped up from his seat.
Kyung Sein introduced the boy to me.
"Inho-ssi! This is the 7th Apostle from the Seven Apostles!"
The 7th Apostle.
Like Killer King, this boy was also a member of the Seven Apostles. If he was the 7th Apostle, he must be the last of the Apostles.
I extended my hand, and the boy nervously shook it.
"Oh, hello."
"Yes, it's nice to meet you."
"So this is what Cheon Inho looks like...... He's much more handsome than what I've read."
I grasped the boy's small hand and smiled bitterly.
It was the first compliment I heard since I possessed Cheon Inho.
"Thank you. Why don't we start by introducing ourselves? I'm Cheon Inho, as you know."
"I'm Ye Hyunwoo."
"That's your name, right?"
"Yes."
Ye Hyunwoo.
Listening to the name, I seemed to remember that there was a character with that name in Chungmuro's setting.
Ye Hyunwoo's sparkling eyes looked closely at my face, and then he asked.
"But how did you know I was an apostle?"
How did I know.

<?>[1] Princemaker77: It's originally in English.
I couldn't help but know.
Once I checked the platform, it was clear he wasn't an illegal reader, and more importantly, this boy had over 50 reads.
He's not like Killer King with 99.8 complete reads (almost 100 reads), but he's definitely like 0.5 of him.
So I thought.
Anyone who has read the novel this many times is 100% a member of 'that organization'.
"I recently met someone who seemed to have a similar vibe."
"Who?"
"Killer King."
"The 2nd Apostle? You're saying I'm like him?"
Ye Hyunwoo blushed as if he had heard something inaudible.
Seeing him like this, he was more likeable than that wannabe Yoo Joonghyuk.
"I actually heard from him. I heard there was a reader possessing a supporting villain. I guess it was Cheon Inho-ssi. Anyway, that bastard's always trying to be meaningful. Cheon Inho......."
"Killer King has been here?"
Ye Hyunwoo nodded.
"It's been a while. He even asked me to go with him, but I'm not the adventurous type."
Certainly, his choice to have Gong Pildu as his partner made that clear.
Safety first.
A wise choice in an apocalypse like this.
"By the way, thanks for stopping me earlier. If I had known that he was the 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk, I would have never fought him. Damn Killer King, he didn't even tell me that."
Killer King doesn't know that either. Reader-nim.
By the way, this reader is not very normal either.
Even if he didn't know it was the 41st turn, I can't believe someone who's read Omniscient Reader 50 times thought of fighting Yoo Joonghyuk.
"That part is a bit complicated."
Ye Hyunwoo said in a weak voice.
"I'm at the third stage of the tech tree² 「Plan to Raise an Invincible Castellan at Home」. I should have been able to cover Yoo Joonghyuk by now, according to my calculations......."
<?>[2] In strategy games, a technology, tech, or research tree is a hierarchical visual representation of the possible sequences of upgrades a player can unlock (most typically representing the research progress of a given faction). (From Wikipedia)
What...... Plan?
After letting out a deep sigh, Ye Hyunwoo said an unexpected name.
"Fuck, if Jiyoon was with me, I wouldn't have made this mistake."
