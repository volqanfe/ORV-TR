<title>800 Episode 38 Chance (6)
A splendid army of seraphs illuminated the darkness. The seraphs of <Eden>, each of which was as strong as a Historical-grade Constellation, and the Archangels of <Eden> who commanded them, revealed their outlines in the void.
As expected, most of them were Archangels I knew.
<!>[The Constellation 'Lily pin of Aquarius' looks at you.]
Archangel Gabriel.
<!>[The Constellation 'Guardian of Youth and Travel' looks at you.]
Archangel Raphael.
<!>[The Constellation 'Friend of Justice and Harmony' takes pity on you.]
<!>[The Constellation 'He who looks face to face with God' looks at you.]
Archangel Raguel and Camael.
<!>[The Constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is looking at you.]
Killer King's sponsor, Archangel Jophiel.
<!>[The Constellation 'Savior of the Fall' is looking at you.]
Even Michael, the strongest Archangel.
I calmed my pounding heart and checked the faces of the Archangels again and again.
Uriel is gone.
A belated worry came over me.
Maybe she had tried too hard to save me last time. Or maybe I had received some kind of threat from <Eden>.
<&>「Come to your senses.」
As if it was not the time to worry about Uriel, the Demon King of Salvation warned through the [Fourth Wall]. I swallowed and nodded.
The fact that I could endure facing such magnificent Archangels was all thanks to the naked (clothed) man blocking my way.
The Monarch Slayer Jaehwan.
I realized once again how great he was. Even if you search through the entire <Star Stream>, it would be difficult to find a Constellation that wouldn’t be intimidated by a single Giant Nebula.
Even that figure calmly reaching for the hilt of his sword as if such a threat was ridiculous…
"Wait a minute!"
"What is it?"
Jaehwan glared at me with a sharp gaze. I belatedly regretted it.
Now that I think about it, why did I do that?
Why did I stop Jaehwan?
"They might not have come to fight."
That’s right. That was my reason.
While I was with the 'Demon King of Salvation', I was chased by Giant Nebulas several times.
<Asgard> and <Olympus>. Or small Nebulas like <Gwiok>.
But I’ve never been chased by <Eden>.
"Let’s talk about it first."
"Why should I?"
By the way, Jaehwan, the 'Monarch Slayer', has another nickname, 'God Slayer'.
"There's no need to hurt someone who doesn't have any hostility."
"That guy Yoo Joonghyuk told me. He said that there are no harmless Constellations in the world."
Joonghyuk, what on earth did he say?
"No, Constellations aren’t generally harmful."
I don't know why I'm defending the Constellations.
But this was the only way to prevent a catastrophe. If there was Uriel among them that I hadn't discovered, it would be a big deal.
I took a deep breath and spoke in one breath.
"That's Yoo Joonghyuk's standard, and yours is different. Look at those fluttering pure white wings. Do they look like bad Constellations to you?"
Jaehwan glanced at the Archangels again at my words. Maybe the Monarch Slayer was a pretty sensible person.
At that moment, one of the Archangels who caught my eye stepped forward. He was the Archangel who shouldn't have stepped forward the most.
<@>[You are the 'Monarch Slayer'—]
I stepped in front of Jaehwan before Archangel Stab was activated.
"Over there! Wait a minute! Over there!"
<@>[...?]
"Savior of the Corrupted! Don't finish that sentence now!"
Michael glared at me as I stepped in front of Jaehwan and opened my mouth again.
<@>[What are you?]
Michael, the Savior of the Corrupted, is a Constellation of the Tale of the Fall. He's not even a simple Tale of the Fall, he's an Archangel who can reach the level of a Myth-grade when he activates 'Demon King'. There's probably only one incarnation in the entire <Star Stream> who can tease an Archangel like that.
"Me? I'm Kim Dokja."
Damn it, why am I Kim Dokja?
Michael, who had been glaring at me, asked back in a stupid voice.
<@>[So?]
"Let's all get along well."
An eerie silence swept over the surroundings. I heard Raphael's sighing voice, and I also saw Gabriel shaking his head with his hand on his head. Jophiel stared at me as if he was looking at a strange creature.
And then,
Kugugugugu!
Michael began to unleash his power without hesitation.
<!>[The Constellation 'Savior of the Fall' reveals his status.]
I hid behind Jaehwan again while watching Michael approaching step by step.
Honestly, why wouldn't I want to see it?
Michael vs. Jaehwan.
Savior of the Corrupted vs. Monarch Slayer.
Especially, if it was Michael and Jaehwan who activated 'Demon King', it would be a spectacle that I wouldn't be able to see even if I paid a thousand gold coins.
However, that's something 'rlaehrwk41' would think about, and it wasn't something I would be thinking about right now.
If a great clash of Myth-grade Constellations occurred right before my eyes, Yoo Joonghyuk and I would be swept away by the fierce waves of the stories and our limbs would be torn apart.
"Hey, Jaehwan-ssi. Actually, this is a bad guy. Could you kill just one of them?"
While Jaehwan was looking back at me as if he was dumbfounded, the other Archangels were approaching Michael.
I shouted in a hurry.
"Wait a minute! Stop! You know how scary this guy is!"
Thankfully, the Archangels had heard rumors of Jaehwan and were not acting rashly.
I quickly added.
"And this guy is not an evil person! He rejects evil and worships good! Isn't that the motto of your <Eden>? Never judge by appearances! He's even dressed so neatly!"
"You bastard."
I ignored Jaehwan's growling words and continued to shout.
"This person saved me and Yoo Joonghyuk. He saved us from the terrible Constellations of <Olympus> and <Asgard>— from the Gods of the Outer World!"
Jaehwan's sword, which was half-drawn, stopped for the first time. It felt like he was trying to hear what I was saying.
"This person also patted my back when I swallowed story fragments. It hurt so much that I could die, but I survived, so I guess I received the grace of life."
"..."
"Is that all? He stabbed and killed every Outer God who came near him for a whole ten days. Where else would you find someone who would show me such kindness while the Giant Nebulae were after me? Yes?"
When I came to my senses, I found myself repeating the argument of the 'Demon King of Salvation' like a parrot. But as I spoke, it seemed like he was right.
A murderer of Monarchs is not a villain. At least to me and Yoo Joonghyuk.
However, Archangel Jophiel seemed to have a slightly different opinion.
<@>[He is evil.]
An ominous light was flowing out of Jophiel’s eyes. His stigma, [Eye of Sin], had been activated.
When Jaehwan glared at him as if asking what was that, the light of [Eye of Sin] went out with a tsk-tsk sound. It seemed that an absolute being from another universe could extinguish a stigma just by glaring at it.
But even in that situation, Jophiel seemed to have witnessed something.
I struck first before he could open his mouth.
"Yes. Of course, it could be different depending on the perspective—"
<@>[He slaughtered over a million gods.]
I looked back at Jaehwan.
This kid is a villain, right?
But I pretended to be calm and responded.
"Couldn’t all the gods he killed be bad guys? He must have done it with good intentions. Right? He must have tried to make the world a better place—"
"My goal was to destroy the world."
"Yes, so to put it simply, in order to kill the evil gods and purify the world—"
"I killed them because they got in my way."
I wanted to tell him to shut up, but since ancient times, protagonists have never shut up when told to.
In the meantime, another protagonist who had come to his senses spoke to me.
—Kim Dokja.
Little Yoo Joonghyuk was getting up from the floating stone. He seemed to have figured out the general situation.
Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth to the Archangels, receiving my gaze that told him to stop them somehow.
"I want to kill them all."
Jaehwan nodded and muttered at Yoo Joonghyuk's words.
"There are times when we can see eye to eye."
The situation was becoming increasingly chaotic.
The moment I thought that this wouldn't be easy to solve even if the Demon King of Salvation came in person, Jaehwan's expression changed for the first time.
"This is fun."
The word 'fun' sounded different after meeting him.
I followed Jaehwan's gaze, hiding my ominous feelings. Then, the line of seraphs split, and an Archangel was seen walking from the back.
The Mythical Constellation of <Eden> was there.
The Ruler of the Archangels, and the second-in-command of <Eden>.
<!>[The Constellation 'Heavenly Scribe' is looking at you.]
Heavenly Scribe, Metatron.
Who would have thought I would see him here?
I bit my lips without realizing it. The fact that he was here  in person meant that <Eden> was serious about this situation.
<@>[It's nice to meet you.]
A uniquely polite and calm voice.
The first place his eyes turned to was little Yoo Joonghyuk.
<@>[The Puppet of the Oldest Dream.]
Then he looked at Jaehwan.
<@>[The Monarch Slayer.]
Finally, he stared at me.
<@>[And...]
He looked at me for a long time, then continued speaking with a faint sense of pride.
<@>[Little lamb. You're afraid.]
Of course. My sponsor would be scared if legions of Archangels came rushing in. What's more, if the opponent was 'Metatron', the master of strategy that even Kim Dokja would shiver with…
<@>[Don't worry. <Eden> and I will not harm you. We have no intention of changing the contents of the 'Revelation'.]
I immediately revised my evaluation of Metatron in my head.
What kind of place is <Eden>? It is a Nebula of angels. Angels are generally kind. If he is the representative of such angels, then he must be the kindest angel of all.
I briefly hoped that he might mediate all of this.
<@>[However, I cannot tolerate beings who break the balance of this world line.]
It was a vain hope.
The moment Metatron and Jaehwan's gazes crossed, Jaehwan pulled out his sword with a bitter smile.
"Your tongue is long. If you are going to attack, attack quickly."
The Archangels who were guarding Metatron quietly raised their voices at his arrogant tone.
Nevertheless, Jaehwan continued to speak as if provoking them.
“Do you think you can stop me with just a single person?”
The strength to fight a Giant Nebula alone.
Metatron acknowledged Jaehwan like that.
He nodded.
<@>[Absolute being of another world line. I know you are strong. If we were to eliminate you, we would not be safe either.]
"You will all die here."
Metatron shrugged lightly and smiled bitterly.
<@>[I guess you forgot that this is not your 'worldview'.]
That was when I felt an unusual magical power behind us. A being with the exact opposite attribute of the Archangels.
There were beings that should not be there.
<!>[The Demon King 'Lord of Hell' descends into the void!]
<!>[The Demon King 'Sonic Demon King' descends into the void!]
<!>[The Demon King 'Temptation and Barren Demon King' descends into the void!]
<!>[The Demon King 'Merciless Hunter of the Reverse Heaven' descends into the void!]
…
<!>[The Demon King 'Ruler of Eastern Hell' descends into the void!]
Demon Kings. It was unbelievable.
Why on earth did they show up here?
They wouldn't be trying to start a holy war here.
Hold on. Holy war?
"Run away. Right now."
Jaehwan glared at me as if I was talking nonsense.
"Are you talking about me just now?"
"That's right! Run away with me and Yoo Joonghyuk! Right now!"
I don't think Jaehwan will lose. Even if it's a Myth-grade Constellation, even if it's the famous <Eden>, it wouldn't be easy to deal with Jaehwan.
<&>「But if it's 'sealing' him, it might be a different story.」
Two pitch-black swirling spheres were placed in Metatron's hands. I already knew what those spheres were.
<@>[Get out of this story. Ghost of a ruined universe.]
That was a forbidden technique that Han Sooyoung once used to seal 'Yoo Joonghyuk of the 1,863rd Round.'
<!>[Mythical tale 'Seal of the Apocalypse' begins its storytelling!]
As long as this is the <Star Stream>, there is no one who can break that seal.
