<title>688 Episode 23 Fragments of God (3)
My open mouth could not be closed.
10 to 0?
Really? You won a 10-0 contract against that Bihyung?
When I looked up into the sky, I saw Bihyung sweating with a troubled expression on his face. It felt like he was having a conversation with someone, but it was obvious who it was.
—The conversation is over. Of course you know we are 10, right?
A hollow laugh came out.
Right.
Kim Dokja was this kind of person.
'What on earth have you done?'
He placed me in the center of the battlefield, opened the Seoul Broadcasting channel, renewed the <stream contract>, and invited constellations to this channel.
<!>[A significant number of constellations are watching your movements!]
<!>[300 coins were sponsored.]
All of this happened in less than 5 minutes.
—Are you ready?
I realize once again who I signed with.
He was once the swindler of this <Star Stream>.
The devil who mocked, despised, and saved the constellations.
"Yes."
I have 5 minutes left to live.
Again, I wasn't afraid.
Now I know why I am not afraid.
<!>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is with you.]
Perhaps I have been waiting for this moment all along.
—Let’s begin the return stage.
As I ran with all my might, my 70-strong strength condensed and my acceleration increased.
<!>[The story 'persistent martial arts master' begins its storytelling.]
As the story of the Ark was wrapped in my hands, my magic power, which had matured even further, drew blue in the air.
The monsters' heads were blown away like toys in a straight trajectory.
<!>[The constellation 'Goryeo’s First Sword' nods to your martial arts.]
Somehow, I felt like I was more accustomed to dealing with stories than before.
Is this also the influence of my sponsor?
Oooooh!
In the distance, an angry dragon howled and let out a bright red breath.
<!>[5th grade monster dragon species, 'Variant Imoogi Bracky' prepares 'breath'!]
It was a monster species that did not appear in the main story.
—It’s literally just an Imoogi. Strictly speaking, it's not a proper 'dragon'.
But I have Kim Dokja.
—The breath pattern is vertical. Looking at the pattern on its back, it appears to be a lower class of the Fire Dragon and Earth Dragon. Maybe there are rocks mixed in between the breaths?
<!>[5th grade monster dragon species 'Variant Imoogi Bracky' uses 'breath'!]
In fact, large chunks of hail were mixed in between the flying breaths.
While watching the flying fireball, Kim Dokja calmly continued his explanation.
—The flames are clustered around the boulder, so you only need to dodge the big ones. Open your eyes straight, have you ever played a rhythm game?
'I know what you want to say.'
—I think you're in the game now.
It was nonsense, but I actually did it.
I bent down just in time for the hailstones to fly in, and I swung my [Unbreakable Faith] to blow up the small lumps that I was unable to avoid. Even though the heat exploded right in front of me, I didn’t look away.
I thought I could do it.
—Okay, next!
The moment I kicked off the floor at the signal and flew up, my eyes met in the air with Jung Heewon’s, who was dodging the breath.
"Inho-ssi?"
Before Jung Heewon, who was surprised to see me, could shout out anything, I pointed behind her.
"Heewon-ssi! Behind you!"
The tail of the 4th grade dragon, who was looking for an opening, flew straight towards Jung Heewon. It was an attack with no apparent angle to avoid.
—Don't worry.
At the same time as Kim Dokja's words, a dazzling aura rose from Jung Heewon's whole body.
<!>[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' activates 'Judgment Time'!]
A super-powerful skill that demonstrates omnipotent combat power against monsters.
<!>[Judgment Time, which only the 'Judge of Destruction' can use, has demonstrated its supernormal ability.]
"Hold on tight!"
Jung Heewon, who snatched my hand, made abnormal movements in the air and fell to the ground.
As the monster's tail narrowly passed by, Jung Heewon sighed and shouted while holding onto my wrist.
"When did you wake up… No, rather, why did you come here! Do you know what the situation is now—"
"We’ll talk about that later. Heewon-ssi, if it were the current Heewon-ssi…"
I continued speaking as I caught a glimpse of the 4th grade dragon, who was glaring at us after retracting his tail.
"Can you deal with that guy?"
Even if Kim Dokja was with me, it was impossible to hunt a 4th grade monster with my current specs.
But for Jung Heewon, the story is different.
She is a specialist in hunting big monsters.
Now that [Judgment Time] has been activated, I might be able to fight against a 4th grade monster species.
"With that one thing, there’s no chance of winning."
"The other thing is the problem."
I said while looking at the 5th grade monster running towards me.
"I will deal with the 5th grade. Heewon-ssi, please hold back the 4th grade."
"Wait a minute, you’re so arrogant—"
"Heewon-ssi, you know very well what’s more important right now. If we don’t catch those monsters, everyone here will die."
At my words, Jung Heewon hurriedly looked behind her.
Sergeant Kim retreated to the rear with Jung Eunho on his back. Bang Cheolsoo’s group was also seen protecting him.
Jung Heewon, frowning, let go of my wrist and said.
"I’ll ask a lot of questions later."
She ran straight towards the 4th grade monster. An Earth Dragon also swung its huge front paws at her as if it had been waiting.
Immediately afterwards, a deafening roar erupted. If she were a normal incarnation, it would have been a blow that would have crushed her to the ground.
But Jung Heewon endured.
Oooooh!
Body specifications increased significantly while passing through the seventh scenario. Plus the buffs of [Judgment Time] and [demon slaying].
If she was like that now, she wouldn't be defeated even if her opponent was Yoo Jonghyuk of the 41st round.
I called out to Kim Dokja in my mind.
'Hey, Kim Dokja-ssi.'
I know it's a fight so exciting that he won't be able to take his eyes off it, but he still has to do what he has to do.
—Oh sorry. It reminds me of the old days.
Old days.
It wasn't that difficult to think of what Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation', might have thought while looking at Jung Heewon.
'But now I have just three minutes left to live.'
—Don't worry. You won't die here.
'Do you really have to speak so ominously?'
The 5th grade dragon species that had prepared its attack rushed towards me once again.
If it was 5th grade, it was a level that couldn’t have been killed even if the readers and I launched a joint attack 45 days ago.
I used the 'Labyrinth Watcher' to buy time, and I was able to hunt the monster only after Dansu ahjussi died once and I also risked my life.
Would I be able to kill such a monster alone?
—Strictly speaking, it’s not a major character. At least it can't use techniques like 'total annihilation'. That's because it only activates in disaster scenarios.
'Even if there's no such thing as annihilation, it doesn’t change that it’s strong.'
—You said your specs are enough for now? There's no time, so let's go quickly.
I nodded.
I had a clear idea in my head of what to do even if no one told me to.
—Sylphide's Leaping Boots.
<!>[The special option 'Leap' is activated.]
I soared up the body of the dragon in one go.
—Now.
When I activated the 'Blade of Faith' through 'Thoughts', the sword strike, which became even sharper due to the acceleration of [Leap], pierced the guy's spine.
The sensation of the blade entering was definitely different from the fourth scenario.
I guess it's because my physical stats have improved significantly.
Ahhh!
But this one blow wasn't enough to take him down.
A more certain shot was needed.
—Use [Incite] and [Sentence Enhancement].
A combination of [Sentence Enhancement] and [Incite] that reinforce behavior. It was one of my few talents that [incited] me to become a specific character and used that character's power.
'Can I use Yoo Jonghyuk?'
—How do you imitate Yoo Jonghyuk at your level now?
'There have been times when I did it.'
It was true.
It was short-lived and didn't go very well.
—The opponent is a monster species that evolved from an Imoogi. It’s obvious who to imitate, right?
'Ah.'
I nodded.
Now it’s the seventh scenario.
The number of stories I have is three.
Considering that one of them was 'semi-mythical', there was a character who I could have attempted to incite as even at my level.
Even more so if that guy's body is an Imoogi.
Ahhh!
The tip of its sharp claws scratched my thigh.
I suppressed the pain and activated [Sentence Enhancement].
<!>[The sub-skill 'Sentence Enhancement' is activated!]
<!>[You can enter your actions.]
<!>[The actions you enter will be reinforced.]
…
<!>[An error occurred!]
<!>[Currently you cannot activate 'Sentence Enhancement'!]
<!>[All probabilities needed to strengthen sentences have been exhausted!]
I belatedly remembered the last time I activated the skill.
At that time, I had wasted all probability in signing a contract with the 'Demon King of Salvation' to kill the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne'.
'I think I'm screwed.'
—It’s okay. You can at least use [Incite]!
'[Incite] cannot even imitate the character's skills.'
—It doesn’t matter, trust me! Hurry!
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.10' is activated!]
"I am-"
In my head, the pages of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint began to turn.
He is a being who can easily subdue the Imoogi in front of me.
The constellation that defeated Yamata no Orochi in the 'sixth scenario' in Peace Land.
"I am Kim Dokja, who defeated the 'Eight-Headed Snake' in 'Peace Land'!"
<!>['Incite' is pushed to its limit!]
With the activation of [Incite], strong faith surged deep into my cells.
“I am Kim Dokja. I am the same Kim Dokja who hunted Yamata no Orochi."
Then, the dragon species in front of me actually looked like nothing.
That's right, I hunted Yamata no Orochi.
What's so scary about that 5th grade?
I swung my sword at it with overflowing confidence.
I can win. I can kill—
Kagaga!
'Blade of Faith' was easily blocked.
The guy's huge maw opened before my eyes.
Quaaaaa!
I screamed as I hurriedly dodged the pouring breath.
If I had just been hit by that, I would have died.
I would’ve been really dead.
—Are you crazy? What if you run in there?
'No, you said to believe it!'
—There’s no way you can win with just [incite]! Give me 20,000 coins quickly.
'Yes—no, how much?'
Kim Dokja had no answer. And.
<!>[Sponsor contract provisions is activated!]
<!>[Your constellation is extorting a portion of the donation amount scheduled for you.]
<!>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' acquired 20,000 coins.]
No, this guy.
Kim Dokja opened his mouth as if satisfied.
—Good. Let's get started
Let’s go.
<!>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' uses 20,000 coins.]
At that moment, I realized what Kim Dokja was trying to do.
He has now paid the directing fee.
20,000 coins is the minimum probability to put my 'fake acting' on the 'real stage'.
<!>[The story 'The One who Hunted the King of Disasters' begins its storytelling.]
The One who Hunted the King of Disasters.
Kim Dokja's legendary story, a story obtained by cutting down Yamata no Orochi, who possesses the power of an Outer God.
That story was embedded in my whole body.
<!>[「Staging」 begins.]
The stage before my eyes began to change according to the influence of the story.
A part of Gwanghwamun's scenery was momentarily transformed into 'Veronica Castle', which was the stage of 'Peace Land'.
<!>[Currently, the reproduction level of 'Staging' is low.]
Although the level of reproduction was low because the opponent was not 'Yamata no Orochi', this was enough for now.
Grrrr—!
As evidence, the momentum of 5th grade dragon species had clearly changed. Unlike before, its eyes showed a strange sense of fear.
It was natural.
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is surprised by your story!]
This story is a story of the murder of the 'King of Imoogis'.
<!>[The constellations of the Balaur lineage are doubting the probability of the 'Demon King of Salvation'!]
<!>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire'’s eyes shine at your performance.]
I ran out as if I were Kim Dokja from 'Peace Land'.
A 5th grade dragon species opened its vicious maw as if it was about to bite me.
—Jump in!
With Kim Dokja's signal, I performed the mimicry of [Leap] and 'Thoughts' at the same time.
'Change into the Everchanging Stealth suit.'
<!>[The effect of the 'Everchanging Stealth Suit' is activated!]
Just like when I entered the 'Star Jewel Dungeon', I used the 'Everchanging Stealth Suit' to reduce the size of my body.
The moment the panicked monster dragon species opened its mouth, I burst into its mouth like a small shooting star. As soon as I passed through the uvula and into the esophagus, Kim Dokja gave a signal.
—Now.
I took off my stealth suit and put my hand into my chest. There was a real 'Unbreakable Faith' left behind by Han Sooyoung, who disappeared there.
'Help me, Han Sooyoung.'
I held the handle of the sword as if praying.
It's impossible on my own.
I also came here because of the story you wrote.
<!>[The story 'The One who Hunted the King of Disasters' roars!]
Shamelessly, I needed the power of that story one more time.
Giiiiiiing!
Light exploded from 'Unbreakable Faith' and a powerful 'Blade of Faith' emerged.
The characteristic of [Circulatory Retardation] was activated and magical power was released like a waterfall.
Stronger, faster.
<!>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' nods his head.]
I can't be Kim Dokja, who killed the King of Disasters—but if I have the qualifications to be 'Kim Dokja' at all.
If only I was still allowed that name.
<&>「At that moment, I will not doubt that I am Kim Dokja.」
The deep blue, white-blue magical power drew a dazzling trajectory.
