<title>672 Episode 21 Kim Dokja (8)
With the explosion, thick dust rose from the ground.
"Han Sooyoung!"
I ran to the center of Gwanghwamun where Han Sooyoung fell. No matter how many times I shouted, there was no answer from Han Sooyoung.
Coo coo coo coo.
The 'Absolute Throne' at the center of Gwanghwamun was rising into the air.
<#>【Ooooooooooooo.】
A faint cry was heard from far away.
It was undoubtedly a deity from another world.
Fortunately, the sound was too far away so I didn't vomit blood or faint, but the seriousness of the situation was clear.
<&>「This is something that did not happen in the previous 'Absolute Throne'’s scenario.」
The outer gods’ intervened.
Did Han Sooyoung fight something like that?
Why?
Hasn't she been trying to destroy this world?
"Han Sooyoung!"
I shouted once again, but Han Sooyoung was still nowhere to be seen. When the dust cleared, I saw the figure of Yoo Joonghyuk in the distance.
The guy was in a limp state, as if he had fainted.
"Yoo Joonghyuk!"
Yoo Joonghyuk's whole body was connected to a red thread extending from the 'Absolute Throne'.
The soaring Absolute Throne and the fallen Yoo Joonghyuk.
Very slowly, the distance between Yoo Joonghyuk and the throne was narrowing.
<!>[The 'Throne Succession Ceremony' begins.]
The series of constellations continued.
Founder of the Absolute Throne. It was the will of that outer god.
"Hey, look at that!"
"It’s Yoo Joonghyuk!"
The surrounding incarnations, who discovered the sight belatedly, shouted loudly.
<@>["Wow, things are getting fun. Then, we will come to the finale of this scenario."]
To make matters worse, the dokkaebi Paul appeared and activated a sub-scenario.
<!>[A new sub-scenario has arrived.]
+
<Sub Scenario - Stealing the Throne>
Category: Sub
Difficulty: A
Clear Condition: A new king will soon be born on the Korean Peninsula. Subdue Yoo Joonghyuk, the incarnation who is trying to sit on the throne, and usurp the 'absolute throne'.

Failure: —
+
<@>[Now, everyone. This is your last chance. Will you witness the king's coronation, or will you become the usurper of the throne?]
The intermediate dokkaebi burst into laughter as if enjoying this whole situation.
<!>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' diligently wipes his head.]
<!>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' sighs and looks at the throne.]
<!>[The constellation 'Founder of Hangul' is silent with a sad face.]
<!>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' stares at the god of the other world.]
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' mocks that no one has courage!]
Although the constellations were afraid of the scenery, they did not take their eyes off it.
Even though the scenario was presented, none of the incarnations moved easily.
It was natural.
The person who inherits the throne now is the supreme incarnation, Yoo Joonghyuk.
There was no one who could challenge him, who single-handedly overthrew all kings.
Only one person.
"Yoo Joonghyuk!"
Except me.
"Yoo Joonghyuk! Get some sleep! If you sit there, it’s all over!"
I headed toward the throne, defeated the crowd, and approached the throne.
It must be stopped. It can be prevented. It is not too late.
"Ahjussi."
What held me back was that.
"That’s it."
A slender girl holding a long sword.
"Lee Jihye."
Yoo Joonghyuk's royal guard was blocking the path leading to the throne.
"Now, if you cross this line, you’ll die, you know?"
Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon.
In addition, there were groups of people who followed the king.
"The king! Supreme King!"
"He is the new king of the Korean Peninsula!"
A woman with her white hair disheveled was also seen in the center of the group.
Incarnation Lee Seolhwa.
I realized it again.
Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st round has already gathered so many colleagues.
This guy didn't rest for a single moment, and was steadily taking steps toward the end of this world.
"I said you couldn’t go."
As soon as I took a decisive step, Lee Jihye pulled out her sword. It wasn't just a threat. If I go one step further now, I will definitely get cut.
Lightning struck from the sky, revealing the appearance of Yoo Joonghyuk, who was much closer to the throne.
Han Sooyoung probably fought to stop it on her own.
The last time I met Han Sooyoung, I spoke smugly to her.
I am also the author of this story.
I'll try to convince you.
I will complete the story you wrote.
So what was the story I wrote?
I looked around Gwanghwamun.
Everything was in ruins.
Dying incarnations wriggled on the floor. The stars in the sky twinkled as if they were mocking me.
I thought I could do well.
I believed I knew the whole story too.
<!>[The exclusive skill 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World' activates intermittently.]
Sentences of 'Ways of Survival' heard rarely.
Perhaps this skill is a memory Han Sooyoung gave me.
I smiled bitterly out of frustration.
If I didn't have this skill, I would have died early.
As I slowly took another step forward, Lee Jihye’s sword, which had been pulled out at the same time, reached me.
"If you move any further, I’ll have no choice but to cut you down."
While Yoo Joonghyuk was building his story, where and what was I doing?
<&>「Obviously, there were a lot of stories I wanted to tell.」
I wanted to talk about characters who didn't receive attention in the main story. The lives of extras. I wanted to write a story for those who were forgotten in Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint and could not leave a single line of sentences.
I wanted to save Yoo Joonghyuk from the 41st round.
<&>「Was any of them correct?」
For the first time, I realized my lack of talent as a writer.
"I am."
<&>「I couldn't change this story.」
I took one more step, looking straight at Lee Jihye’s sword.
<&>「If this is my karma for ruining the story.」
Lee Jihye's eyes, having decided on something, were colored with a harsh light. The moment when the girl's sword rushed towards me with the sound of cutting the wind.
"Jihye-ssi."
Someone grabbed Lee Jihye's blade.
"Please let Inho-ssi pass."
She was a woman shorter than me.
"Inho-ssi has work to do."
The moment I heard her voice, a small warmth lingered deep in my heart.
<!>[Fable 'Recorder of things that will disappear' begins its storytelling.]
Warmth soon became a sentence.
<&>「The reader who was more scared than anyone else was there.」
Kyung Sein. The second reader I met. Among the characters, the person who likes Jung Heewon the most. He is someone who grew up because he wanted to become strong like Lee Hyunsung.
He must have suffered so much during this time that his body was full of wounds.
"Sein-ssi."
With a trembling body, Kyung Sein looked back at me.
"Inho-ssi."
No matter how strong Kyung Sein became, his opponent was the protagonist of this story.
There is no match for him physically.
Nevertheless, Kyung Sein did not back down.
"I don’t want to see this world destroyed."
Lee Jihye's expression hardened towards me, who listened to those words blankly.
"Are you going to fight us now?"
Her cold magic boiled over in her swordplay. This sword of wisdom, imbued with a deep blue sword, moved.
"Do you know how strong I am?"
If you get hit by something like that, no matter how powerful you are, you cannot avoid fatal injuries.
The moment Kyung Sein, embarrassed, hugged me and bent down, someone struck Lee Jihye's sword and derailed its trajectory. Someone kicked Lee Jihye’s blade.
"What-"
Lee Jihye stepped away while holding her wrist. Kim Namwoon, who was watching the scene, smiled with a happy attitude.
"Oh, what? This is getting fun?"
<&>「There was a reader there who had read more novels than anyone else.」
Literature Girl 64.
Ja Yerin activated [combat action mode] and struck down Lee Jihye's sword.
"Yerin. What is the time limit?"
"3 minutes."
"We have to finish it within that time."
"That’s enough."
<&>「There was a reader there who wanted to be Yoo Joonghyuk more than anyone else.」
Killer King Ja Sungwoo stretched out his hand to me who was sitting on the floor and said.
"Wake up, Kim Dokja."
Even during this time, I stood up while holding his hand, who did not lose sight of the concept.
Lee Jihye growled.
"Are you serious? Do you all want to die?"
"No one wants to die."
<&>「There was a reader there who wanted to see the ending of this world without sacrificing anyone.」
Lee Dansu, who was carrying Shin Yoosoung, put his hand on my shoulder and said,
"Everyone gathered here so that no one would die."
What was so funny about those words? Kim Namwoon, the delusional demon, burst out laughing.
"Hahaha! That’s fun! It’s something you often see in novels."
For a moment, the delusional demon’s sword made a sharp sound and looked at us. Magical power overflowed throughout his body.
"Tell me some great lines like that too, huh?"
As the delusional demon approached in an instant and stretched out his fist, Yerin's body floated in the air.
Kim Namwoon laughed after blocking the arrow fired by the enraged Killer King with his forearm.
"That toy looks fun."
Black Flame stretched out from Kim Namwoon's hand and burned Killer King's bowgun. What saved the siblings, who were suddenly in danger, was a bullet flying from somewhere.
"Second apostle! Get down!"
<&>「There was also a reader there who was more rational than anyone else, but was actually more passionate than anyone else.」
The smoke from the cannonballs covered the area along with the sound of doo-doo-doo-doo.
Ye Hyunwoo ran through the dust and supported his companions. Gong Pildu covered behind him. I also saw Max the dog barking next to me.
"Pierce it! You must never give up the throne!"
With Ye Hyeonwoo’s command, the troops of Chungmuro ran shouting.
But the opponents were Lee Jihye and Kim Namwoon.
"Let's go!"
"Kaaaaaaak!"
People who lost limbs in a single slash screamed. Ja Yerin and Killer King. Lee Dansu and Kyung Sein also joined.
However, they have already overcome the scenario and have exhausted a lot of their stamina.
There was no way they could properly deal with Lee Jihye and Kim Namwoon.
"Inho-ssi, run!"
I ran on the path that they had made for me.
Lee Jihye shouted.
I left behind the dizzying fear of life and quickened my steps. Even though I broke through the two lines of resistance, there were still many troops protecting Yoo Joonghyuk.
All of this was the history built up by Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st round.
"Stop him."
Following Lee Seolhwa's self-righteous command, Yoo Joonghyuk’s followers waved their military flags.
"Kill him! He’s trying to assassinate the king!"
Even if [Incite] was used, it was a difficult number to handle. To force these people to step down through [Incite], I may not have enough magic power to destroy the 'absolute throne'.
It was then that a disturbing noise was heard from the left side of the troops.
"Kaaaaaaaa! What!"
A crowd was running, breaking the ranks of followers.
"Aaaah! Brother Inho!"
A man who bumped his body here and there and pushed in like a tank.
A mother and daughter were also seen swinging kitchen knives to the left and right of the man.
"Bang Cheolsoo!"
As if responding to my shout, Bang Cheolsoo opened the road with a loud shout.
"Go!"
The way to the absolute throne was opened.
<&>「The people that Lee Hakhyun saved were there.」
I ran the road they opened for me.
<&>「As if to say that his story is not wrong.」
The people who lived such a sloppy story. Those who willingly accepted the clumsy changes I wrote, opened the path for me to run.
It was then that something crashed into the center of the road.
A spirit that takes your breath away just by looking at it. A huge shadow as if Mount Tai was blocking my view.
"Inho-ssi. I can’t allow you to advance any more."
Yoo Joonghyuk’s strongest shield, Lee Hyunsung.
His large right hand moved towards my head. It was [Smashing Mount Tai].
I instinctively raised my magic power. If I am hit by that attack, I will be at least seriously injured.
I quickly lowered my head to avoid his right hand. But his left hand was waiting below him. The [Taesan Push] embedded in the shield was pushed exactly in the direction I was avoiding. It was an unavoidable blow. The moment I opened my mouth to activate [Incite].
A loud noise exploded before my eyes.
When I rolled on the floor and looked forward, the first thing I saw was Lee Hyunsung's shocked face.
"How-"
The steel shield that Lee Hyunsung was holding was split in half and rolling on the floor. Something had pushed Lee Hyunsung’s attack and shattered his shield.
I also understood his feelings.
At this point, the only incarnation with that level of power is Yoo Joonghyuk.
<&>「And there was a sword protecting him.」
However, in this 41st round, there was another incarnation with such power.
"Look at this. This is what happens when you leave me and go alone."
The only incarnation in this world who is not afraid of Yoo Joonghyuk's sword.
<&>「The only sword that protected Kim Dokja in the third world line.」
I said her name.
"Heewon-ssi."
"I’ll ask you what happened later, so get up first. There’s something you have to do, right?"
Jung Heewon, the judge of destruction, raised me up and spoke.
"Do your job. I will deal with that big guy."
"Stop!"
Lee Hyunsung stretched out his hand in embarrassment, and Jung Heewon swung her sword at him.
The strongest sword and the strongest shield collided, causing harsh vibrations to echo throughout the area.
After leaving the fight between the two behind, I looked up into the sky.
The distance between the absolute throne that was soaring high into the sky and Yoo Joonghyuk was not much now.
There was no time to hesitate.
"I will receive a hidden scenario reward."
<!>[Pending 'Hidden Scenario' rewards will be paid.]
<!>[You have hunted a disaster for the first time in a scenario!]
<!>[An incredible achievement has been achieved!]
<!>[90,000 coins were obtained!]
…
<!>[The management bureau grants you a scenario privilege.]
<!>[You can choose one of the items below as a reward.]
+
<!>[Black Flame Half Armor: SSS grade]
<!>[Sylphid's Leaping Boots: SSS grade]
<!>[Fire Dragon Egg: SS grade]
…
+
A mental list of perk items.
I answered without even reading the entire list.
"Sylphid’s Leaping Boots."
An item that Kim Dokja did not choose. But for me now, it was an item I needed more than anything else.
<!>[Obtained 'Sylphid’s Leaping Boots '!]
My toes felt cool and a gentle breeze wrapped around my ankles.
<!>[Special option: Activates leap.]
I just stepped into the air with all my might. As I rose all the way to the sky, Yoo Joonghyuk was finally right in front of me.
"Yoo Joonghyuk."
Now I have arrived.
However, I was not yet ready to crush the absolute throne. This was because there was no one to speak up for the proclaimers.
So, for now, I grabbed Yoo Joonghyuk. I thought it was distance that separated him from the throne, but the moment I held on to the guy's arm with all my strength, the space in front of my eyes suddenly shuddered.
<!>[The 'Theatre of the Beginning' is activated.]
My vision swirled as if I was being sucked into a wall. When I came to my senses from dizziness. I was thrown into an unfamiliar place.
—Yoo Joonghyuk! Yoo Joonghyuk!
—Now the era of supremacy begins!
People's shouts heard through old speakers. I blinked and saw a huge screen. The scenery of Gwanghwamun was projected on the screen.
I looked at the scene blankly and slowly turned my head.
The familiar darkness of the theater captivated me. Hundreds of seats that glow in the dark. Hundreds of readers occupied those seats.
<#>【You’ve finally arrived.】
The kkomas Kim Dokja were looking at me. Some have a flushed face, some have a sad face.
In the center of them, someone was talking and clapping his hands at the wall.
<#>【Our abandoned protagonist.】
As expected, he was someone I knew well.
Representative Kim Dokja stood up with a face full of joy and said.
<#>【Let us welcome '49% Kim Dokja' with joy.】
