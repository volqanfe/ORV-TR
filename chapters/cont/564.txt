<title>564 Episode 3. Protagonist(?) (1)
<&>「When you say 'kill', do you mean I have to kill them myself?」
Although it doesn't appear in Omniscient Reader, there is an incarnation that solved the first scenario using 'suicide' in 'Ways of Survival'.
Fingersnapper 'Christina Page'.
A former legal hypnosis specialist at the FBI, she solved the first scenario by brainwashing a criminal she was working with into committing suicide.
'Demagogy Killing.'
The way I was credited was similar.
The characters who believed the misinformation chose to 'take their own lives' because of me, and I was credited for an 'indirect murder' for causing the mass suicide.
I wondered if such a murder was even possible, but it happened.
<!>[The character you are currently possessing is 'Demagogue Cheon Inho'.]
Perhaps it's because he's the one I'm possessing.
<!>[Your attunement to the character you are currently possessing is too high.]
<!>[Disable some of the possessed character's attributes.]
As I looked down at my bloody hands, I slowly realized what I had done.
If I hadn't possessed Cheon Inho, what would have happened to the people of Geumho Station?
<&>「Wouldn't they have been killed by Cheon Inho the same way anyway?」
If so, was it the writer Lee Hakhyun or the character Cheon Inho who killed them?
In this world, am I a murderer who killed people or a writer who described the death of a character?
As I breathed in and out, my complicated thoughts quickly subsided.
<!>[The exclusive attribute is activated.]
Now was not the time for moral tension.
I would encounter people like Life Leader Kim Cheolyang many times in the future.
I must continue to live in this world by killing people.
<!>[Compensation settlement is delayed due to an unexpected scenario check. Please wait.]
At least until I figure out the secrets of this world.
<!>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is interested in you.]
<!>[The constellations of the 'absolute evil' system are interested in you.]
<!>[A few constellations are curious about your name.]
I came to my senses as the messages from the constellations began in earnest.
<!>[The constellations of the 'absolute evil' system are backing you.]
<!>[Constellations have sponsored you 300 coins.]
I had the attention of the constellations of the 'absolute evil' system.
Apparently, they had interpreted my 'demagogy killing' in a malicious way.
This did not bode well.
This will make it harder for me to get sponsorship from the constellations of the 'absolute good' system.
<!>[The constellations of the 'absolute good' system are shocked by the local tragedy.]
<!>[The constellations of the 'absolute good' system are moved by your heroism.]
Huh?
<!>[The constellations of the 'absolute good' system are impressed by your good intentions in trying to save everyone.]
<!>[Constellations have sponsored you 300 coins.]
<!>[The constellations of the 'absolute evil' system are questioning what the hell are they talking about.]
Everyone seems to have their own interpretation of this.
"Hey...... are you all right?"
I turned my head to see the worried-looking reader ahjussi.
"Uh, yeah. And you?"
"I'm fine. I hope so."
The reader ahjussi's face was still white. It would be even stranger if he was still sane under the circumstances.
I stiffly bowed my head in greeting.
"Thank you for earlier. You saved my life."
Honestly, the credit should go to him, not me.
He fought against the Cheoldoo Group's boss to save me with a physique that was at least as good as Kim Dokja's.
<!>[The constellations of the 'absolute good' system's eyes are shining.]
However, he was actually embarrassed.
"No, rather, I am owe you. If you hadn't saved me, I would be lying there too, but...... the germs worked for you?"
Ahjussi still doesn't know that I 'demagogy killed' the people of Geumho Station.
I thought about just being honest, but I figured it was probably better not to.
"I don't know either, they also killed germs together......."
"Maybe only your germs died? Although I don't know if that's possible......."
He seemed to conclude that was the only answer. Instead of answering him, I looked toward the bodies.
He interpreted my silence and he quickly added.
"It's not your fault, you did the best you could."
The reader ahjussi let out a small sigh, looked at me with a pitying look on his face, and then looked back at the dead people and muttered.
"Honestly..... they didn't seem to be good people."
I felt guilty for trying to deceive a naive middle-aged man, but I thought it was better than telling him the truth.
<!>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' admires your wickedness.]
<!>[The constellation 'Woman Who Pours Water into a Bottomless Pit' is touched by your heart.]
Which character does this ahjussi possess, anyway?
Given his unfamiliar appearance, I'm pretty sure he's an extra.
Come to think of it, I have the skill to figure it out.
<!>[The information of this person can't be read in 'Character List'.]
<!>[This person is a 'character' but not a 'character'.]
I see what the situation is.
This man's body is a character, but the man's spirit that's possessing it is not.
<!>[The exclusive skill has been activated.]
It was then that a strange message popped up.
<!>[The exclusive skill 'Readers' Comments List' has been activated.]
Readers' Comments List?
<!>[Do you want to use 'Readers' Comments List' in this person?]
I nodded tentatively.
<!>[Checking the reader's profile information.]
+
ID: wldbsdldkQk80
Platform: Textia
Total Comments : 32
Reader level : 16
+
<!> You can use coins to view the comments written by this reader.
<!> Number of comments currently available for free: 3.
No, I can see this?
I looked at the sorrowful ahjussi's profile.
Should I see just one?
+
Jiyoon-ah, are you reading a novel in your room again?
—(Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, Chapter 1)
+
Ahjussi's first comment immediately came to my mind.
The story about having a daughter must be true.
Just one more.
+
Jiyoon-ah, open the door. I know you're reading the novel.
—(Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, Chapter 7)
+
I thought I knew how this ahjussi came to found Omniscient Reader.
I've already seen two, so let's just take a look at the rest.
+
How do I pay for the next episode?
—(Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, Chapter 25)
+
<!>[Pay coins to see additional comments.]
For some reason, I felt like I could trust this man.
Feeling unnecessarily apologetic, I held out my hand to him.
"Allow me to introduce myself."
"Okay."
"My name is Cheon Inho."
I could see him flustered by my words.
I pointed a finger at my face and smiled weakly.
"That's his name."
"Oh, I see, that sounds like a name I've heard before......."
He didn't seem to recognize Cheon Inho.
"He's the villain in the beginning, at Geumho Station."
"Oh......!"
"Yeah. That's right, the bad guy."
He had other nicknames, such as 'the one to be teared to death' and 'someone to burn to death with Hellfire', but I didn't say those.
Ahjussi's face had already turned pale.
"W-what should we do then?"
"It's still early, so there's room for renewal, right? What about you? Who are you?"
"I'm Lee Dansoo...... it says."
That seems to be the name of the person ahjussi's possessing.
Lee Dansoo, Lee Dansoo.
I didn't remember anything off the top of my head.
By the way, if he knows the name of the person he's possessing, can he see his attribute window?
"I'll give you my attributes and skills......."
"Wait, you can't say things like that."
"What? Oh, yeah."
The old man came to his senses as if he had remembered something.
"You sound just like Kim Dokja, hehe."
"Yeah. It's better to act like him right now."
"Did you finish reading 'that novel'?"
"Yes."
Well, technically, I didn't read it, I wrote it.
"Then everyone who read that novel is like us......."
I suddenly realized what he was thinking.
"Don't worry too much. I'm sure they all survived, just like us."
Especially his daughter.
She didn't study, she just read Omniscient Reader, so she 100% survived. The old man smiled weakly.
"Thank you."
"Shall we call ourselves by the names we just mentioned from now one?"
"All right."
He nodded, his eyes slightly relaxed.
It wasn't like we'd had a conversation where he'd asked me who was my favorite, but I felt like we'd suddenly formed a plausible bond.
But that was the end of our fraternity.
<!>[Survivors from the areas 3-4 of Geumho Station: Cheon Inho, Lee Dansoo. A total of 2 survivors.]
The system message that had been interrupted began to play again.
<!>[Additional compensation settlement will begin.]
<!>[200 coins have been earned as additional compensation.]
Subsequently, Bihyung appeared out of thin air. I didn't know what it was, but it was a sign that I had finally solved the first scenario's many problems.
<@>[It's really weird. There were some unusual areas, but none of them solved the scenario in this way...... I never thought you could to use the <Star Stream>'s 'directing system' in this way.......]
Bihyung looked down at me and grumbled for a while, before smiling wryly and saying.
<@>[Anyway, congratulations, you passed the first scenario with flying colors.]
I already knew what Bihyung was going to say next. Probably the same goes for the man next to me.
<@>[Now, shouldn't there be a reward for overcoming the hardships? As a reward for the first scenario, you're entitled the sponsorship of the 'constellations'. Waahhh! How about it? Aren't you looking forward to it?]
We were about to embark on the first key event of 'Omniscient Reader', the Sponsor Selection.
However, Bihyung scratched his head.
<@>[Hmm, that's weird. You are not surprised nor confused.......]
Of course not, we already knew that.
You'll be just like me after you've said the same line a hundred times.
<@>[If you haven't realized by now, you are incredible weak, and if you are thrown into the scenarios that will take place.......]
You won't be able to catch a single ground rat.
I know.
Bihyung gave his speech with an expression of bewilderment as he saw me yawning, stopping only when he heard the constellations' bitter comments.
<!>[A few constellations are tired of Bihyung's explanations.]
<!>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' urges him to get on with it!]
The constellations twinkled above Bihyung's head, which seemed to brighten at first glance.
I wonder how many people have gathered for this <Sponsor Selection>?
<@>[Anyway, the constellations are impatient. Let's get started!]
It was still very early in the story, so I didn't expect any great constellations to come.
There's a possibility that a great constellation like Great Sage, Heaven's Equal or Uriel will appear to Kim Dokja, but that's only because he was the protagonist.
At best, I'll have the 'Monarch of the Small Fries' or something.
I didn't expect it.
I really didn't expect that much.
But.......
It won't be Great Sage, but...... there could be a good constellation, right?
I had a really hard time.......
And a screen popped up in front of me.
<!>[There are a total of 10 constellations waiting for your choice.]
