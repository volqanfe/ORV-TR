<title>639 Episode 16 Mad Butcher (8)
The deity of the other world who was struck by lightning groaned as it poured out fragments of stories.
Fragments of stories that had lost their context were split into words and then disappeared into consonants or vowels.
<!>[Constellation 'The Last Ark' has achieved its longing.]
<!>[Constellation 'The Last Ark' is released from the contract with the Outer God.]
As expected, the ark was bound by a contract with the Outer God.
<!>[The constellation 'The Last Ark' expresses his gratitude to you.]
<!>[The constellation 'The Last Ark' tells you his story.]
I was surprised.
No matter how much I did, you're already giving away your own story?
However, there was no time to check what story I had received.
<#>【Go each go ah no kid】
The 'Outer God' that had not yet disappeared dragged its upper body and howled.
<#>【Gear▪️You are g▪️▪️… will be angry】
Anyway, it has to end.
I am ready to activate [All-In-One] once again.
<#>【You are not a recorder.】
He looked back at me with his cunning eyes.
Hwa-ah-ah, and the whole story of that guy was scattered like sand blowing in the wind. I couldn't feel his energy.
I had an ominous feeling.
Where did he go?
Just in time, the space spun once, and I was also forcibly thrown out of the snowfield.
I came out.
As soon as my blackened vision returned, what I saw was an old unarmed floor. The scent of blood hung on the tip of my nose.
I staggered and looked around.
How are the others?
My hearing returned, and I heard the voices of people buzzing everywhere. The sound of sharp bouncing weapons brought me to full reality.
The fight was still going on.
"Everyone stand back!"
Fortunately, the other world’s invasion seemed to have stopped.
Dozens of Jiangshi left.
It was also a sign that it was being organized smoothly under the leadership of Jung Heewon.
Where did that guy go?
He must have escaped here, but there was no trace of the Outer God anywhere.
My eyes met Jung Heewon’s, who was watching this from afar. As I was about to open my mouth, Jung Heewon opened her eyes wide and cried out.
"Avoid!"
When I turned around with a chilly feeling, something attacked from behind.
Among the 7th grade, it was Steel City.
Damn, was there still one left?
However, the condition of the monster was a bit strange.
<!>[A 7th grade alien species, 'Steel City' attempts : Explosion of blood points.]
Blood points. The dark red aura that wrapped around his whole body was expanding as if it would explode. I can understand what kind of technology it is without having to explain it.
I lightly moved my feet and tried to run away from him. However.
<!>[Physical ability has been drastically reduced due to the penalty of 'incite'.]
The recoil of the [Incite] I used earlier has finally returned. My feet didn't move on my own. For an instant, a cold sweat broke out on my back.
"Get out of the way!"
Fortunately, Jung Heewon was faster. At this rate, Jung Heewon will save me before Steel City explodes.
However, the price was strange. A chilly feeling, as if I left out an important sentence on the page I just wrote.
Behind Jung Heewon's back, squeezing between the ranks of Jiangshi, another Steel City was running.
<!>[The 7th grade alien species, 'Steel City' attempts a 'Blood Point Explosion'!]
Damn.
There was one more.
And where the Jiangshi was headed.
<&>「You aren’t a recorder」
The last words left by the Outer God rang in my ears.
I cried reflexively.
"Heewon-ssi! Block it from behind!"
Realizing something, Jung Heewon looked where my gaze was heading.
<!>[The activation conditions for the exclusive skill '□□' have been met.]
<!>[Entering the snow field.]
The world quickly turned achromatic. Fortunately, the skill was activated in time.
<!>[Exclusive skill '□□' has been activated.]
<!>[A branch of an important event has occurred.]
I quickly looked around in the still landscape.
Skill '□□' is activated only when a character wants to do an 'unexpected action' or when an 'important event' divergence occurs.
This time, it was said to be a branch of 'important events'.
In other words, it means that an event that will become a turning point in the development of this world will begin right here and now.

#Mad Butcher
<&>「At that moment, Jung Heewon □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□…」
*You can add up to 300 characters based on your current proficiency level.
+
<!>[You can stay in the 'Snowfield' for a total of 8 minutes.]
I blankly stared at the title of the scene.
'Mad Butcher'.
Yoo Jonghyuk of the 41st turn said.
If I want to be his ally, recruit the 'Mad Butcher' as an ally.
It wasn't difficult at this point.
Soon, I will be able to gain Yoo Jonghyuk’s trust and plan my survival in this turn. That's it.
Certainly, when I first possessed a character in this world, I was a person who just needed that.
<&>「But now, Lee Hakhyun didn't know if that was the right thing to do.」
I was out of breath. Space and time stopped, and even though my body was stiff, my heart was beating without rest.
<&>「Lee Hakhyun didn't want to bring 'Mad Butcher' to Yoo Jonghyuk.」
There are stories I don't want to write about as a writer. I also have the freedom not to write a story I don't want to write.
Because now I knew who the 'Mad Butcher' was.
However, when I realized that the ending of a dazzling turn was right in front of me, and that the story would be completed with just one more sentence, how many writers could reject the last sentence?
<!>[The protagonist of this stage was Jung Heewon.]
Jung Heewon, who was running toward me, was looking back.
I was in front of her, and her younger brother Jung Eunho was behind her.
It was fine until there.
The problem was that two Jiangshi in both directions were each targeting us.
They were running towards me in one way, and running towards Jung Eunho on the other.
Both Jiangshis are preparing for a self-destruct attack.
Those she doesn't save will die with a high probability.
After calming down, I organized the sentences in my head.
The title of this scene is 'Mad Butcher'.
However, it was not written who it was or what it was about. It is me who writes it down. It is also me who completes this story.
I started writing sentences.
Sincerely, with dense sentences. With the best expressions I can write.
<&>「So, Jung Heewon miraculously saved both of them. (Total 297 characters)」
Even though I wrote that.
<!>[This is absolutely impossible.]
<!>[The success rate of reproducing this description is less than 0.01%.]
<!>[You lack the probability allowed.]
<!>[Read reader feedback.]
0.01%.
+
rlaehrwk37: …
rlaehrwk78: Honestly this is far-fetched
+
I knew that too.
It was physically impossible for the current Jung Heewon to save both me and her brother.
Still, until now, how many times have I made a similar argument?
On the bridge where I met Yoo Jonghyuk, just as I sacrificed my arms to save the others.
I wrote the sentence over and over again.
If this is not possible, I can give up a few things. Her younger brother is somehow saved, and I am severely injured, but I have to write it in the form of surviving.
<!>[The success rate of reproducing this description is less than 0.01%.]
<!>[You lack the probability allowed.]
…
<!>[The success rate of reproducing this description is less than 0.01%.]
<!>[You lack the probability allowed.]
…
It was strange.
No matter how it was used, the success rate of reproduction was absurdly low.
…
<!>[Check reader feedback]
+
rlaehrwk99: Are important people unconditionally saved?
rlaehrwk141: Then that's a bit obvious
+
A storm rose in my head.
I knew it was a story lacking in probability. However, the reaction of readers was shocking.
+
rlaehrwk41: Didn't Omniscient Reader explode people's heads from the beginning?
rlaehrwk37: Be quiet newbie
rlaehrwk124: Bittersweet but that's what makes it fun
+
In the feedback from the following readers, it was seen that the time of the timer was decreasing.
<!>[The time limit is 2 minutes.]
I saw Jung Heewon, and I saw Jung Eunho. I don't have time anymore. There were not many sentences to write.
In a world where everything I write becomes reality, what sentence should a writer write?
What sentences can he write?
What does it mean to write a good work as a writer?
I still don't know the answer.
<!>[You lack the probability allowed.]
Allowed probability.
Fortunately, I had the probability points I had accumulated so far.
Can 'probability points' make the impossible possible? As with Jung Heewon’s awakening, if I use the collected probability once again—
<!>[Currently, 'probability input' is impossible due to a skill error.]
Skill error.
Come to think of it, since the last fight with Han Sooyoung, the skill [□□] has gone sour.
<!>[You have 1 minute left on the time limit.]
My hair gradually turned white.
If this continues, either I or Jung Eunho will surely die.
<&>「At that time, someone came into Lee Hakhyun’s field of view.」
I blankly opened my mouth.
Perhaps.
<&>「There was only one way that Jung Eunho and I can both live.」
I looked at one person.
It was like lightning flashed in my head. Even though I knew I shouldn't use it like that, I couldn't stop my hand. As if my hand existed to complete that sentence.
And.
<&>「… It was the end of the story that the reader wanted. (Total 297 characters)」
<!>[The success rate of reproducing the description is over 90%.]
<!>[You have described plausible content.]
Surprisingly high reproduction success rate.
The skill was talking, and readers were talking.
+
rlaehrwk37: This is how it ends
rlaehrwk99: (tears)
rlaehrwk41 : Sniff
+
My writing hand trembled
Readers were right. If Jung Eunho and I were to survive at the same time, this was the only way.
But this was a story that shouldn't be written.
No matter how perfect a story is, there are definitely stories that shouldn't be written.
That was the story for me now.
I erased all the sentences I had written and started writing again.
<&>「Lee Hakhyun has made up his mind.」
Even if the reproduction success rate is 0.01%
<!>[The time limit is 30 seconds.]
<!>[This description is absolutely impossible.]
<!>[The success rate of reproducing this description is less than 0.01%.]
This time, impossible.
Let's write a good story.
<!>[There are 20 seconds left.]
<!>[This is absolutely impossible.]
<!>[The success rate of reproducing this description is less than 0.01%]
Never give up, over and over again.
Again and again.
<!>[The time limit is 10 seconds.]
<!>[This is absolutely impossible.]
<!>[The success rate of reproducing this description is less than 0.01%.]
…
Why can't I just write this story?
<!>[Exiting from 'Snowfield'.]
The colors of the world were returning. In the midst of that soaring landscape, I thought maybe I was not qualified as a writer.
I wrote what I wanted to write, not sentences to complete the work.
The success rate was slim, and the reproduction success rate was close to zero.
Still, I prayed.
If anyone is reading this story, please add some plausibility to it.
<!>[Failed to reproduce the scene.]
The first message I heard.
A feeling of desolation flooded into my lungs.
The sentences I wrote were not reproduced. They did not become a reality.
However.
<&>「Does the failed sentence remain in the story?」
The moment I heard the sentence that followed, goosebumps ran through my body.
Because I knew that sentence.
<&>「Lee Hakhyun screamed.」
That sentence is a sentence I wrote and then erased.
"No! Go back! Hurry up!"
<&>「In an instant, Jung Heewon made a choice.」
But actually, it was a story that I didn't even want to write.
"Inho-ssi!"
<&>「'Saving Cheon Inho.'」
Jung Heewon, holding me, kicked at Steel City, who rushed towards me.
The moment this sound floated in the air, Jung Heewon activated [Ghost Killing] and [Time of Judgment].
She threw the knife with Kwon Nong's sword directly into the monster at the time of reduction.
With the overwhelming cutting power of the blade, Steel City could not attack and was cut in two on the spot.
The problem was the opposite.
"Jung Eunho!"
I saw the Steel City running toward Jung Eunho, who had collapsed on the floor.
I could feel the disquieting legend of 'Outer God' in the whole body of the monster. At the last moment, the Steel City was smiling at me.
<&>「Why are they doing this?」
I actually know the answer.
<&>「They want to be recorded in this story.」
It felt like everything in the world was flowing slowly, in slow motion.
A Steel City that runs while blowing smoke from its head. People's screams. Sergeant Kim shouting. Jung Heewon hurriedly turned around. In order to prevent the Steel City reaching out toward Jung Eunho from happening again, I changed the order of the sentences, changed the words, and wrote new sentences over and over again.
And I thought.
How many times did this incident happen in 'Ways of Survival'?
How many times did Jung Eunho die here, and how many times did Jung Heewon lose her younger brother here?
And.
<&>「How many times did Jung Heewon have to become a 'Mad Butcher'?」
As I moved my gaze, my eyes met someone who happened to be standing near Jung Eunho.
In this eternity, only the two of us were looking at each other and thinking the same thing.
I don't know him.
How old he is, where he lives, what he likes.
I don't know anything.
All I know is he read this story
I reached out for him.
I wanted to shout. Tried to tell him to stop.
An explosion occurred with a roar, and people around the stage flew through the air and fell to the floor.
With the sound of heavy breathing, the speed of time returned to normal.
<&>「This story is still 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』.」
And Jung Heewon and I ran towards Jung Eunho at the same time.
<&>「Therefore, written for only one reader.」
In the white dust, I saw Jung Eunho's skull mask that had fallen to the floor.
Jung Heewon called Jung Eunho by name.
<&>「It was completed at the sacrifice of only one reader at the same time.」
A man was holding Jung Eunho tightly. The man's face was covered in blood.
All the flesh on his back had been ripped off, and the organs that had been burned to expose the bones had already run out of function. It was a wound that he could not survive.
Jung Heewon slumped on the ground.
I staggered over and shook him.
It can't be like this.
There is no reason why you should be like this, not anyone else.
He won't die. He has [strong bones] and [heavy bones].
The man who raised his head with difficulty was looking at Jung Heewon.
I remembered the comments he had made belatedly.
He was a man about to enlist and decided to confess to his crush.
I also remembered what I saw of him.
He was a man afraid of death.
He was a man who betrayed his fellow kinsfolk and committed himself to the Beggar Sect, and he was a sergeant who suddenly abandoned his children.
He was not Jung Heewon's father.
He just read the story, and the audience was drawn to it.
Nevertheless, on the stage of this tragedy, he said a single line he had been practicing.
"Good job, Heewon-ya."
