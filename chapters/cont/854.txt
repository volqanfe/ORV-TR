<title>854 Episode 46 Big Joke (5)
Strength and strength. Will and will. Stories and stories clashed.
It was a great clash of light that I had never seen before. Something flashed before my eyes, and my vision briefly blacked out and then came back.
Someone screamed. The sound of gasping for breath. The smell of something burning.
And when I opened my eyes again.
"Supreme King!"
I saw Anna Croft, who had been rolling around in the dust, reaching out her hand towards me.
What happened?
Stories poured out of Yoo Joonghyuk's mouth. I had an ominous feeling.
Damn it, did I fail?
"You succeeded."
As if he had read my mind, Yoo Joonghyuk answered calmly.
Zeus's lightning, which had spread like fog, dispersed, and an empty hole was visible in the air. The trace of the Soul Killing Spear tearing through space. Between the sparks of lightning that were flying, I saw Zeus's incarnation with one arm and side blown off.
<!>[The Constellation, 'Seat of Lightning', received a great shock to his incarnation body!]
"Now."
With Yoo Joonghyuk's words, I released [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint]. As my soul returned to my body, sparks rippled throughout my body.
With strength in my aching muscles, I staggered toward the passage on the other side.
Zeus, who had found me like that, unleashed an electric shock with his half-remaining incarnation. Yoo Joonghyuk stepped forward and blocked the electric shock. Even as his skin burned black, the guy didn't take his eyes off me.
"Go quickly! I can't hold out for long!"
Of course. Even if he was half Zeus, he was still a Myth-grade. He wasn't someone Yoo Joonghyuk could face to buy time on his own. He was even protected by the 'Giant Nebula'. Anna Croft, standing next to Yoo Joonghyuk who was swearing with bloodshot eyes, joined in.
"Go, Cheon Inho."
If Anna Croft pushed herself that far, it must mean that she could somehow hold out with [Future Sight].
I immediately activated [Way of the Wind] and started running.
—No matter what happens in the middle, just keep running until the end. There is a power room at the end of the straight line.
I believed Yoo Joonghyuk's words and ran.
Indeed, when I reached the middle of the hallway, the surrounding scenery changed and a new world unfolded.
'The Last Ark' is a stage that gathers the 'Great Tales' of each Nebula. So it was inevitable that various worldviews would be mixed up.
While running through the hallway, I ran through Tartarus of the <Underworld>, ran through the Temple of <Olympus>, and crossed Bifrost of <Asgard>.
<@>[Chase! Catch him!]
Soon after, Constellations chasing me appeared from somewhere.
Did they break through Yoo Joonghyuk and Anna Croft?
The sound of Zeus's lightning that could be heard from afar was also gradually getting closer. For a moment, my vision flashed, and someone pushed me away and took the lightning instead.
"Go, disciple."
When on earth did they enter the ark?
Cheok Jungyeong and Kyrgios were there.
"If you're my disciple, you can run faster than that."
I nodded at Kyrgios's words.
<!>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' begins its storytelling.]
As soon as Kim Dokja's story came to me, [Bookmark] was activated in my head. I immediately put 'Kyrgios Rodgraim' in the bookmark.
<&>「Big and small ultimately depend on the perception of existence, so the existence that can freely control that cognitive realm is the greatest.」
<!>['Bookmark' is activated!]
<!>[Your understanding of the person in question is considerable!]
Is it worth listening to the difficult words so far?
<!>[Your enlightenment increases due to the effect of 'Abstruse Murim Dumplings'!]
Or, it may be the effect of the strange dumplings I ate then.
<!>[The level of the person in question is too high to fully reproduce the skill.]
<!>[The level of the skill being activated is forcibly adjusted.]
Kim Dokja's main skill. Baekcheong's bright light soon covered my entire body.
<!>[The exclusive skill, 'Full Personification Lv. 10', is activated.]
<!>[Your current physical composition is different from that of the character.]
<!>[Your current physical composition cannot use 'Full Electrification.]
<!>[A powerful skill penalty is eating away at your body!]
I see. [Full Electrification] is a skill that only "dwarves" can use.
However.
<!>[Your 'status' overcomes the skill penalty!]
If the caster's 'Strength' exceeds a certain level, even non-dwarves can temporarily use [Full Personification].
Kugugugugugu!
Even with destructive power several times its original value.
<@>[Kuaaaaak!]
The Constellations that were blocking my path fell away like moths, burning.
<@>[What, what is that!]
Since I had already exhausted my mental power with [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint], the time I could maintain [Full Electrification] was less than 10 seconds. However, I was able to move quite a distance in just those 10 seconds.
Kuduk.
Cheon Inho's knees buckled as he could not withstand the power of [Full Electrification]. The [Bookmark] disappeared. I limped on my injured knee and continued to run.
They were not swept away by the storm of [Full Electrification]. The Constellations began to rush toward me again.
I still couldn't see the power room.
What should I do? Should I use [Incite]? Or should I use [Bookmark] again? If not—
"Come to your senses. You who deceived the stars."
The man who said those words was an unexpected person. He supported me and walked about fifteen steps, then blasted the Constellations that were rushing toward me.
"If you die, the last of humanity will die too. Do you intend to make my efforts go to waste?"
He was the Blood Demon who had been resurrected by my [Deceased Summoning].
The Blood Demon's corpses that had entered the ark together rushed toward the Constellations.
Even as his arms flew away and his thighs burst, the Blood Demon did not give up and shouted.
"Go. Go and prove that humanity has survived until the end."
Then came the sound of the Blood Demon's corpses being torn apart. Lightning strikes continued to strike from the angry sky. At that moment, I thought that I could not avoid it this time.
"Evil Sophist."
This time, someone carried me. At the same time, the falling lightning lost its way and scattered.
"My ability here can only last 5 minutes."
Ye Hyunwoo, the 'Disappearing One'.
His skill of making existence disappear finally shone in the Last Scenario.
The Ten Evils that I had revived just before coming here were there.
Kyung Sein, who was guarding the path I had walked, shouting. Lee Dansu, who was setting up a trap. Kang Ilhun, who was spreading false rumors, saying, "Cheon Inho ran away in the opposite direction!"
Finally, a small door appeared at the end of the hallway.
Ye Hyunwoo, whose skill's duration had ended, put me down and said.
"It was a good thing I didn't disappear this time."
Leaving these words behind, Ye Hyunwoo fought against the Constellations with the remaining Ten Evils.
I looked at the backs of the Ten Evils for a moment.
Has Cheon Inho seen the same scenery as me? What is the guy who pushed me into this Fault thinking as he reads this story?
Soon, the cold handle felt in my hand.
<!>[The 'Myth-grade Constellations' belonging to the final ark are astonished!]
The ecstatic smell of stories is felt as soon as the door is opened. The 'power source' that condensed the most dazzling stories of this world line was glowing yellow in the center of the room. It was the 'Story Core' that I had been looking for.
Without hesitation, I reached out to the Story Core.
<!>[You have acquired the 'Story Core'.]
If I destroy this, the Last Scenario will end.
<!>[Some 'Myth-grade Constellations' try to persuade you!]
<!>[The Giant Nebula, <Asgard>, wants to offer you a chance to 'board the ark'!]
<!>[The Giant Nebula, <Vedas>, offers you a piece of <Locapala>!]
…
The messages from the Myth-grade Constellations surged into my head.
"If I was going to stop here, I wouldn't have even started."
<!>[Many 'Myth-grade Constellations' say that if you don’t stop right now…!]
I struck the Story Core with all my might. Perhaps because it was a condensed story, the core didn’t break easily.
I struck it, and struck it again.
The Story Core began to crack little by little.
<!>[The Constellation, 'Lightning Seat', spews out his terrifying rage at you!]
Zeus's lightning bolt belatedly pierced through the engine room and exploded.
I laughed even as I felt the pain of my body burning.
"It’s too late, you son of a bitch."
The moment I struck the core for the last time, there was a sound of something breaking. The enormous story that the Constellations had gathered to cross world lines was released, and a pillar of light rose toward the sky.
<!>[Someone has achieved the clear condition of the 'Last Scenario'!]
<!>[The <Star Stream>'s probability changes drastically!]
<!>[The entrance to the sealed wall opens!]
When I blinked again, I was in a completely different place.
A huge wall of text surrounded my eyes.
I realized where I was.
<&>「He couldn't tell if it was his thoughts or a record written on the wall. However, what was certain was that everything he thought, said, and did was written on the wall in front of him.」
I had finally arrived.
<&>「The 'Final Wall' was there.」
I slowly placed my hand on the wall and the [Fourth Wall] reacted.
<!>[The Exclusive Skill, 'Fourth Wall', activates!]
<!>[The 'Final Wall' accepts your presence.]
My body seemed to be seeping in like a fluid, and before I knew it, I was inside the wall.
I looked around, steadying my staggering body.
A room made up of dazzlingly glowing hologram monitors. It was a room I knew, a room I had experienced well.
<&>「The 'Dokkaebi King' was there.」
It was dozens of times the size of an average dokkaebi. No matter how I looked at it, it looked extremely obese.
I wonder what it had been eating right before I came in.
The guy who had been chewing something in his mouth turned his huge head and looked at me.
<@>[Huh? What is it.]
The eyes of the one who had watched the 'scenarios' the longest.
I was momentarily overwhelmed by that gaze and lost my words.
The Dokkaebi King slowly got up from his seat and stood in front of me with his belly rippling, then lowered his head and began to observe me.
<@>[How did you get here? This is not a place you are allowed to be?]
The Dokkaebi King's large fingers touched my head. Even though my body would explode if I were crushed, I couldn't move a finger.
A spark lightly shot up and an interested expression appeared on the Dokkaebi King's face.
<@>[Look at this. This isn't a normal worldline.]
With just one finger, the Dokkaebi King seemed to understand how I existed here.
<@>[Using real life to create elaborate fakes. How could you… I see. You.]
With a small exclamation, the Dokkaebi King nodded.
<@>[You are a being who 'can't help but do that'.]
I tried to open my mouth somehow. I tried to ask something.
But my lips wouldn't open. As if 'this story after this has all been decided', my body didn't move at all.
As if he had guessed my state, the Dokkaebi King smiled.
<@>[Everything is already written, and is being written at the same time. You came to confirm the 'true ending' of this world line.]
The Dokkaebi King smiled kindly and handed me a story fragment.
<!>[This is what you were looking for. Small and amazing star.]
And the moment I held the story, the stage of the world went dark.
<!>[You have successfully cleared all the tasks of the 'Time Fault'!]
<!>[All the 'Recorders of Fear' sigh at your amazing interpretation.]
<!>[The 'Recorders of Fear' are discussing your interpretation reward.]
<!>[The 'King of Fear' rises from the throne.]
…
<!>[■■-level Fear, the 'Final Chapter' of the 'Evil Sophist' is playing.]
The old ending of the 40th Round began to be written on the 'Final Wall'.
