<title>614 Episode 12 □□ (5)
Han Sooyoung asked.
"Why did you come?"
It was a chance to finally make up for their long years.
Nevertheless, Yoo Jonghyuk abandoned the opportunity and came here with Biyoo.
"If he’s here."
Yoo Jung-hyeok looked at the door of the hospital room and continued.
"And I had a hunch that he was going to do something strange."
"You know you can’t return, right?"
A regressor who has lived for a long time.
Yoo Jonghyuk, who has now stopped even returning, made the same choice as her at the end of this story.
Han Sooyoung couldn't help but open her mouth.
"Well, even if you go through the first door, you'll end up unemployed again. You say you don't even play games anymore?"
"I will open it this time."
Yoo Jung-hyeok's rough palm touched the doorknob of the hospital room.
The moment the door moved slowly, Han Sooyoung grabbed Yoo Jonghyuk.
"Wait for a sec."
Yoo Jonghyuk looked at Han Sooyoung and said.
"Anyway, there will be no one."
"I know."
This world is 'the world that Kim Dokja did not return to'. So even if he opens the door to the hospital room, Kim Dokja will not be there.
After completing her mental preparation, Han Sooyoung sighed lightly.
"Open it."
In the end, in order to get Kim Dokja back, they have to start from 'losing Kim Dokja'.
Even so, Han Sooyoung could not completely fool herself.
Maybe the analogy was misunderstood. If all of this is a prank by Kim Dokja, like a sentence that was forgotten and added belatedly, if there is the person she has been looking for for a long time in the unfolding scenery…
The wind blew through her hair through the open window.
As expected, no one was on the bed.
But it wasn't anything.
Han Sooyoung, like someone who spilled something on herself, approached the bed with gravity.
A small note was left on the sunken bed, as if someone had been sitting there a while ago.
A memo neatly written in a familiar handwriting
—There's a story I haven't read yet. I'll be right back.
Han Sooyoung read the note over and over again.
This sentence was not a lie.
She heard Yoo Jonghyuk breathe lightly.
Han Sooyoung sat down holding the memo in her arms without even realizing it.
Kim Dokja did not return.
Even so, Han Sooyoung seemed to forgive him.
"You damn child..."
He was obviously alive.
They can't see him, but somewhere far away in the universe.
Kim Dokja is still reading an unfinished story.
***
In the faint spark, I read the story of Han Sooyoung.
<&>「"I will find him with Biyoo. Now that the system is open, I can search the bottom of the world line again."」
Stories that are heard in sparsely fragmented forms.
Among them, there was the voice of Yoo Jonghyuk , the voice of Han Sooyoung, and there was also a voice whose identity was unknown.
<&>「"Then check the world line over there..."」
<&>「"I think if you’re a real reader hyung, you’ll definitely be here."」
<&>「"If it's the price to tell you where Kim Dokja is, how about it?"」
Han Sooyoung's hardened face could be seen over the flowing story.
I opened my mouth as I heard Seolhwa's voice slowly diminishing.
"It would have been fine if you had chosen the first 'portal'."
She could be happy.
She could have met Kim Dokja again and have the long-awaited ending.
"There must be an ending like that somewhere."
Han Sooyoung answered while watching the disappearing sentences.
A 'happy ending' already existed.
However, she did not choose that option.
"There are two options. One is the end for anyone to see, and the other is somewhat suspicious. In such a situation, it is obvious what the real Kim Dokja would choose. Because that damn guy likes 'stories' more than anyone else."
In a sense, her choice was not wrong. She eventually found the traces of Kim Dokja and came this far.
"Kim Dok-ja can make his imagination become real. Because his dream is reality. Kim Dokja in 'The First Portal' must have been real too."
"Maybe it was."
Han Sooyoung nodded her head.
Since she acknowledged that possibility as well, she probably did not force her choice on Jung Heewon or the other members of Kim Dokja’s company.
However, Han Sooyoung must have come up with another possibility.
A possibility that Kim Dokja is alone with the tragedy of the far-off universe, with <Kim Dokja’s Company> confined in happy memories.
She, with her great imagination, couldn't bear to turn away from that possibility.
"I just picked the one I thought was more like Kim Dokja."
I was a bit envious of Kim Dokja at the upright confidence felt in her tone.
"Kim Dokja is in this world?"
"I don't know either. but..... At least you can see this world."
At last her grand story stopped talking. The wound I inflicted on the story had been repaired.
"I don't like it. Because this isn't a story I wrote."
Her story, which she once started, is now flowing into a development she does not know.
Han Sooyoung and I looked up at the sky at the same time. The color was slowly returning to the sky of the snowfield, which had been full of achromatic colors.
The skill's time limit was already running out.
"For him to come back, this story must end."
Because it was right after seeing the giant story, I could agree with her words to some extent.
But that wasn't the end, at least not now.
That's why I constantly wrote sentences in my head.
<!>[You have described a content lacking in probability.]
<!>[The success rate of reproducing this description is 8%.]
<!>[You have described the content lacking in probability.]
<!>[The success rate of reproducing this description is 1%.]
Throughout the fight with Han Sooyoung, I repeatedly wrote and erased sentences.
In order to find a 'sentence' that will convince Han Sooyoung in front of me.
How many sentences did I edit and rewrite?
<!>[Possible contents have been described.]
<!>[The description has a 78% success rate of reproduction.]
I gambled to increase my success rate. Just like the day I first met Yoo Jonghyuk in the 41st turn, I raised my probability by sacrificing my arms.
<!>[The title of the scene is changed due to the sentence you added.]
I bet everything I could write.
<!>[The success rate of reproducing this description is 95%.]
<!>[You can no longer increase your success rate.]
<!>[Read reader feedback.]
<!>[No reader feedback exists.]
<!>[Every 'reader' in the theater checks out your story.]
<!>[You have secured additional probability with more than a certain number of recommendations.]
I said while looking at the sentence of the snow field I wrote.
"Kim Dokja may want to continue watching the story."
"Maybe, but this story is not worth it."
"What if Dokja Kim’s taste has changed? The story you wrote is no longer interesting."
"That."
Han Soo-young smiled and asked.
"Are you serious?"
The scenery of the snowfield collapsed with a cooing sound.
<!>[Exiting the  'Snowfield'.]
The stopped time started to flow again.
Taking advantage of Han Sooyoung's surprise, I shouted at Jung Heewon.
"Heewon-ssi!"
Jung Heewon, who was still resisting the mental attack, turned to me with a creak.
I wasn't sure if I could give more mental load to the target who had already used [Incite].
Jung Heewon's lips said.
'Inho-ssi. Hurry.'
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.6' is activated!]
I took a deep breath and spoke all at once.
"You are unaffected by 'mind attack' from now on!"
<!>[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' receives the effect of 'Incite'!]
<!>[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' is already under the effect of 'incite'!]
<!>[The effect of 'Incite' is multiplied and the penalty is raised!]
<!>[The duration of 'Incite' is extremely short!]
Jung Heewon, who vomited blood from her mouth, swung her sword forward again.
The mental attacks from the Theater’s Owner couldn't bother her any more.
"It's amazing, can you do something like this with 'Incite'?"
Han Sooyoung said while blocking Jung Heewon's sword with her left hand wrapped in [Black Flame].
"But this is how Jung Heewon dies, you know?"
Jung HeeWon, whose complexion turned pale, growled.
"I'm not dying."
Perhaps realizing that she couldn't approach the Theater’s Owner without dealing with Han Sooyoung, Jung Heewon's [Kendo] twisted its trajectory.
<!>[Judgment Time poured out explosive fighting power in a short period of time. In addition, Kendo, which had risen, had been added.]
Her swordsmanship, which cuts the level 7 monsters in an instant, launched an all-out offensive at Han Sooyoung.
"Look at this"
It's good that Han Sooyoung was pushed away for a moment by that non-stop offensive.
I ran quickly and shouted. I’m
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.6' is activated!]
"Turn into 'Broken Faith'!"
Along with my words, 'Thoughts of almost everything' emitted a bright light and formed the shape of a sword. It was the mimicry form obtained when defeating the script writer.
<!>['Thoughts of almost everything' mimics Broken Faith (mass production type)!]
Before I knew it, the simulation was right in front of me.
Han Sooyoung, who found me belatedly, narrowed her eyes.
"I-"
'Broken Faith''s special option was 'Blade of Faith'.
But I didn't have strong qigong skills, so I couldn't use 'Blade of Faith'.
If it was before, it would have been the case.
I raised the mana of my whole body and focused it on my broken faith.
<&>「"Please save my brother."」
It is a skill that Literature Girl 64 passed on to me.
<!>[Activates the exclusive skill 'White Blue Steel Lv.1'!]
<!>[Activates 'Blade of Faith'!]
The ether blade moved, scattering dazzling white light, and the Theater Owner reflexively crouched.
With a bright flash, both arms of the Theater Owner flew in the air.
I continued to wield my sword while reciting an incantation.
<!>[Activates the exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.6'!]
"… am Yoo Jonghyuk."
The moment the trail of the sword finally reached the neck of the Theater Owner, someone pulled my back strongly.
When were they summoned?
Two of Han Sooyoung's [avatars] were holding onto my shoulders. What followed was a strong jolt in my side and shin. The blade flew through the air in an instant, and I knelt on the floor.
When I sat down with dizziness, I saw Jung Heewon, who vomited blood from her mouth, also lose consciousness and pass out.
<!>['Incite'’s effect ends.]
An enormous recoil engulfed Jung Heewon's entire body.
"It was a failure." She said.
Despite fighting against her strong limitations, it was not enough to defeat Han Sooyoung.
Han Sooyoung let out a light sigh and said.
"It was a little dangerous."
I realized how big the difference between her and my capabilities was.
Feeling her victory, Han Sooyoung looked down at me and said.
"Now you know the difference, right?"
I knew from the beginning.
I probably won't be able to beat Han Sooyoung even if a truck comes.
So I thought.
"It doesn't have to be me who wins."
An enormous reverberation felt from behind. Han Sooyoung, her eyes wide open, looked behind me.
A man in a black coat was waking up from a deep depression.
"The person who ends the story is the protagonist of this story."
<!>['Incite'’s effect activates!]
<&>「"You are Yoo Jonghyuk."」
The effect of [Incite], which was used while cutting off the arms of the Theater Owner, was now gone.
Yoo Jonghyuk started running. He didn't seem to be completely out of 'regressive depression' yet, but he seemed to know what he had to do.
The spear held in his hand drew destructive magic in a straight line.
Han Sooyoung, in a hurry, pulled out her sword for the first time.
I admired the pure white sword in her hand.
Han Sooyoung also made that.
'Unbreakable Faith.'
I don't know how it was made.
However, unlike me, her sword was neither mass-produced nor fake, but real.
The moment I saw the dazzling brilliance of the sword, I shuddered.
<&>「The author of this story is also Han Sooyoung.」
Perhaps I will never become a writer like her in my whole life.
I let go of the [Avatar] that was holding me back, exploding my whole body's mana. Then, holding onto the 'Broken Faith' that had fallen on the floor, I ran towards Han Sooyoung.
Han Sooyoung, who was facing Yoo Jonghyuk’s sword, looked back at me in surprise.
"Did I ask you to convince me?"
The two blades of faith collided fiercely.
"Are you ready to be persuaded?"
Han Sooyoung's eyes shook.
Yoo Jonghyuk’s new type, who did not miss the opportunity, leisurely passed by us and moved to end the Theater Owner.
Tsutsutsutsutsutsutsu!
Embarrassed, Han Sooyoung shouted at me.
If it was usual, Han Sooyoung would be able to shake me off and stand her ground.
It would have been.
But this time it was impossible.
<&>「Because this is such a story.」
Han Sooyoung finally realized what was going on.
"You, please."
Perhaps my role in this story is, at best, a bridge.
"If you're a writer, you'd know."
But even that was enough.
If only one more reader could survive. If they can see the end of the story after going through the 'main story' and the 'side stories'.
"You're not trying to finish the story, you're giving up."
I am willing to be broken to complete this story.
Han Sooyoung's 'unbreakable faith' vomited black salt, and I desperately blocked her path.
The blade of 'Broken Faith' crumbled helplessly, and soon I felt the Blade of Faith disappear.
<&>「There is no such thing as one magic sentence that will convince someone.」
Like a writer refining the end of a pre-determined story, I smiled at Han Sooyoung.
<&>「Because all miracles require the price of probability.」
The sound of Yoo Jonghyuk’s spear piercing the head of the Theater’s Owner was heard.
Suddenly, Kim Dokja's face came to mind.
Is that guy still reading this story?
Come to think of it, I always envied him.
<&>「Then, did I get a little closer to him?」
<!>[Succeeded in reproducing the scene.]
The moment the sharp blade pierced my chest, I remembered one thing I had forgotten.
<&>「Tell that guy.」
I managed to get my hands into my pockets, but my arms weren't strong.
In the distance, the Theater’s Owner disappeared, and Yoo Jonghyuk was seen collapsing.
The dome surrounding the rooftop garden was lifted.
<!>[Someone has cleared the theater dungeon.]
My vision was blurred.
My heart grew colder and my whole body lost strength. I just fell to the floor.
The sound of Han Sooyoung shouting something came like an echo.
<&>「The readers died and became 'kkomas Kim Dokja'.」
In the slowly fading consciousness, I saw the scenery of the night sky.
<&>「Then what will I become after I die?」
What came to my mind at the last moment was, unexpectedly, the last sentence of my debut work.
<&>「He walked towards his origin like that.」
I closed my eyes, holding the item in my pocket that I couldn't deliver.
There seemed to be a lemon scent somewhere.
