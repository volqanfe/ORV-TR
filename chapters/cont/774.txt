<title>774 Episode 34 Sibling (5)
I turned my head to follow Yoo Jonghyuk’s gaze.
What was there was the master of the spear, and my incarnation body hanging out, bleeding profusely, with my stomach pierced by the spear.
I couldn't tell if Yoo Jonghyuk was looking at the spear master, Wolgeuk, or my incarnation body.
"You."
One thing is certain: Yoo Jonghyuk is very angry right now.
Anger at the fact that the demon dared to steal his equipment. Or anger at the guy who hurt me when I was still worth using.
I screamed reflexively as I saw Yoo Jonghyuk immediately lashing out.
"Yoo Jonghyuk!"
The level of aggression this guy gave was unusual.
<!>['Restraint of Truth' is activated.]
<!>[Some of the memories of the character 'Yoo Jonghyuk' are sealed.]
<!>[All comprehensive abilities of the character 'Yoo Jonghyuk' temporarily exceed the scenario limit standards!]
<!>[Explosive power surges from the whole body of the character 'Yoo Jonghyuk'!]
You’re activating [Story Engraving] right away like this?
The first story imprint, 'Restraint of Truth', is an imprint that seals part of the memory with its use itself. 
What kind of memory did he lose again this time?
"Yoo Jonghyuk! Hey, you bastard!"
Yoo Jonghyuk didn't even look in this direction, probably because he didn't notice that I was possessing Jung Heewon's body.
A cotton spear was held in the man's hand, and profound magical power was.concentrated in that spear.
The 'Spear Master', who instinctively felt threatened, burst out in anger.
<!>[This guy!]
The magic that shot out like a beam of light left a dark mark in the air.
The 'Spear Master' staggered and parried Yoo Jonghyuk’s blow. His expression changed, as if he was surprised by the heaviness of his magical power.
<!>[I have been  amazed many times today.]
The spear master also released his factory weapon and started stabbing.
The seedling that he had faithfully worked on for hundreds of years was poured out through Wolgeuk.
Kuddddddd!
Despite the storm of stabbings that surged in like waves, Yoo Jonghyuk did not even lift his eyebrows.
The [Eye of the Sage] shone in golden color.
The eyes of the guy who had already reached the peak destroyed the magical power composition of the pouring stab.
"Is this Jinjueonga’s style?"
The startled spear master narrowed his eyes and answered.
<!>[Someone was exterminated. This is just my style.]
"Someone’s style resembles the movement of waves."
Yoo Jonghyuk rode the waves created by the demon's magic power. Some waves were broken and evaded, while others were avoided by twisting his body. He calmly moved forward step by step amidst the barrage of stabs with no way to avoid it.
"I once heard a story about a master from a certain family who sold his family’s martial arts skills."
The spear master did not respond and continued thrusting. A quick, heavy thrust. But none of them reached Yoo Jonghyuk.
In short, it was a technical limitation. The limit of technology that can be developed under the limited category of 'class'.
Nevertheless, his stab failed to hit Yoo Jonghyuk. It was proof that Yoo Jonghyuk's martial arts skill level was higher.
"Is this the only level you have reached after putting aside your family and skills?"
<!>[I am the 'spear master'!]
Finally, the spear master could not stand it anymore and growled.
<!>[I practiced the spear longer than anyone else and received admiration as a reward for my efforts. This <Star Stream> recognized me. I am the 'King of Spears' of the <Star Stream>!]
"King of Spears? It looks like you haven’t met the 'ancestor of mankind' yet."
The progenitor of mankind. I also remembered that constellation.
Among the constellations that Yoo Jonghyuk fought, the constellation that used weapons the best.
"I’m sick of people calling themselves 'kings'."
There was deep darkness in the voice that came out.
"The Sword King, the Apprentice, the King of Fighters, the Emperor of Fist… they were guys who trained for hundreds of years on the time fault of the dark dimension. They were funny guys who threatened to cut off the heads of the constellations someday."
Every time a constellation title was mentioned, the 'Spear Master's' expression changed.
<!>[W-what nonsense are you talking about? How did you get their names—]
"You are the worst of them all."
With a thudding sound, the spear master's new form was pushed away. He was crying and blood was pouring out. He had suffered great damage from the previous blow.
The spear master glared at Yoo Joonghyuk in disbelief.
<!>[That can’t be possible. That can't be possible.]
As Yoo Jonghyuk took a step closer, the spear master also took a step back.
<!>[I am the master of spears! Having practiced only one spear for hundreds of years—]
"Only a few hundred years."
The spear master’s shoulders shook as if he couldn't understand the indifferent voice.
<!>[You… Who on earth are you?]
"A human who has been cultivating for a little longer than hundreds of years."
<!>[Bullshit-]
A rough, bouncing sibilant sound. The two changgeuks tied together swirled and emitted magical power.
The spear master did not know how long Yoo Jonghyuk had lived. He had no idea what time or what round he endured to get here.
Still, he felt it instinctively. The being in front of him is a monster. It is pitch-black darkness that cannot be illuminated by the light of the stars(?).
<!>[The constellation 'Spear Master' opens up the ranks!]
<!>[The Bureau warns the 'Spear Master'.]
He was afraid of the unknown that the darkness held.
<!>[The constellation’s status as 'Spear Master' exceeds the scenario’s probability limit!]
<!>[Some constellations are starting to take interest in the battle.]
So the 'Spear Master' decided.
Even if it means breaking the rules of the scenario, he decided to kill the monster growing before his eyes with his own hands.
<!>[I'm glad I met you now.]
The whole body of the 'Spear Master' who withstood the probability was hit by a storm.
<!>[I will tear you to pieces and kill you before you grow any further.]
The two weapons collided and a loud noise erupted again.
I called out to Yoo Jonghyuk amidst the exploding dust.
"Yoo Jonghyuk!"
It cannot be done. If we fight here now, Yoo Jonghyuk will lose. Even if Yoo Jonghyuk was ahead in terms of skill and proficiency, the opponent was a 'constellation' anyway.
Kuddddddd!
To put my worries to naught, Yoo Jonghyuk was fighting well.
Jinjueonga's style and Yoo Jonghyuk's Breaking the Sky intertwined, brightening the night sky.
It is truly a battle of the Baek Middle Ages.
Even though I thought about helping Yoo Jonghyuk, I couldn't take my eyes off the dazzling battlefield.
<!>[The constellation 'Reclining Dragon' watches the battle.]
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' watches Yoo Jonghyuk’s battle.]
<!>[Some constellations expect this battle to never end.]
The 'Spear Master' is a being of the highest rank among great-grade. Jung Heewon, who opened the first stage of Transcendents, was also a strong opponent who was no match for him.
However, Yoo Jonghyuk was equal in strength with the 'Spear Master', with only one story engraving activated.
<&>「In that short period of time, Yoo Joonghyuk grew again.」
I realize once again that that person is Yoo Jonghyuk.
He is the protagonist of 『Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World』 and the embodiment of the strongest person on earth.
And this damned world was a place where a person with overwhelming talent could not see the true end even if he regressed thousands of times.
Crumble.
The balance of the battle was lost, and blood began to spurt from Yoo Jonghyuk's shoulders and thighs.
<!>[Hahahahaha—What a pity!]
The Spear Master smiled happily.
Looking at Yoo Jonghyuk's expression hardening, I quickly realized what the problem was.
His spear was swinging as if it would break at any moment.
I used all my remaining strength to lift up Jung Heewon's body. And then jumped into the battlefield.
A sharp crash of waves that surrounds the entire body.
<!>[This is a distraction.]
The lightly surging waves blew away the body of Jung Heewon, who was rushing towards him.
Even though I was hit and bounced by the waves, I did not lose my sanity. Because starting now was important.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is unlocke²d!]
While the Spear Master focused his attention on Jung Heewon, I woke up to my original body. A distant pain surged from my side where there was a hole, but I gritted my teeth and endured it.
I immediately took out the sword from my pocket and threw it at Yoo Jonghyuk.
"Yoo Jonghyuk!"
The sword that flew rapidly along the [Way of the Wind] was held in Yoo Jonghyuk's right hand.
Although it was not a holy sword like the 'Raybringer', it was a weapon that could exert as much power as a holy sword, at least against demons.
'Unbreakable faith'.
Yoo Jonghyuk immediately infused magic into 'Unbreakable Faith'.
<!>[Activates 'Blade of Faith'.]
<!>[The special option of 'Unbreakable Faith' is activated.]
<!>[Ether attribute is converted to 'Divinity'.]
Yoo Jonghyuk's ether blade, converted to divine properties, traced a trajectory.
The left arm of the 'Spear Master' flies like a hallucination.
The astonished 'Spear Master' testified.
<!>[You, that sword  is—]
Yoo Jonghyuk stormed out without giving him any time to rest. Yoo Jonghyuk's rebellious swordsmanship, which had great synergy with the 'Blade of Faith', turned the wave of the 'Spear Master' into tatters.
Originally, this would have been impossible due to the difference in status, but in this 'scenario', it was different.
The demons of this forest were designed to take enormous damage from 'holy attribute' items.
<!>[Kaaaaaaat—]
Nevertheless, the Spear Master resisted until the end.
Red and white magic collided, creating a massive explosion.
While holding Jung Heewon in my arms, I reflexively rolled around on the floor.
The entire forest became incandescent and the aftereffects of the magic wave exploded.
A warm feeling passed through the back of my head.
After a while, I raised my head and looked at the epicenter of the explosion. Yoo Jonghyuk, now in tatters, was catching his breath with his sword stuck on the floor.
The incarnation body of the 'Spear Master' standing opposite was not visible. Only the 'Wolgeuk' stuck on the floor was trembling as if it recognized its true owner.
<!>[The constellation 'Spear Master' suffered a terrible blow and left the scenario.]
Yoo Jonghyuk won.
<!>[High-level demon 'Spear Master' has been defeated!]
<!>[You have become a major contributor to the scenario!]
<!>[You can obtain additional rewards when you finally clear the scenario.]
<!>[The new story that is germinating is influenced by your achievements.]
Yoo Jonghyuk grabbed his Wolgeuk that had fallen on the floor and turned to me.
"You were alive?"
"Did you wish I were dead?"
I answered with a grin.
But to be honest, I felt like I was going to die soon. There was so much blood flowing from my pierced side. I blinked as if I was about to faint at any moment.
Yoo Jonghyuk stared at me with one of his eyes, as if he didn't like me, and took out a golden pill from his arms and threw it.
He then sat down next to me and shifted into his lotus position.
"To defeat the great demons, we need to save up our strength. Because of you, we wasted unnecessary strength."
I was dumbfounded by the one-sided notice, and then belatedly looked down at the pill that Yoo Jonghyuk had given me.
And after a while.
I was so startled that my eyes narrowed.
Oh my god, this is a 'Daehwandan'.
What is Daehwandan?
The greatest martial arts guru who can gain a double amount of magical power by eating just one pill, only gave up such a treasure for recovery purposes?
This bastard. Are you a good guy?
I shook my head at the foolish thought that suddenly occurred to me.
This guy isn't a bad guy, but he's not a good guy either.
It just means that Yoo Jonghyuk is also desperate for this scenario.
I split the Daehwandan and ate half, and fed the other half to Jung Heewon, who had collapsed.
Jung Heewon who was convulsing due to the side effects of [Madness] gradually began to stabilize when the effect of 'Daehwandan' took effect.
I managed to take a breather, but I couldn't say that the situation was good at all. Above all, the number of people unable to move increased by two.
—Writer!
A welcome message came just in time.
—Sorry. I tried to help right away, but I was also held back...
Ji Eunyu, who stuck her head out between the long bushes, was covered in dust all over. Judging by the thin cuts on her arms and legs, it appears that there were more demons remaining in the area.
I waved my hand, thinking it was okay.
Ji Eunyu opened her mouth first, as if she knew what I was going to say.
"Don’t say anything. Just stay."
"…"
"You saw what kind of people they were. There were three more high-level demons like that. No, there may have been more than that."
There are three high-level demons who chased after Goo Seonah and <Kim Dokja Company>. Even if there was only one monster like the 'Spear Master' involved, the situation would not be good.
"We can’t let them die."
"I know. But—"
Thanks to taking 'Daehwandan', the wound on my side healed quickly. There was no problem in moving my body right away.
"I know that Seonah-ssi is hostile towards me. Still, shouldn’t we talk? If there are any misunderstandings, we should resolve them."
"What if she’s not someone you can talk to? What if Goo Seonah is an unexpected villain?"
I looked at Ji Eunyu without answering. Ji Eunyu must have sensed my gaze and also closed her mouth.
Sometimes silence creates deeper understanding than a hundred words of explanation. This is especially true for Ji Eunyu and me.
Because we are people who created the same work.
She is the one who understands what I left behind better than anyone else. Even if I don't write it down, she will already know what I'm going to say.
And she probably knows better than anyone else that that sentence can never be modified.
Ji Eunyu lowered her head and spoke in a low voice.
"Ha... Is this how you feel, Yoo Sangah?"
"I’ll be back soon, so please stay here. Please take care of the two of them."
"If anything happens, I will run away alone, so please come back quickly."
With a bitter smile, I glanced at Yoo Jonghyuk, who was having a good luck breakfast, and Jung Heewon, who had fainted, and immediately started running along the forest path.
There were traces of Goo Seonah and her group all over the grass, as well as the flags of the high-ranking demons who chased them.
A powerful energy was felt not far away. My heart was pounding. A somewhat familiar vibe.
I knew someone with a similar energy.
'The Demon King of Salvation'.
Although it was a little foreign, it definitely felt similar to my sponsor.
Maybe there is Kim Dokja around here?
When I finally made my way through the grass, I found the bodies of fallen high-level demons.
The corpses of demons were horribly torn apart.
When I slowly raised my head, I made eye contact with someone  standing across the grass looking at me.
My brother, who looked exactly like me, was standing there.
