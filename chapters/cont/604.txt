<title>604 Episode 10. Writer (5)
It was then that a sharp dagger flew from among the grass.
Jung Heewon, whose complexion changed, pulled out her sword, and I reflexively lowered my back.
The dagger that had missed us by a narrow margin became lodged in a tree.
"I didn't expect you to come all this way already."
Three men and a woman appeared in the dense rainforest.
“Broken Faith” and a white coat.
It was an outfit that made me laugh out loud.
"You are indeed a reader who has read it 100 times."
The Misreading Association’s team of writers.
How did they come faster than us? I thought we were the fastest, but a faint aura swirled around the illegal writer.
<!>[Incarnation, ‘Yeom Ilwoo’, has a proof of receiving the ‘King of Dice’ surname.]
The surname is “King of Dice.”
Apparently, he had the constellation “The King of Gambling” as his sponsor.
Indeed, in that case, it was understandable that he climbed the stage so quickly.
Excluding the illegal writer in the center, the two men and woman were also confirmed by using [Characters List] to confirm the identities of the rest of the gang.
<!>[A large number of people have been browsed and temporarily changed to ‘Character Summary’.]

[Character Summary]
Name: Kim Jeonhwa
Sponsor: Plague-Bringing Rat
Exclusive Attribute: Ratman (Rare)
Overall stats: [Physique Lv.18], [Strength Lv.16], [Agility Lv. 11], [Magic Power Lv.6]

Both were alien species.
On the one hand, ratman, a member of the family of the “Plague-Bringing Rat,” whom I had dealt with before.
The other is a lizardman, a member of the tail-cutting serpent's family…
Looking at the situation, it was highly likely that the tail-cutting snake was a constellation on the side of the Misreading Association.
I lightly raised both hands.
"Wait. Do we need to fight among ourselves?"
Half of it was sincere.
The last time I met the Misreading Association was when a reader possessed a constellation, and what I killed was his incarnation, a “character.”
However, the member of the Misreading Association I have to deal with this time is a person who possesses a character. No matter how criminal he is for producing and distributing illegal texts, anyway, he is a person from the same reality as me.
I couldn't be comfortable with him being killed by my hands.
Above all, I thought that the punishment for his wrongdoing had to be paid in reality, not in fiction.
Whatever he thought of my words, the guy smiled mischievously.
"That's right. I don't have to fight with the reader who read my novel."
Still brazen.
Thinking about it, I think it would be okay if I just let them pay for their sins here.
"But a reader who has read it 100 times is a bit scary for me."
With a cool tone, the text writer sent a signal.
The two men and woman on both sides threw five or six daggers from their arms.
It looks like we were attacked like that before.
Looking at the blade flying with a clear killing force, I belatedly recalled Killer King's warning.
<&>「"The members of the 'Misreading Association' deserve to die."」
I felt like I knew a little bit why he was so terrified.
As Jung Heewon slashed the flying dagger, the dagger was stuck in the floor oxidized while exhaling black smoke.
The floor in contact with the ammunition turned black. It was poison.
"Be careful! You can't even touch it!"
Last time it was a poison bomb, this time it was poison on weapons.
Tchiiit.
Jeong Heewon's poisoned knife was melting.
"Heewon-ssi!"
I threw the extra knife I had at Jung Heewon. Jung Heewon who received it well raised her sword with both hands and turned toward the front.
A sword wind blew in front of her eyes, and the trajectories of the additional daggers that flew were all broken.
Perhaps feeling that the situation was not going well, the script writer also jumped into battle.
<!>[Incarnation, 'Yeom Ilwoo', activates 'Moonlight Steps Lv. 2’!]
The moonlight steps.
He was running while stepping on the steps with a pretty plausible name, but judging from his movements, his average ability was lower than mine.
The guy who rushed leaving a brilliant light every time was a god who was tamed with hot water.
I hit “Broken Faith” forcefully.
"Change into 'Old Iron Shield'."
At the same time as my command, “Thoughts of Almost Everything” changed into the shape of a shield.
Kagagagak!
The blade bounced off.
The text writer muttered in a surprised voice.
"It's a mysterious item."
The moment I made contact with his knife, a message came through “Thoughts of Almost Everything”.
<!>[The target analysis begins.]
<!>[Item analysis complete!]
<!>[The item is Broken Faith (mass production type).]
<!>[The item's grade is D.]
<!>[The item is rated low.]
<!>[Obtain the mimicry form of the item.]
What is it? “Broken Faith” is not real, but “mass-produced”?
Apparently, the mass-produced knife was no longer usable.
The durability of “Broken Faith” ran out due to the ”Blade of Faith” being activated in front of the readers before.
Perhaps the “Blade of Faith” can't be activated anymore.
The text book writer smiled brightly.
"If I did, would I die?"
A small pot was held by the text writer's side.
<!>['Yongjun' demonstrates the mysterious power of regeneration.]
The Pot of Regeneration, Yongjun.
This time I couldn't help but be surprised.
<!>[D-class item, 'Lesser Leather Greaves', has disappeared as a sacrifice.]
<!>[D-class item Broken Faith (mass production type)'s durability has been regenerated.]
<!>[Broken Faith (mass production type) responds to strong will!]
<!>[‘Blade of Faith', is activated!]
Tchiiing!
A blue ether blade grew from the sword that touched the shield.
Almost reflexively, I dropped my shield and stepped back.
<!>[The mimicry form of 'Old Iron Shield' has been destroyed!]
Both sides almost flew away.
As if he was already confident of winning, he let out a relaxed smile.
"Did you not know how to use this?"
Yongjun is a reward item that can be obtained at the National Altitude Area Museum. It was an item that could never be obtained in the current scenario.
Except in one way.
"It seems that your sponsor spent quite a bit of coins."
"My sponsor is a bit rich."
Towards the script writer who smiled confidently, I replied with a grin.
"How amazing. I don't think that kind of information was written on the illegal text."
The script writer's expression hardened. In the mass-produced “Broken Faith” swordplay, powerful etheric blades began to rage.
I hurriedly avoided the blade and carefully examined his skills.
<!>[Incarnation, 'Yeom Ilwoo', is activating 'Wolyeong River Lv.1'!]
"Looking at it now, it isn't even the [White and Blue Steel]."
I expected that.
The last stock of white and blue steel was already bought by Killer King's younger sister.
The enraged text writer screamed and swung his sword.
<!>[Incarnation, ‘Yeom Ilwoo’, activates 'Wolyeong Sword Technique Lv.2'!]
<!>[Incarnation, 'Yeom Ilwoo', activates 'Weapon Improvement Lv.2'!]
[Weapon Improvement], [Wolyeong Sword Technique], and [Wolyeong River] were all skills that could be acquired in the early stages.
<&>「But with that level of proficiency, it's worth fighting for.」
Along with the dazzling light, the “Thoughts of Almost Everything” had turned into a bamboo pole.
When “Blade of Faith” collided with the bamboo pole and went away with a metal sound, the script writer opened his eyes.
Of course I knew that my weapon would be cut off. “Ether Blade” in the beginning is that powerful.
But that's for a low-level item, and this is a star relic.
<!>[The constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', nods happily.]
The man bit his lip hard and swung his sword right away.
Kagagakak!
The blade and the bamboo pole collided, making a sharp scraping sound.
Contrary to the fact that he was quite talkative, his combat sense was not very good.
Even though he has [Wolyeong River], [Wolyeong Sword Technique], and [Weapon Improvement], he doesn't have the slightest advantage over me.
<!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' admires the poor sword fighting.]
It was natural.
This guy must have been killing enemies in one blow with the one-tool “Blade of Faith.”
<!>[The constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', advises that you should not pour in support from the beginning because of this.]
<!>[The constellation, 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger', clicks his tongue and nods.]
The durability of “Broken Faith” ran out before I knew it, and “Blade of Faith” was broken.
I swung the bamboo stick at the guy's side without missing a chance. He narrowly escaped, but the hem of his coat was torn and flesh peeled off his side.
<!>[The constellation, 'The King of Gambling', is disappointed with his incarnation!]
<!>[The constellation who has not yet revealed his modifier advises you to choose your hand carefully from now on.]
He hurriedly backed away, holding back a high-pitched scream.
“What are you doing! Stop watching and help quickly!"
Along with his cry, the ratman and lizardman that Jung Heewon was dealing with began to react abnormally.
<!>[The constellation, 'Plague-Bringing Rat', increases the synchronization rate with its incarnation.]
<!>[The constellation, 'Snake That Cut Off Its Tail', increases the synchronization rate with its incarnation.]
Jung Heewon, who was gradually gaining an advantage with the combo of [Ghost Killing] and [Kendo], closed her eyes.
Tsutsutsutsutsutsutsu!
Blue sparks covered the alien species.
The demonic energy of the alien species, which had been around the 9th level before, had risen to the level of a level 7 monster.
<!>[Incarnation, 'Hamin', activates 'Cursed Dagger'!]
<!>[Incarnation, 'Kim Jeonhwa', activates stigma' and accelerated attack'!]
Dozens of daggers fell like a waterfall from the arms of the two aliens.
Jung Heewon avoided the weapons with light movements.
But this time something was different.
<!>[The special effect of 'Cursed Dagger' is activated!]
I suddenly recalled the effects of [Cursed Dagger].
"Heewon-ssi! Stop it this time!"
The [Cursed Dagger] is a stigma that, if you miss 20 dagger hits, you can definitely be hit by the “next one.”
A black dagger that followed Jung Heewon's movements finally reached her nose.
Jung Heewon swung her sword and slashed it. With the sound of metal, the dagger's blade began to melt.
"Aaaaaaa!"
Jung Jaewoo, who was hiding nearby, screamed as he saw the melted knife.
Jung Heewon, who grabbed Jung Jaewoo by the back, quickly retreated towards me.
"Inho-ssi."
I nodded in agreement.
If this is the case, there is no chance of winning.
Weapons are also weapons, but on the other side, two constellations clung to each other and divided their ranks.
"Jaewoo-ssi, do you have any hidden skills?"
Jung Jaewoo shook his head.
It must be difficult to trust the [Little Luck] this time as well. Because that's literally 'a little bit of luck'.
“Heewon-ssi.”
Jung Heewon nodded.
I gave Jung Heewon 'Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick' that I was holding and said, "Please lend me your ear for a moment."
I didn't want to use this skill on Jung Heewon. But now there was no other way.
The text writer shouted as if he felt something strange.
"Kill them! Quickly!"
The aliens, whose bodies had more than doubled in size, roared and charged.
Aliens are not “humans.”
Then can you say that they are “monsters”?
I don't know. But what is certain is, "Every enemy you see in front of you from now on."
That it will be like that from now on.
"It's a monster."
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.6', is activated!]
The ratman swung his claws that had grown long, and the lizardman swung his tail, aiming for Jung Heewon's back.
And.
<!>[Incarnation, ‘Jung Heewon’, activates ‘Judgment Time’.]
Sparks lit up in Jung Heewon's eyes.
<!>[The constellation, ‘Maritime War God’, doubts his own eyes.]
<!>[The constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', admires the descendant's swordsmanship.]
<!>[The constellation, ‘Abyssal Black Flame Dragon’ asks if the probability is okay.]
What was happening, I couldn't even track it with my naked eyes.
Amidst the rising dust, terrifying cracking sounds resounded in succession.
A flash of light soared with the sound of an explosion, and the severed lizardman's tail and ratman's arm rolled outside the dust.
Less than a minute later, a series of loud banging sounds came from the cloud of dust.
As the dust slowly subsided, only one person's shadow stood there.
I saw the corpses of the ratman and the lizardman torn apart.
It was expected, but the result was more than expected.
<!>[The constellation, 'Plague-Bringing Rat', vomits blood and exits the channel.]
<!>[The constellation, 'Snake That Cut Off Its Tail', cuts its tail to avoid the probability aftermath!]
<!>[The constellation 'Snake That Cut Off Its Tail', stares dumbfoundedly at 'Jung Heewon'.]
Realizing that the battle was unfavorable towards him, the script writer had already broken through the rain forest.
He was just running away.
Jung Heewon picked up one of the dead ratman's daggers and threw it at him.
Whee-a-a-a-aek!
The weapon flew like a bullet and grazed the guy's shoulder.
"Aaaaaaaaaaagh!?"
He screamed and fled through the rain forest.
I couldn't miss him like this.
He is a man who does not hesitate to stab people. Here, he must definitely stop breathing.
At that time, Jung Heewon fell forward. I could see the aura of judgment that had spread over her whole body fade rapidly.
"Heewon-ssi!"
<!>['Incite'’s effect has disappeared.]
<!>['Judgment Time' is canceled.]
I hurriedly supported Jung Heewon.
There was no abnormality in her breathing or pulse. However, looking at the nosebleed, it seemed that the aftermath of [Incite] was strong.
"I’ll finish him and come back!"
Seeing the situation, Jung Jaewoo jumped up and ran out, probably gathering his courage.
I shouted while carrying Jung Heewon.
"Wait a minute! Jaewoo-ssi!"
Soon, Jung Jaewoo disappeared into the rainforest in pursuit of the script writer.
Anxiety overtook me.
I followed the footsteps of Jung Jaewoo with Jung Heewon on my back.
Several times in the distance, piercing sounds rang out, and screams were heard. I continued to run after the source of the sound.
And… damn it.
"Jaewoo-ssi!"
Jung Jaewoo was lying between the trees.
<!>[A constellation that has not yet revealed their modifier makes a sad face.]
I breathed in lightly and approached Jung Jaewoo.
<&>「Jung Jaewoo has a little bit of luck.」
At least, he won't die of poison in a place like this. The wound must have avoided vital points.
Jung Jaewoo let out a moan as if in pain.
"Ugh."
I laid Jung Heewon on the floor and looked at Jung Jaewoo's wounds.
“Hey, Inho-ssi."
Jung Jaewoo was smiling.
"I… I got… a… shot… at him… He… didn’t… get… far…"
"Don't talk."
A dagger was stuck near Jung Jaewoo's heart. Upon checking his wounds, the poison had already spread from his chest, melting his skin and intestines.
The blood that fell on the ground soaked the floor.
"Stay still."
Why are you hurt so badly?
Jung Jaewoo must have had [Little Luck]?
Belatedly, it came to my mind that the script writer was the incarnation of the “King of Gambling.”
If the two people's luck collided with each other, the effect of the attribute was offset.
"Omg…"
Medicines that could cure this wound came to mind.
Elaine Forest Essence?
Too late to use.
Great Healing Elixir?
I checked the dokkaebi’s bag, but it was already out of stock.
Holy oil or something similar?
There was no way to get it now.
<&>「I couldn't think of a way.」
If there was Lee Seolhwa, she would be able to save him. There’s the Life and Death pills she made.
<&>「She isn’t here now.」
The pages of ORV went through my mind.
I wrote many sentences with my own hands. In the sentences I wrote, there must be a way to save this person.
"It’s alright. I can fix this. Don’t worry."
A person is dying right in front of my eyes.
My hands trembled and my head wasn't working well.
I squeezed out the “Elaine Forest Essence” I had and applied it to the wound along with an ointment cream.
In order to avoid the spread of poison, I cut ground rat jerky into small pieces and fed it to him with horn powder from the poisonous rhinoceros.
Jung Jaewoo's throat wriggled and he started coughing up blood.
Jung Jaewoo muttered while crying.
"I don’t want to die."
"You won’t die."
It's a lie. This person is dying.
My breathing was hoarse, and my voice trembled.
"I’ll save you."
Because of me, the reader who read my story was dying.
"I'll save you no matter what."
In the face of his death, all I could say was a lie.
You won't die.
Even if you die, I can definitely save you.
Jung Jaewoo's lips moved. He seemed to be trying to say something, but his voice was muffled.
He seemed to say he shouldn't have read it, and he seemed to resent the person who wrote it.
After a while. His breathing stopped and his pulse stopped.
<!>[Team member, 'Jung Jaewoo', has died.]
I looked down at Jung Jaewoo's face for a long time.
I've definitely seen people die several times.
<&>「Jung Jaewoo is dead.」
Still, I didn't feel it.
Really, I couldn't believe that the person who was alive a moment ago had passed away.
"Jaewoo-ssi."
The moment I grabbed his limp hand, I felt something transparent coming out of his body.
I realized that it was Jung Jaewoo's soul.
He definitely has a soul.
Then I might be able to save him. If we somehow find out where his soul is, then-
Tsutsutsutsutsu.
Sparks flew in the air, and for an instant the outline of the soul thickened.
There was a terrible scream.
A hand snatched his soul in an instant. It disappeared through the torn space and I watched the scene in a daze.
My thoughts didn't flow as if my head was out of order. I didn't quite understand what it was. The only thing I managed to get out of my messed up brain was a single sentence.
If I'm not mistaken, Jung Jaewoo's soul that disappeared must be—
<&>「He was in the form of a kkoma Kim Dokja.」
