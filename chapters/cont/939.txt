<title>939 Episode 55 Giant Tree (5)
The approaching Breaking the Sky Sword Saint—I had a gut feeling the moment I saw her, now an Outer God.
<&>「It’s not as good as Zeus, who descended upon the Fear Realm.」
Not all Constellations classified as 'Myth-grade' are equal. Just as the 'Demon King of Salvation', who had just reached Myth-grade in two days, and the 'Seat of Lightning', were not on equal footing.
<&>「But she’s not an opponent I can face now.」
Even using 'Demon King of Salvation' mode, my maximum output was at the late-stage of Narrative-grade. While there was only a difference between the late-stage of the Narrative-grade and the early-stage of Myth-grade, the scale of their power was on a whole other level.
I looked around and saw Jung Heewon standing frozen, her feet frozen.
<&>「The primal power of the 'Fear'.」
Just as an ordinary human would freeze when confronted by a beast, all beings below Narrative-grade would lose their fighting spirit in the face of a Myth-grade Constellation. Of course, guys as crazy as Yoo Joonghyuk would charge regardless of their opponent's status—
"Heewon-ssi! Come to your senses!"
Jung Heewon didn't budge despite my shout. She must have been overwhelmed by the Mythical status, completely out of her mind.
Damn it.
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was charging toward me.
I quickly closed the distance between us and raised my voice.
"Nameless Fear, reveal your name immediately!"
I didn't know exactly what 'that thing' was disguised as the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. To interpret the Fear, I first needed to identify its source.
<!>[The story, 'Friend of All Narratives', continues singing.]
<&>「All Fears will reveal their names before the throne.」
Is this because I had forcibly unleashed the power of the 'King of Fear'? I felt a shiver run through my body, and dizzying sparks began to course through my veins.
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's pitch-black eyes stared at me.
<#>【Na me】
Those who ask for the name of something are obligated to bear the weight of that name.
<!>[The Constellation, 'First Heavenly Demon', glares.]
<!>[The Constellation, 'Emperor of Power', groans at the power of Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.]
<!>[Many Constellations point out the probability of the scenario!]
The Constellations, belatedly confirming the power of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, flashed a fierce light in the air.
Tsutsutsutsutsutsu!
<!>[The Natural Disaster-level Fear, 'Impossible Chivalry', is looking at you.]
The Impossible Chivalry. That was the name of the Fear into which the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint had evolved.
Faced with that Fear, I opened my mouth again.
"I…!"
There are various ways to interpret Fear when faced with it. You can assimilate into it, or understand it.
"I have not come to harm you!"
Or you can [Incite] Fear.
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.???', activates!]
"Breaking the Sky Sword Saint! Wake up! Don't you know who I am? It's me! Kim End, the youngest of the Transcendent Alliance!"
I roared like a madman at the approaching Fear.
"We fought together, didn't we? In the final scenario of the 40th Round—you were there when the Fear Realm was destroyed!"
My words evaded her like a fish slipping through a coarse net.
In fact, inciting a Fear on the scale of a 'Natural Disaster' was absurd. But there was no other way right now. I had to buy time, no matter what.
Now, less than ten paces remained between Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and me. It was time to take a gamble.
"What will Kyrgios think when he sees this?"
No matter how coarse the net, if you keep casting, something will inevitably get caught.
"How pathetic! This is why they say the world is a paradox! Why do you talk so much!"
For the first time, something resembling emotion flashed across her pitch-black eyes.
I seized the opportunity and continued to babble.
"Remember your disciple! That damned handsome man with your exact style! What would he say if he found out you were fooled by a story and ended up like this!"
Her steps, which had been drawing near, suddenly stopped.
"Do you know why he comes to you every time he regresses? Why, despite so many betrayals, he trusts you? Why does he confide in you alone—"
The moment I spoke, a pitch-black energy began to flow from Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's entire body.
<#>【Yoo Joong hyuk】
"Yes, that's right. Yoo Joonghyuk! If you've come to your senses, you should go slap that damned disciple's ass…"
The moment I met Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's gaze, I realized something.
<&>「This isn't the kind of 'Fear' I can persuade or incite.」
The aura of D-Coins rippled through her body. The coins, made from my brother's flesh and blood, were disrupting my [Incite] and strengthening Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.
<&>「But even if it were Kim Dokja's flesh and blood, is it possible to bestow such powerful power upon an incarnation?」
<&>「Is it even possible to transform a Transcendent into a Mythical Fear?」
Cold sweat ran down my spine.
"Dokja-ssi."
Jung Heewon, just as she regained consciousness, turned to me. I gave her a slight nod and stepped forward.
<#>【Di ? Sci ? Ple】
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, approaching, muttered something incomprehensible as she raised her hand. A sword energy that seemed at least several dozen meters thick was surging from her hand.
<#>【I'm sor ry】
If I get hit by that, I'll die. Even if the Great Demon King of Salvation descends, not the Demon King of Salvation, he can't stop it.
<&>「Therefore, the difficulty of this scenario is clearly abnormal.」
I summoned the 'Unchanging One'.
"Unchanging One! Now is the time!"
There was a reason I was desperately trying to buy some time.
<!>[Many Constellations doubt the probability of this scenario.]
I needed time to describe this absurd situation in even the slightest detail.
Ultimately, the story of this world is driven by the probability of the Constellations.
All scenarios are regulated by the Constellations that watch over them.
<!>[The Constellation, 'First Heavenly Demon', agrees with the unfairness of the scenario.]
<!>[The Constellation, 'Emperor of Power', agrees with the unfairness of the scenario.]
Of course, the reason they were pointing out the probability wasn't simply because of the scenario's difficulty.
<!>[The Constellation, 'Omnipotent Sun', declares that a mere human could never attain the level of Myth.]
<!>[The Constellation, 'Blacksmith of the Volcano', shakes its head.]
<!>[The Constellation, 'God King of Thunder', says a mere half-breed of a giant is...]
They simply cannot tolerate a mere mortal daring to claim a higher status than themselves.
<!>[The Constellation, 'One Who Draws the Boundaries of the Seas', expresses strong displeasure.]
The next moment, sparks flew through the air, and the record of the Constellations' approval gained momentum.
The probability of the <Star Stream> finally began to shift.
Those who manage this world's scenarios are the ones who make that probability a reality.
<@>[Huh, the appearance of a Myth-grade Outer God! How did the Murim incarnations come to face such a great ordeal?]
A Dokkaebi.
<@>[Simple, one-sided academic discussions are no fun. Okay, shall we impose some rules?]
A message floated into the air, accompanied by a seemingly joyful, intangible voice.
<!>[A new sub-scenario has been created!]
Asking the name of the Fear, asking questions to buy time, gathering the Constellations, and completing the records to persuade them.
All of this preparation was solely to reach this moment.
<!>[The sub-scenario has arrived!]
+
<Sub-scenario — Defeating Fear>
Category: Main
Difficulty: ???
Clear Conditions: Defeat the Natural Disaster-level Fear, '■■■■ ■■'.
Time Limit: —
Reward: ???
Failure: The destruction of Murim
+
The scenario came down like an emergency order.
The content was simple:
Defeat Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, who had become an Outer God.
Looking at the scenario alone, the situation didn't seem to have changed much, but from my perspective, things were a little different.
<&>「Every scenario has a 'strategy'.」
The fact that 'Fear' has become a scenario means at least a feasible 'strategy' has been created.
As the scenario was created, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint paused for a moment, and I exchanged glances with Jung Heewon.
'Heewon-ssi.'
Jung Heewon replied.
'Are you sure?'
I nodded.
And then, as if we had agreed in advance, we started running.
<&>「Even if Breaking the Sky Sword Saint absorbed D-Coins, there's no way she could cross the 'mythical' boundary so easily.」
This scenario is based on the records I relayed to the 'Unchangeable One'. In other words, this scenario exists to explain Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's 'unreasonable strength'.
The moment Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's slowly moving eyes fixed on me, I pointed into the air and shouted.
"Yoo Joonghyuk!"
Of course, Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't there. Fortunately, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, whose intelligence had been slightly diminished, followed my finger and stared blankly into space.
<&>「Perhaps Breaking the Sky Sword Saint is exerting mythical power under a few constraints.」
I stared at the pitch-black bush where Breaking the Sky Sword Saint had first appeared.
"Over there!"
<&>「In other words, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's strength is only effective within this forest.」
Perhaps, deep within this forest, something that gave rise to the 'Myth-grade Breaking the Sky Sword Saint' must be hidden.
And of course, the place it was hidden was—
<&>「The place guarded by the 'Impossible Chivalry'.」
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's sword moved. A strike reminiscent of Zeus or Odin's thunderbolt, a strike that would shatter the heavens.
"Now!"
The moment the lightning struck, we were thrust into the pitch-black bushes by a hair's breadth.
We staggered to our feet, a pain that felt like our bodies were being crushed.
"This isn't the end. They'll catch up soon."
Before Breaking the Sky Sword Saint could find us, we first had to understand this forest.
<!>[You have entered 'Myeonggyeongmok.']
However, the moment we were confronted with the spectacle before us, both Jung Heewon and I were momentarily lost in our own minds.
Myeonggyeongmok.
It referred to the titanic ability to read others' emotions. But what unfolded before our eyes were not eyes.
What unfolded before our eyes—
<&>「How far can one person's universe extend?」
A gigantic tree, its size almost beyond comprehension.
"Ah..."
The tree, stretching toward distant galaxies, branched into dozens of branches, covering the sky.
The moment I reached out to the tree, a story spoke to me.
<&>「"What a handsome fellow. What's your name?"」
<&>「"Are you saying you wish to learn swordsmanship from me?"」
Only then did I understand what this giant tree was. It was Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's annual rings. It was the sum total of the history she had built while reigning as the god of Murim.
Jung Heewon muttered, unable to hide her awe.
"So this is... Master."
"No, not the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint we know."
"Huh?"
Even if she reigned as a deity of Murim for a long time, could the story of one person be this vast?
<&>「The reason she became a 'Natural Disaster-level Fear'.」
I looked up at the sky. Then, the memories clinging to the branches spoke to me.
<&>「That was Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's first death.」
Every branch that reached the sky was etched with her death.
<&>「"Run away, Joonghyuk-ah."」
Some Breaking the Sky Sword Saints died in a combined attack by the returnees.
<&>「"I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise."」
Some Breaking the Sky Sword Saints died fighting the Constellations to protect Yoo Joonghyuk.
<&>「"You can become stronger."」
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was neither a Returnee nor Reincarnated. There was no way Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, living the life of a mere human, could have experienced so many deaths.
<&>「All these deaths are 'recorded' in Yoo Joonghyuk's memories.」
Memories spanning thousands, if not tens of thousands, of years, etched onto the tree twinkled brightly like stars.
<&>「"Master, I have come to see you."」
Every time Yoo Joonghyuk visited Murim, he would come to her and tell her what had happened in the past.
No, to be precise, he didn't even need to tell her. By simply releasing the mental barrier, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint could access Yoo Joonghyuk's history through the [Myeonggyeongmok].
<&>「Only those who regress remember everything.」
Perhaps that statement was false.
There was at least one person, a tree that had endured his years with him.
<&>「The one who had been Yoo Joonghyuk's companion through all those times.」
The master Yoo Joonghyuk trusted more than anyone else, and relied on more than anyone else.
<&>「"There will come a day when I have nothing left to teach you."」
Every time Yoo Joonghyuk returned, this tree would have continued to grow. Hearing of his tragedy, remembering his death.
<&>「"The day will surely come, disciple, when you will become a Transcendent without my help, when I will no longer be needed."」
It would have accumulated rings.
<&>「"But even when that day comes, come to Murim once more. In this forest, to me, who will still remember nothing—"」
The one who listened to his story, grieving the fate of her disciple, who must fight alone against the destruction of the world.
<&>「"Tell me your story again."」
From now on, I must cut her down.
