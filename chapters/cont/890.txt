<title>890 Episode 48 Avatar (13)
A meteor shower was observed.
A rain of stars falling from the sky.
I realized anew how many Constellations there were in the sky of the <Star Stream>.
The Constellations that forced the scenarios on the incarnations, cheered them, laughed at them, mocked them, supported them, saved them, and were saved.
The Constellations were weighing.
I looked up at the scenery she had seen that day in Han Sooyoung's world.
"It begins."
Everything flowed according to Han Sooyoung's will. The Constellations that were blocked from running away from her scheme had no choice but to follow Han Sooyoung's plan.
<&>「First Wave, Lightning.」
One of the representative Constellations of <Asgard> stood against the Lightning Wave.
<@>[I am the Thunder of Thursday!]
Thunder of Thursday, Thor.
<@>[I didn't know I would end up fighting you.]
Indra, the God King of Lightning.
The Constellations of the Narrative-grade that belonged to the Ten-Yo also participated.
<@>[Ooooooooooo!]
'Lightning of Disaster and Harvest', Raijin.
A Japanese Constellation that did not properly appear in the main story.
Kugugugugu!
But those three could not cancel out all the lightning waves.
<@>[We'll join in too!]
The martial artists who learned the martial arts of the electric power system, and the Constellations of the great men also helped.
But despite the cooperation of those Constellations, the lightning wave that spread out mercilessly swept away the universe of the <Star Stream>.
The Constellations were oxidized without even being able to scream.
But there was no time to look back at them.
<&>「Second wave, Flames.」
The flame wave continued without giving them a moment to catch their breath. The Constellations began to retreat in fear at the flame wave that was even larger than the lightning wave.
"Now it's my turn to step forward!"
As Kim Namwoon, who was covered in [Black Flame] all over his body, confidently stepped forward, the Constellations also burst into cheers as if they could not lose.
<@>[Nothing compared to the flames of the volcano!]
The Blacksmith of the Volcano, Hephaestus.
<@>[It is time to choose the strongest flame.]
'Burning Tragedy', Kagutsuchi and 'Wandering Lantern', Jack O'Lantern.
What appeared behind them was the God of Fire whose entire body was engulfed in bright flames.
<@>[I will stop it.]
Agni, the 'Flame of Purification', one of the Locapalas of <Vedas>.
<@>[This time, I cannot miss out.]
Likewise, Surua, the 'God of Supreme Light', one of the Locapalas.
<@>[K, I am pushed back—!]
<@>[Kuaaaaaaaah!]
Even so, the total amount of power was insufficient. As the Constellations became stronger, the shockwaves emitted by the Apocalypse Dragon also became stronger. The moment Hephaestus and Agni, who had been holding out in the front row, were scattered to ashes, the terrified Constellations screamed and ran away.
However, there were some Constellations that did not run away and kept their positions.
<@>[Not yet.]
She was the last remaining Archangel of the 1,863rd <Eden>.
The Demon-like Judge of Fire, Uriel.
The wall of flames built around her blocked the heat wave. How much time had passed like that? Uriel's [Hellfire] began to split the waves of heat little by little.
A disaster that confirmed the destruction of the <Star Stream> along with its manifestation. The Constellations trembled as they watched the disaster being canceled out in real time before their eyes.
<@>[Yes, we did it. We did it!]
<@>[This could really be…!]
Although the damage to the planets other than Earth was enormous, the Constellations that protected the main scenario area regained their spirits.
However, Han Sooyoung's expression was not so bright.
<&>「The flow is not good.」
The scenery in front of me was a scene from a hypothesis that had already been discarded.
<&>「Discarded hypothesis 87413. 'Sabotage'.」
In that hypothesis, the lightning and flame waves of the Apocalypse Dragon were blocked much more easily than expected, and as a result, the Star Stream met a terrible end.
<!>[The <Star Stream>'s probability is moving.]
Han Sooyoung bit her lips.
<@>[What, why is the probability suddenly—]
<@>[Damn it! That's…!]
The <Star Stream>'s probability flows in the direction that the watching Constellations want.
Even in this situation where countless Constellations were facing off against the Apocalypse Dragon, there were still Constellations enjoying the game.
<@>[Why are the Myth-grade Constellations…]
The Myth-grade Constellations had already sacrificed their own legends and escaped the disaster zone.
They were watching the destruction of Earth in the Final Scenario zone.
<!>[The <Star Stream>'s Myth-grade Constellations laugh at the 'Director of the False Ending'.]
They did not want Han Sooyoung and other Constellations to prevent the disaster of the Apocalypse Dragon. If such a 'Tale' were born, Han Sooyoung would have the power to destroy even the positions of the Myth-grade Constellations.
<&>「Third Wave, Chaos.」
The third wave of the Apocalypse Dragon then attacked the Constellations.
<@>[Ahhhhhh!]
The Constellations that were hit by the chaos wave from the front collapsed with a final gasp.
The chaos wave was fundamentally different from the previous lightning wave or flame wave. Only beings with both good and evil characteristics or those who were protected by a 'divinity of the other world' could deal with it. However, this was not without a way to attack. If the Constellations of 'Absolute Good' and 'Absolute Evil' that participated in the Holy Demon War joined forces, and thus could recreate the grand tale of the 'Holy Demon War', it would be possible to arbitrarily implement the attribute of chaos.
However.
<!>[Some Constellations are protected by the 'Nebula' and depart from the scenario!]
Taking advantage of the weakened regulation of the scenario, the Constellations of 'Absolute Good' and 'Absolute Evil' that were protected by the Holy Gate began to depart one by one.
In an instant, only one Constellation of the Holy War remained in the front.
"Uriel! No!"
The incarnation of the Archangel who had thrown everything away along with the flames of [Hellfire] was scattered to ashes.
The balance of the battlefield collapsed, and the Historical-grade Constellations trembled in fear. Everything in the area was being swept away by the chaos wave of the Apocalypse Dragon.
However, Han Sooyoung did not give up.
"I expected this."
Gazing upon the approaching chaos wave, Han Sooyoung took out the Holy Fruit of <Eden> from her bosom. The moment she bit into the 'Fruit of the Tree of Good and Evil', the power of chaos surged from her entire body.
<!>[The power of the 'Fruit of the Tree of Good and Evil' seeps into you!]
<!>[All the Constellations of 'Absolute Good' are astonished by your choice!]
<!>[All the Constellations of 'Absolute Evil' are astonished by your choice!]
<!>[Some Myth-grade Constellations mock you, saying that it is impossible for you to endure the 'Chaos Wave' alone.]
Han Sooyoung also knew.
Eating the Fruit of the Tree of Good and Evil was just a means to use her body as a conduit for 'chaos'.
In order to prevent the approaching disaster, she needed the support of a powerful being that could restrain the Apocalypse Dragon.
The first thing that came to mind was 'Nameless Mist'. However, if she were to summon the 'Nameless Mist', a disaster like the Apocalypse Dragon, the Earth would also be destroyed in return. The worries didn't last long.
"Great ancient being who governs the ancient tales!"
Chaos rings began to rise all over Han Sooyoung's body.
<!>[Nebula, <Papyrus>, warns you!]
<!>[Nebula, <Olympus>, gives orders to the terminal incarnation!]
<!>[Nebula, <Asgard>, is glaring at you!]
Nebula's terminal incarnations rushed toward Han Sooyoung all at once. They were determined to stop Han Sooyoung even at the risk of self-destruction.
This was what the 1,863rd Myth-grade Constellations thought. If they didn't eliminate Han Sooyoung here, Han Sooyoung would become their greatest threat in the future.
The chaos faction was in front, and the incarnations of Nebulae were running from behind.
Even so, Han Sooyoung was smiling.
"I knew it all."
This was the last tale of the <Star Stream> that she had planned.
<&>「Hypothesis 88876. 'Great Chaos'.」
The chaos wave of the Apocalypse covered the Earth.
<!>[The protection of the 'Great Old Being' is upon you.]
While no Constellation dared to utter a word, the chaos wave of the Apocalypse began to be sucked into her hand.
However, even with the power of the 'Great Old Being', it was impossible to completely handle the chaos wave. So instead of accepting the chaos wave, she chose to twist the chaos wave's trajectory and strike it back.
In the direction she twisted the chaos wave's trajectory.
<!>[The Myth-grade Constellations are astonished!]
The 'Myth-grade Constellations' of the Last Scenario were staying there.
Kugugugugugu!
The Constellations screamed. With countless mantras covering the sky, the chaos wave of the Apocalypse covered the Constellations.
<!>[The Myth-grade Constellations aboard the 'Last Ark' roar!]
The sky was covered in pitch-black darkness. The universe flickered, and day and night alternated.
The shining Constellations began to fade, and the number of indirect messages began to decrease one by one. Thick darkness descended, and the universe was covered in silence.
After a while, when even that darkness receded, Han Sooyoung slowly opened her eyes.
What she saw in the sky was the Apocalypse Dragon, crouching back into the seal as if tired, and the 'Last Ark', torn in half and stuck in the atmosphere.
<!>[All the Constellations of the <Star Stream> will never forget the 'Director of the False Ending'.]
The scenario was over.
She blocked the shockwave of the Apocalypse Dragon.
"It's done."
She barely managed to let out a sigh.
The disaster was over. The hypothesis was successful. But when Han Sooyoung slowly turned her head and looked, a landscape that wasn’t in her 「Predictive Plagiarism」 was unfolding.
"Ah."
The characters she had to protect were lying helplessly there.
<&>「Hypothesis 88876. 'Great Chaos'.」
Lee Hyunsung, Kim Namwoon, Lee Jihye, Lee Seolhwa, Shin Yoosoung. And…
<&>「Failure of development.」
The landscape began to tear apart in front of her eyes. As if erasing a sentence that was written incorrectly, the landscape was blurring mercilessly and quickly.
<&>「That had to be a hypothesis.」
Only sentences that were not erased lingered between the torn landscape.
<&>「It was a story that shouldn’t become reality.」
I stared blankly at those sentences.
<&>「That guy probably didn’t want to see this kind of story.」
Han Sooyoung’s voice and system messages were heard occasionally. Han Sooyoung was carrying her fallen comrades in the torn landscape. Fatal injury that could not be revived even with a Life and Death Ring.
<&>「No one should die.」
Her 「Predicitve Plagiarism」 was going wild. The slurry that flowed out engulfed the group.
The power of the other world began to swallow everything in the area. The dead people and the broken headquarters were covered.
And now I was finally realizing how the scenery I had seen had been created.
That's right. The people I had met, the base in Gwanghwamun, all of it was Han Sooyoung's—
"Kim Dokja-ssi."
When I suddenly turned my head, Lee Soohwa was grabbing my wrist.
"We have to go back now."
"I haven't met the real Han Sooyoung yet."
"The Captain doesn't want to meet you. Because..."
"Because I know the whole truth."
Seeing Lee Soohwa hesitate, I added.
"That's why we have to meet even more."
"Sooyoung-ssi—"
"Han Sooyoung should no longer use [Avatar]."
I know what Lee Seolhwa is trying to say.
The ability to cover Gwanghwamun with her [Avatars]. This was not a miracle of the scale that an ordinary Constellation could perform.
Han Sooyoung may have become a being beyond human. She may have been imbued with the power of the 'Great Old Being' she made a contract with, and become a god.
"There is something I absolutely must say."
Even so, I could not give up.
"Don't be greedy."
"..."
"It was the Captain's choice. She created this world, she made us avatars, it was all the Captain's choice. It's not for you to meddle in it."
"..."
"You just have to pretend not to know. Just experience this world the Captain created, and return to your original world like a reader who reads an interesting story. Then—"
I shook off her hand and started to move forward.
"Kim Dokja!"
Lee Seolhwa's voice grew distant, and my vision was covered in darkness again. With every step I took, the darkness rippled noisily.
I soon realized that the darkness was not simply the absence of light.
<&>「Failure.」
<&>「I failed.」
<&>「This story failed.」
This darkness was the remains of her 「Predictive Plagiarism」.
I called Han Sooyoung's name.
"Han Sooyoung!"
Discarded hypotheses. Discarded memories feebly caught my feet.
At the end of the remains was an old door.
I read the small sign on the door.
'Writing'.
The moment I raised my hand to knock on the door, the darkness that jumped out from behind grabbed me. As if telling me not to disturb her, the pitch-black sentences pulled my hands and feet as if they were restraining them. Soon, my hands and feet, caught in the darkness, turned pitch-black. It started to get wet.
"Han Sooyoung!"
Instead of answering, the sound of the keyboard was constantly coming from behind the door. The fact that I could hear this sound meant that Han Sooyoung was also hearing my voice.
"Kim Dokja has already read your story!"
I had to make her open that door herself and come out.
"The story you wrote saved Kim Dokja!"
Perhaps my words could twist the foundation of the universe. I might be driving the universe to destruction once again in order to save one person in front of me.
<&>「I don't know why she is so obsessed with 'readers'.」
However, I thought about Han Sooyoung's life.
<&>「Maybe that's the setting she received as a 'writer'.」
I thought about the countless sentences she had written and erased, and the distant eternity of writing that spread out before her.
<&>「She deserves to know the truth of this world. Just like Yoo Joonghyuk did.」
I thought of the writer who devoted her life to saving just one person, and of the one reader who read that story again. I thought of the two people who never met each other but saved each other. Maybe that salvation is enough. Maybe that world doesn’t need a side story.
Still, wouldn’t it be okay to allow them just one sentence? Even if it’s just a footnote, even if that footnote changes everything in this world.
"You are tls123."
The keyboard stopped clicking.
