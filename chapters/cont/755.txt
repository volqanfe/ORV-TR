<title>755 Episode 32 Monkey King (2)
There are a total of four 'Sun Wukong' in the <Star Stream>.
'Sun Wukong' is divided into a total of four depending on the modifier he has.
The first one was 'Meihouwang' who was the monkey king of Mt. Hwagwa Mountain.
The second is 'Bimawen', who was the stable keeper of the heavenly world.
The third is 'Great Sage Heaven's Equal', whom we know (this guy is the owner of the golden headband).
The fourth is 'Douzhanshengfo', who attained enlightenment at the end of his journey and became Buddha.
Looking at it this way, I felt that he was somehow similar to Kim Dokja. Because Kim Dokja’s existence was divided according to his modifier.
<!>[I asked, are you Kim Dokja?]
"First of all, I am Kim Dokja."
I continued speaking while looking closely at the monkey in front of me.
<&>「Dazzling golden fur. Tattered tiger skin panties. Even his unique eyes that look somewhat drowsy.」
It was definitely true. The monkey in front of me is—
"Are you Meihouwang?"
<!>[This guy. It's quite surprising that you recognize me.]
Meihouwang snorted, placed his hands on his waist and looked triumphant.
Anyway, Meihouwang is a narrative-grade constellation that represents the birth of 'Sun Wukong'. According to Kim Dokja, it was the constellation equivalent of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.
However… What is this?
The impact felt by Meihouwang was not large. At first, I thought it was because I was getting stronger, but I didn't think that was the case.
Is he hiding his true power?
That may be so. Because all Sun Wukongs are good at adjusting the level of the story.
But even so, is it possible for Meihouwang, a narrative-grade constellation, to appear here in an incarnation body?
I don't know.
Since everything that happens these days completely ignores probability, I now doubt whether probability even exists in this world.
<!>[Is that how you see it?]
I guess I was staring too hard.
King Mifu said while scratching his golden hair.
<!>[Is this guy also in love with my fur? Well, even the Great Sage guy is jealous of my fur. He is a man with eyes to see.]
When he says Great Sage, he probably means Great Sage Heaven’s Equal.
Meihouwang chuckled and said with his deep eyes flashing.
<!>[You probably know why I came.]
"I can guess."
Just a few hours ago, I received a message from the 'Monkey' faction saying they were recruiting me.
And the Meihouwang before my eyes was the famous 'Monkey King'.
<!>[The faction 'Monkey God' invites you.]
In other words, Meihouwang is the master of the 'Monkey God' faction.
It's not another monkey, it's Meihouwang.. The scale of the 'Zodiac Ball' might be bigger than I thought.
<!>[Hmm. Even though I came in person, the response was only that much?]
When I saw Meihouwang’s disapproving expression, I thought it was a pity. I should have asked to take a picture together.
<!>[Insolent bastard, come join my forces.]
Meihouwang, like Sun Wukong, didn't even listen to my answer and just kept talking.
<!>[I liked your story. I allow you to become my incarnation.]
To be honest, it would be a lie if I said there wasn't a part that tempted me.
He is the incarnation body of Meihouwang.
If I wasn't the incarnation of the 'Demon King of Salvation', I might have been quite attracted to it.
If I can persuade Meihouwang to succeed in the '4-stage union of Sun Wukong' and then evolve him into 'The AncientLiberator', I will have the strongest mythical constellation in history as my sponsor.
Of course, it was a wrong assumption at this point.
"I’m sorry, but I already have a constellation—"
<!>[Hmph, I already know that your idiot sponsor is away. Are you ignoring me?]
"Even if he is away, once you are behind someone , you are always behind them."
It wasn't even in my mind, but Kim Dokja would have said this. As expected, Meihouwang’s reaction was not bad.
<!>[This guy is more loyal than I thought. I like it.]
"Thank you for your understanding."
<!>[If that’s the case, I will directly order 'cancellation of the constellation contract'.]
"Yes?"
It occurred to me later that I had made a mistake. Meihouwang is Sun Wukong, who has the most eccentric personality among his brothers. He was a 'King of Monkeys' who did whatever he wanted to do.
Just as I was wondering what kind of incredible lie I had to tell to avoid this situation—
A skein of shining golden thread flew from somewhere.
The skein of thread wrapped exactly around Meihouwang’s head. The sound of an order was heard afterwards. Meihouwang, who was holding his head, let out an undignified scream.
<!>[Ngegegegegegegegye—]
<!>[The story 'Monkey Seal' begins its storytelling.]
It's a story about overpowering 'Meihouwang'.
<!>[Okay! I knew!]
With a 'pop' sound, Meihouwang turned into a small monkey. Meihouwang, who was glaring at me disapprovingly, did a somersault, jumped backwards sharply, and climbed on top of a woman.
The woman smiled bitterly at Meihouwang, who shouted "Ukkkkkkk."
"I told you not to do that, right?"
A unique, clear voice that reassures people.
I often thought,
If Yoo Sangah existed in reality, she might have been that person.
Another person in this world who calls me 'writer'.
"Have you written any side stories in the meantime, author?"
Editor Ji Eunyu was there.
***
Ji Eunyu and I parted ways during the fierce battle at the Washington Dome. At that time, she had neither the time nor the presence of mind to say hello.
On one side, the Demon King of Salvation was dying, and on the other side, Yoo Jonghyuk, who had become a black beast, was running rampant.
<!>[The constellation 'Meihouwang' looks at you with disapproving eyes.]
Fortunately, there was only one monkey running wild right now, and even that monkey had calmed down in Ji Eunyu's arms.
Perhaps it was because she had subdued Meihouwang, but it seemed as if a halo could be seen behind Ji Eunyu's back.
"Your spirit has turned white."
" author, it looks like you’re having a hard time."
"Is it noticeable even though I’m wearing a mask?"
"Yes, I can see it."
We exchanged casual greetings and smiled at each other.
There is a unique feeling of relief when I am with Ji Eunyu. I feel like it's okay even if I make mistakes.
My editor not only finds spelling and spacing, but also finds sentences I forgot to write.
She could tell whether I was confident in my writing by reading just a few sentences of the manuscript.
"It’s noticeable."
That's what Ji Eunyu said when I asked her how she knew.
"Editor. I have a lot to ask. Especially…"
Ji Eunyu noticed my sidelong glance at Meihouwang and cleared her throat slightly.
"Have you forgotten who my sponsor is?"
A bit late, a series of information came to mind.
As far as I know, the constellation that Ji Eunyu signed a contract with was 'Lotus Flower Blooming Under the Moonlight'— 'Yoo Sangah, the Emperor of Wolha', a member of <Kim Dokja Company>.
"I chose 'Monkey' among the zodiac signs. I thought that would be the easiest to conquer."
In the story, Yoo Sangah goes through the 'Island of the Reincarnated' and is resurrected through the incarnation of Tang Sanzang(?).
In fact, most of the 'Yeonhwadae' and related skills used by Yoo Sangah are borrowed from Sanzang’s tale.
The metaphor is a judgment.
"If I go to the 'Monkey' faction, I can use my sponsor’s story."
I was secretly impressed.
"But the monkey force could have been without Sun Wukong."
"This is the 'Recycling Center'. I thought Sun Wukong would definitely be there. Instead, it’s the somewhat unpopular Sun Wukong."
Indeed, the power of reasoning to find even unwritten sentences.
<!>[The constellation 'Meihouwang' is complaining that he is ignored again!]
Ji Eunyu gently scratched Meihouwang’s chin and continued her words.
"And when I got to the monkey area, there was this big cave. I was immediately convinced."
"Huagua Mountain Convergence Cave."
"Yes, there was this person there."
Who would have guessed that the 'monkey area' of the Chinese zodiac was the birthplace of Meihouwang?
It was undoubtedly an excellent place for 
'recycling'.
" author, you didn’t choose any faction, right?"
"Yes."
"I knew you would. Because you’re the type of person who only takes the hardest path."
"It really wasn’t easy this time."
"Still, you definitely feel different than before. Your back seems to have straightened a bit."
"Is that so?"
I looked down at my body again. Now that I think about it, I feel like my body has improved a little.
"I understand that you went around having fun without writing what you were told to write."
Although I heard some nagging, meeting Ji Eunyu here was a blessing.
From the looks of it, Meihouwang doesn't seem to have any particular hostility towards us.
<!>[Level 2 of the exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is activated.]
It was then that I suddenly heard a skill activation message.
<!>[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint has never been activated in this way, so maybe it's the influence of the 'Constellation Act'.]
I could hear someone's inner thoughts in my head.
<&>「Who is it.」
I immediately knew whose thoughts those were. This person doesn't use question marks even when thinking.
<&>「She called him writer.」
"By the way, I’m late for the introduction. Editor, this is Cha Yerin. Yerin, this is my editor."
But this time, I heard the other side’s inner thoughts.
<&>「Writer, is it okay to say that?」
There were a little too many 'inner feelings'.
<&>「Did he reveal that he was a writer?」
<&>「Then it’ll be a little bit difficult, right?」
Yes. therefore.
<&>「If it’s someone he can trust, it’ll be okay.」
<&>「But Kim Dokja didn’t reveal his identity until much later.」
Let me explain.
<&>「What if that person betrays us?」
<&>「I think we need to come up with a separate response plan.」
<&>「As a first measure—」
I quickly intervened before Ji Eunyu’s plan of action could progress any further.
"Editor, this person is my reader. You can rest assured."
"Ah."
"I revealed my secret. She is my only reader."
"The only… reader?"
I happened to express it that way, but it wasn't wrong.
Cha Yerin is probably the only person who read and remembers my debut work.
<&>「Then what about me?」
Eh?
"Nice to meet you. I’m Ji Eunyu. I’m the person who reads and edits the author’s writing before anyone else."
Only then did I suddenly come to my senses.
Come to think of it, Cha Yerin wasn't the only one. Although she may not have read my debut novel, Ji Eunyu was a reader who read my novels before anyone else and read them more.
"I’m Cha Yerin. I’ve read all of his novels."
Ji Eunyu's expression changed completely after hearing Cha Yerin's introduction.
"You’ve read all of the author’s novels?"
"Yes."
"Even the Genesis trilogy?"
"Yes."
"You’re a complete Kim Dokja."
"Kim Dokja…"
Cha Yerin awkwardly looked down at her toes.
Now I understand. That's an embarrassing expression.
"What path did you take when reading the book?"
"I read it in paperback first, but I bought it all later. The serial version, the copy, and—"
"Wow! Thank you so much! What are you doing, writer? You need to thank her quickly."
"Thank you."
I suddenly said thanks to her.
"Bigger! She’s the one who saved our management from almost being ruined!"
"Thank you!"
"If you need an autographed copy, please let me know anytime! I don’t have the book right now, but—"
When I thought about it, this was Ji Eunyu’s true self. I was worried for no reason.
<!>[The constellation 'Meihouwang' yawns, saying he doesn’t know what you are talking about.]
<!>[The constellation 'Meihouwang' urges you to proceed with the scenario quickly.]
"Look at that. Come to think of it, this wasn’t the time."
"Yes, well. Let’s leave our greetings like this."
"Do you know where this place is?"
In response to Ji Eunyu’s question, I looked around at the surrounding scenery.
"Yes. I know."
A landscape covered in clouds everywhere.
<&>「This is the place where Kim Dokja waited for the carriage during the 'Constellation Banquet'.」
The name of this place is 'Cloud Road'.
A place that serves as a tributary and station connecting the scenarios of the <Star Stream>. That means,
"The carriage will be here soon."
As if to prove my thoughts, I saw something like a small dot flying from afar in the sky. The dot grew bigger little by little, and as expected, it took on the shape of a carriage.
Cha Yerin said with admiration.
"A carriage like that came during the constellation banquet."
At that time, it was Apollo's golden chariot.
The carriage coming this time was also a luxurious golden carriage.
The difference was that this time it was the little rats that were pulling the carriage.
<!>[The constellation 'Meihouwang' is complaining that the organizers have used their coins in the wrong place again.]
A golden carriage at the 'Recycling Center'. Perhaps in which scenario was that used first?
<!>[New sub-scenario has arrived!]
+
<Sub Scenario - Orient Express Wagon>
Category: Sub
Difficulty: S++
Clear conditions: Get on the carriage. Arrive at your destination safely.
Time limit: 2 hours
Reward: 'Zodiac Ball' admission ticket.
Failure: Death.
+
On the outside, it was such a peaceful scenario that one wondered if this could even be a scenario. But.
"Is this it?"
Ji Eunyu asked.
"That’s it."
I answered.
As any aspiring Killer King knows, the carriage Kim Dokja is riding in in the 'Constellations' Banquet' is attacked by constellations and crashes.
The mere fact that 'riding on a carriage' came up as a scenario means that this carriage will inevitably suffer the same fate.
Above all, the meaningful sentence 'arrive at your destination safely' proved this.
I smiled bitterly and opened my mouth.
"There is no way to get over this easily."
"Who can I blame?"
"Yes?"
"I told you when I was serializing. Sometimes you need an easy scenario so readers can take a break."
I didn't know it would come back to me like this either.
"I was wrong."
Even the difficulty level of the sub-scenario is S++.
At this point, I suspect that the 'Recycling Center’s Director' may also be a possessed person.
A carriage that strangely resembled Apollo's golden carriage finally stopped in front of me. The squeaking rats lowered their heads as if to say hello.
The moment I put my hand on the carriage door handle to board, a message came out.
<!>[Only designated incarnations can ride this carriage.]
<!>[Story fragment 'Facial Recognition' is activated.]
It’s a carriage with a 'face recognition' function.
Was it by any chance made in <Emperor>?
Ji Eunyu and Cha Yerin, who completed facial recognition, boarded in turn, followed by my turn.
<!>[Face recognition failed.]
I thought it was broken, but when I thought about it, I was still wearing the mask. It's not even a metaphorical object for the carriage, so no one would recognize me wearing a mask.
Now that the Zone 13 scenario was over, there was no reason to insist on masking any longer.
<!>[Release the 'mask'.]
As I took off my mask for the first time in a while, the stuffy feeling disappeared and cool air enveloped my face.
I relaxed my neck for a moment and lightly rolled my shoulders, but my face felt strangely hot.
When I looked up, Ji Eunyu and Cha Yerin were looking at me with surprised eyes.
<!>[The constellation Meihouwang is looking at you blankly.]
The same was true for Meihouwang, who was sitting on Ji Eunyu’s head.
What followed was Meihouwang’s voice heard in my ears.
<!>[This guy. That’s interesting.]
My face was reflected in the carriage window that slowly opened.
I stared at this face for a long time, even forgetting that I had to get on the carriage.
The person I possessed was clearly Cheon Inho. However,
<!>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' smiles with satisfaction as he looks at you.]
Reflected in the window, I was wearing Kim Dokja’s face.
