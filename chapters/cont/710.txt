<title>710 Episode 26 Star Ladder (6)
Cheok Jungyeong's first Japanese meal that serves a thousand people at once.
Ilgeomchamcheon.
I was familiar with its grandeur and performance. Because I wrote that sentence with my own hands.
When was it? Was it when Kim Dokja, who was imprisoned in [Hundred Days of Seal], borrowed 'Ganpyeongui' and summoned Cheok Jungyeong?
<&>「A swordsmanship cultivated over a lifetime by a great genius who may only appear once every tens of thousands of years. The most ideal cut created solely for destruction.」
But now that I look at it, I feel like I need to change that sentence a bit.
Why didn't I write down that it hurts to use it?
No. Did I write it down? If it was written, it was insufficient.
It felt like someone had bent all my joints in a way that made them impossible to move. Even though [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] was activated, the pain was felt right down to my soul.
Looking at my tattered right hand, I wondered how on earth Kim Dokja could endure something like this.
—This is barely a sword, youngest.
It's barely like this.
So, just what level of destructive power are Cheok Jungyeong's three swords and the four swords created after that?
—That Cheok Jungyeong was also blocked at 'great-grade'. The guys you have to deal with in the future are higher than that.
I can't even guess.
What kind of story must we build to reach that place? Is it really possible to reach it?
How was it possible for Kim Dokja not to be scared even when facing that high sky?
—You can do it. Because we already did it once.
The thick dust cleared and there was only one constellation left where the blade passed.
<!>[How...]
The six brilliantly shining stars of <Asgard> have set.
There is only one thing left. Only 'Valkyrie's Daughter' remained. Even then, more than half of her incarnation body was blown away.
As her spear, which had been resting on the floor, scattered into powder, Valkyrie's Daughter fell to the ground.
<!>[This technique is definitely that monster's...]
The trembling woman also seemed to recognize Cheok Jungyeong's sword.
Cheok Jungyeong, like Kim Dokja, was cursed with [Fate] and became an enemy of the giant nebula, so it was no surprise that Valkyrie's Daughter recognized this technique.
Afterwards, Valkyrie's Daughter, whose magic power flowed back, began to vomit.
<!>[Oh, no. It can't end like this—]
And.
<!>['Ginnungagap' ends.]
I felt the curtain surrounding me disappear. The curtain of 'Ginnungagap' staged in <Asgard> is finally about to disappear.
<!>[The effect of 'Ginnungagap' is activated.]
<!>[What happened in 'Ginnungagap' is not recorded in the world line.]
The curtain disappeared, revealing the ruined city of Washington. The incarnations nearby looked at each other blankly.
Valkyrie's Daughter, who had not yet been lifted from 'half-body advent', also looked embarrassed.
<!>[How on earth did this happen...]
The reason that 'half-body advent' was not lifted is probably because the power of 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' was damaged.
What was puzzling was her reaction.
<!>[Wh-where has everyone gone! Constellations, what's going on! Why me—]
Valkyrie's daughter, who had been spouting off a bunch of stories, croaked. It seems as if she had forgotten all previous events.
She wasn't the only one having this strange reaction.
"Cheon Inho?"
Anna Croft, who had been watching the battle by my side, was asking with a confused look on her face.
"What on earth happened? Why is Valkyrie’s daughter…? No, these traces…"
With those words, Anna activated [Past Tense]. But all that came back was a light spark.
Afterwards, it was felt that the incarnations of the area were shaking in confusion.
"What happened to the Black Beast?"
"What? Why am I here…"
"The black beast has fallen!"
"It’s a constellation! A constellation has descended!"
"I feel like my head is going to explode."
What happened inside 'Ginnungagap' is not recorded. However, this 'record' apparently also included the 'memories' of humans and constellations.
Anna Croft, who had been staring blankly into space, came to her senses and muttered.
"No way... 'Ginnungagap'?"
She was also a prophet. Did she realize what had happened in that short period of time?
Anyway, it was disappointing.
The fact that everything that happened in 'Ginnungagap' was not recorded also meant that the things that happened there could not be made into stories.
It was unfair that the incident of executing as many as ten 'great-grade constellations' was not recognized as a story, but somehow they survived.
But when I thought about it, something felt strange.
<&>「I remember all the incidents that happened in 'Ginnungagap'.」
Along with the feeling of my heart becoming cold, I felt the power of the story surrounding Kim Dokja and me.
<!>[The story 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear' is in effect.]
<!>[You are not affected by the record erasure effect of 'Ginnungagap'.]
<!>[The constellations of the nebula <Asgard> are greatly embarrassed.]
<!>[The nebula <Asgard> protests to the Bureau.]
.
.
<!>[Your record will be sent to the <Star Stream>.]
<!>[Your achievements have been recorded in the <Star Stream>.]
<!>[You have achieved an achievement that does not exist!]
<!>[The <Star Stream> reviews your achievements.]
Since when did it start? 'Valkyrie’s Daughter’s' expression was grotesquely distorted as she looked at me.
<!>[Nonsense—How to do 'Ginnungagap'?]
She also realized what was happening.
She urgently looked up at the sky and burst out with her loud mantra.
<!>[Stop it! Constellations! We must kill him quickly! Right now!]
Sparks of probability were swirling around 'Valkyrie’s Daughter'.
<!>[He remembers everything that happened inside 'Ginnungagap'!]
What it meant was clear.
I don't know why, but the incident we committed was recorded as a 'story'.
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' requests to view the records.]
<!>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' requests to view the records.]
<!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' requests access to the records.]
<!>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' requests to view the records.]
<!>[The constellation 'Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake' requests to view the records.]
…
Endless indirect messages.
<!>[The Management Bureau is reviewing your 'new story'!]
I said, suppressing my overflowing heart.
'Constellation-nim.'
If this incident is recognized as a 'story', I will get a story about the massacre of 'ten great-grade constellations' in the seventh scenario.
An impossible story told on a stage where recording is impossible.
An achievement that not even Kim Dokja in the main story could achieve.
I couldn't even guess what kind of story I was going to receive.
However, Kim Dokja—that is, the 'Demon King of Salvation'—looked strangely reluctant.
—This is not good.
'It's not good?'
—Youngest, do you remember that I was given [fate]?
Of course I remember.
Because of the [fate] he received at that time, Kim Dokja died several times and was even expelled from the scenario in the tenth scenario.
—That was the 'eight scenario'. But if this happens in only the seventh scenario, what do you think the giant nebulae will look like?
'Ah...'
—Shit. I thought it would be okay because it was 'Ginnungagap'.
I remembered what the 'giant nebulae' were.
In this <Star Stream>, these guys are more serious about the fight for food than anyone else. They were the ones who called on [Fate] to stop Kim Dokja.
There's no way those guys would just sit by and watch us, who defeated ten 'great-grade constellations'.
The intervals between thunder sounds, as if representing our anxiety, were becoming shorter and shorter.
I asked, swallowing my ominousness.
'Are they going to deploy additional constellations?'
<Asgard> would have suffered enormous losses just by bringing in 'Ginnungagap'.
I wanted to believe that no matter how large the nebula was, it would be difficult to sustain any further damage.
—It would be nice if not...
<!>['Bookmark' is released.]
<!>['Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is temporarily disabled.]
With a tremendous recoil, my vision darkened as if a fuse had blown, but slowly recovered.
Anna Croft helped me as I stumbled.
"Cheon Inho? Are you okay? Cheon Inho!"
I nodded at her and stood upright with her support.
"What is this, what happened in 'Ginnungagap'?"
"I’ll explain later, but for now, Yoo Jonghyuk—"
The moment I said that, light sparks flew throughout my body and my vitality returned, albeit slightly.
<!>['Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is activated again!]
—Additional probability was paid.
Additional probability?
—Something seems wrong. Be careful, youngest.
This 'scenario' is a scenario that balances the scales instead of causing repercussions.
The fact that extra probability arose on this side meant that someone other than us was using that much probability on the other side of the scale.
What appeared beyond the portal were incarnations in exotic costumes. Judging by the atmosphere they gave off, they seemed to be from the Balkan Peninsula or the Mediterranean.
Anna Croft, who discovered them, greeted them first.
"Are they the Greeks incarnation?"
One of the group nodded.
"The scenario is already over. You can go back."
It was just as Anna Croft said.
<!>[The current sub-scenario has ended.]
Yoo Jonghyuk, who became the black beast, has fallen, and the reward for the 'sub-scenario' is out.
It became Kim Dokja’s responsibility.
But now additional personnel have been dispatched?
It was a bad situation no matter who looked at it. In fact, instead of responding to Anna Croft's words, the guys quickly looked around.
"As expected, <Asgard> came first."
The man who found the fallen 'Valkyrie's Daughter' muttered, and the incarnations nearby helped.
"You bastards. Did you really use 'Ginnungagap'?"
"You paid that price just to deal with one incarnation?"
'Valkyrie’s Daughter' growled, her eyes wide.
<!>[You guys. Who are you?]
The angry mantra uttered by 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' caused an uproar throughout the area.
However, despite the constellation's attack, the incarnations seemed completely unfazed.
"It’s pathetic. Even after using 'Ginnungagap', you failed."
Clearly they were incarnations. However, no matter how you look at their tone, it was not like incarnations.
The enraged 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' spewed out her mantra once again.
<!>[This is the area of <Asgard>! I don’t know who you guys are, but—]
The words of 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' could not continue. Because her head had already been cut off and sent flying away.
The Greek man who brushed off his bloody shamshir grinned, held her severed head and shook it.
"Good things must be shared, friend."
No matter how much strength is exhausted, it is a power that can cut down a constellation that has 'half-strengthened' in one blow.
<!>[The constellation 'Gatekeeper of Thebes' grins.]
Thebes? Damn it. no way.
—I know what kind of guys they are.
<!>[The constellations of <Olympus> are looking at you.]
After <Asgard>, it's <Olympus>.
'I think they came looking for fragments too.'
—I guess there was a rumor that we were a good restaurant.
The incarnations that appeared were all incarnations of <Olympus>.
Looking at the flow of probability flowing around, it seems that the constellations of Olympus are controlling the incarnations by raising the synchronization rate to the limit.
Kim Dokja borrowed my mouth and said something.
"You guys seem to be misunderstanding something, but this isn’t 'Holy Demon War' or 'Gigantomachia'."
Even if it is a scenario where the 'scale of probability' works, there is a degree.
If the weight that the scale cannot support rises, the scale will eventually break and the scenario will end in catastrophe.
"Are you all here just to be burned to death by lightning? No matter how absurd the odds are—"
As if to prove Kim Dokja's words, lightning flashed in the air.
However, a new portal was opening in the place where the lightning flashed.
There wasn't only one.
Incarnations wearing various costumes were popping out one after another from dozens of portals that opened simultaneously.
<!>[The constellations of the nebula <Ghost> are looking at you.]
<Ghost>.
<!>[The constellations of the nebula <Tree of Protection> are looking at you.]
<Tree of Protection>.
<!>[The constellations of the nebula <Vedas> are looking at you.]
...<Vedas>.
When I checked there, I heard Kim Dokja's voice.
—Youngest.
'Yes.'
We began to run away, carrying the fallen Yoo Jonghyuk on our backs.
