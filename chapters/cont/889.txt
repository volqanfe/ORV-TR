<title>889 Episode 48 Avatar (12)
My fingertips trembled violently.
I wondered if that was true.
Maybe the reason Han Sooyoung created so many avatars was…
<&>「Scenario 95. 'The Reincarnation of the Apocalypse'.」
The screen changed, and the scenario began to play out in real time before my eyes.
"Captain, are we okay?"
The sound of the sealing ball in the sky moving was heard along with Kim Namwoon's worried voice.
It would take three days for the seal to be completely released.
<&>「"The Apocalypse is not over just because it's been released. You know that, right?"」
Han Sooyoung agreed with Kim Dokja.
"I'll tell you in advance, there's no way for us to fight the Apocalypse head-on and win."
The Apocalypse that was coming this time was the disaster that destroyed <Eden> in the past Holy Demon War. There was no way that human power could stop the disaster that even destroyed the giant nebula.
"But there is a way for everyone to survive."
Han Sooyoung said as he looked around at her party.
"We just have to abandon Earth."
'The Resurrection of the Apocalypse' is a scenario whose goal is to liberate the Apocalypse.
They could survive if they moved to the next scenario area before the creature woke up.
Is that all?
Now that they had liberated the Apocalypse, they could also receive a reward.
The giant tale, 「Liberator of the Apocalypse」.
It was truly an enormous reward.
They would probably be able to meet most of the conditions needed for the 'introduction, development, climax, and conclusion' with the 'giant tale' they obtained this time. And in the last scenario, they would be able to compete with the giant nebulae.
But they had to discard the cards they needed to discard for that.
"Don't worry, I'll take all of my colleagues from headquarters with me."
The colleagues looked half in doubt. Lee Jihye was the first to raise an objection.
"Captain. Even if we move, not everyone else can go."
"What about the constellations on the Korean Peninsula?"
Lee Hyunsung also nodded and added.
Unlike Han Sooyoung, who became a constellation herself, all of her colleagues had contracts with a sponsor. Even if the incarnations move on to the next scenario, their sponsor is in a different situation.
"The sea messenger and the Guamsinui are all from the Earth as the origin of the legend. If the Earth disappears because of the Muk Shiryong..."
The constellations that lost the origin of their legend could face the risk of extinction.
That wasn't the only problem.
"There are also people who didn't receive this main scenario."
Including the craftsmen, those who couldn't move on to the 'next scenario area'.
"Captain, we're fine."
"Thank you for leading us this far."
The incarnations who couldn't participate in the Muk Shiryong liberation battle because they didn't meet the qualifications for the scenario.
If the party moves on like this, all the remaining ones will be abandoned. And if they’re unlucky, they’ll be swept away by the destruction of the Earth and scattered as story fragments.
Han Sooyoung bit her lip.
She couldn’t save everyone. 「Predictive Plagiarism」 wasn’t omnipotent, she knew that well.
But even though she knew that well, why was she so troubled?
<&>「"I wish there was a story where no one dies."」
Is it because she heard that from Kim Dokja?
<&>「Scenario 95, hypothesis 1575 'Apocalypse Dragon Resealing' discarded.」
<&>「Scenario 95, hypothesis 5612 'Lee Yijae' discarded.」
Han Sooyoung thought and thought again.
<&>「Scenario 95, hypothesis 9413 'Sealing Orb Reinforcement' discarded.」
<&>「Scenario 95, hypothesis 18563 'Yophiel' discarded.」
…
She destroyed countless worlds inside her in real time, searching for a method and finding it again.
The result.
<&>「Scenario 95, hypothesis 88875 'Grand Banquet'.」
She arrived at a hypothesis.
<&>「Success rate less than 30%.」
A hypothesis is only a hypothesis when it's in your head. The moment even one sentence of that hypothesis comes out of your head, it becomes reality.
<&>「If it fails, all the main characters will be annihilated.」
A failed plan will lead to the end of reality. A writer who knows that well should never have mentioned this plan out loud.
Still.
"Just one."
Han Sooyoung opened her mouth after a long silence.
"If there's a way to defeat the Apocalypse and protect the Earth... will you try it?"
If it were the usual Han Sooyoung, she wouldn't have brought that up to the group.
A plan that takes that much risk can't be called a 'plan'.
But Han Sooyoung was different that day.
"If it fails, everyone could die."
She took her time explaining the plan. She paid extra attention when explaining the level of risk. She explained and explained for a long time that they didn’t have to make this choice, that they were walking into the pit of hell instead of the safe path.
The group listened carefully to Han Sooyoung.
And when the story finally ended, Lee Jihye asked.
"Why didn’t you tell me about that method earlier?"
For some reason, the group looked delighted. Even though the plan had less than a 30% success rate, and even though it was a plan that could easily wipe out everyone here, the expressions on the group’s faces after hearing the story were strangely bright.
"I waited for the captain to say that."
"We can now fight properly."
Looking at the faces of the group, Han Sooyoung also realized something a little late.
She wasn’t the only one who was inspired by Kim Dokja—or by the story he left behind.
"A 30% success rate is a very high success rate. And captain, you can’t execute that plan alone, right?"
The plan was established.
But not long after that, Han Sooyoung began to think.
<&>「That plan had to be a 'hypothesis'.」
The moment I unconsciously held my breath, the scene changed once again.
When I blinked, the first thing I saw was the gorgeous chandelier hanging from the ceiling.
I was standing in a banquet hall.
As I stood there blankly, several incarnations of the constellations came and bumped into me. As I lost my balance and stumbled, someone grabbed my hand.
"I told you to come to your senses."
It was Lee Seolhwa.
With music flowing from somewhere, Lee Seolhwa naturally grabbed both of my hands. We started dancing together.
I answered, moving my feet to the beat.
"I’m sorry."
"If you don't read the story properly, the story will read you."
I nodded and took a deep breath.
"What is this banquet hall?"
As I looked around, I noticed some familiar faces.
It wasn't just Lee Seolhwa. Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, and Kim Namwoon were each taking up a table in the banquet hall.
There were also incarnations from overseas. China's Fei Hu, India's Ranbir Khan, Japan's Asuka Ren.
Next to them were the incarnations of the constellations. The Maritime War God, the Bald General of Justice, the First Sword of Goryeo, and the golden king.
There were also incarnations of the constellations of the great nebula, the incarnations of the constellations of the narrative or myth-grade.
The overwhelming feeling of the stars was so great that the wide hall felt cramped.
Lee Seolhwa, who had seen them with me, asked.
"You said you wanted to know the truth of the world, right?"
Lee Seolhwa said with a slightly sad smile.
"Then look straight ahead."
To the podium in the center of the hall I saw Han Sooyoung come up.
"Thank you all for gathering."
Han Sooyoung, who was standing on the podium, opened her mouth.
<&>「Scenario 95. Hypothesis 88875 'Grand Banquet' execution.」
It had been a while since I had heard such eloquence. It was a speech that was neat and tidy, but emphasized the necessary parts appropriately. Anyone with ears could not help but be moved.
The content of the speech was simple.
<&>「Let's create a 'single tale' that all constellations share.」
When the speech was finally over, there was a great reaction in the banquet hall.
<!>[The constellation, 'Maritime War God', shares the same intentions as 'Director of the False Ending'.]
<!>[The constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', nods and cheers.]
<!>[The constellation, 'Goryeo’s First Sword', agrees with 'Director of the False Ending'.]
…
However, not all the constellations were friendly to her.
<!>[The constellation, 'Ferocious Lord', asks if you called him to tell him something ridiculous.]
<!>[The Demon King claims that the 'Black Maned Lion' is just nonsense that doesn't need to be heard anymore.]
<!>[The constellation, 'Almighty Sun', shakes his head.]
<!>[The constellations of the nebula, <Asgard>, prepare to leave.]
Han Sooyoung coldly warned those constellations.
"If you run away like that now, there's no turning back."
<!>[Some constellations laugh at the words of the 'Director of the False Ending.']
<!>[A small number of myth-grade constellations say that they don't need to take such risks.]
"Yes, you myth-grade constellations would be like that. But what about the guys below you? What about the constellations that didn't make it to the final scenario? When the Apocalypse starts to twitch its tail, all of these children will die."
<!>[Some constellations ask if that's true.]
<!>[A few myth-grade constellations are silent.]
"We haven't tried it."
The solution to some scenarios is very simple. However, since the solution is so simple that anyone can think of it, no one thinks of it as the solution.
"Never before have all the constellations faced a single disaster."
Han Sooyoung's plan was clear.
The Apocalypse starts to 'twitch its tail' as soon as it is resurrected. If only the Apocalypse's 'resurrection disaster' could be prevented, the constellations would have a chance.
"It's possible. You all know that. There is no 'truly impossible' scenario in this <Star Stream>."
The constellations were shaken by her words.
Han Sooyoung continued.
"It's possible if everyone dreams of the same story. If everyone wants the same scenario, it's quite possible. Because—"
After a short pause, Han Sooyoung finished her words.
"You are the <Star Stream>."
If Han Sooyoung, who didn't trust the constellations, had been her usual self, she would never have carried out that plan.
<&>「To hold a single 'grand banquet' and unite the constellations.」
Even so, the reason Han Sooyoung adopted the plan was probably because the constellations who changed her mind were also constellations.
<!>[The constellations of the nebula, <Olympus>, prepare to leave the scenario.]
However, the constellations had lived too long to be persuaded by a brief speech. Their choice had been predetermined.
<!>[The constellations of the nebula, <Veda>, prepare to leave the scenario.]
Faced with the catastrophe before her eyes, Han Sooyoung smiled as if she had expected that.
"Yeah, I knew it. But you don't have a choice anyway, do you?"
<!>[From now on, 'Scenario departures' are restricted.]
"Because."
<!>[Warning! The resurrection of the 'Final Dragon of the Apocalypse' is imminent!]
In order to gather the constellations together and borrow their power, Han Sooyoung made a drastic choice.
"The disaster has already begun."
<&>「That is, to bring forward the 'Resurrection of the Apocalypse' by a few hours earlier than scheduled.」
A loud noise echoed through the sky. The entire banquet hall seemed to shake dangerously, and the Apocalypse Dragon began to poke its head out through the broken seal.
"From now on, we will create the final tale of the <Star Stream>."
Han Sooyoung's plan was perfect.
Attracting the constellations and making them all fight against the 'Apocalypse Dragon' at the same time.
But as always, a perfect plan did not necessarily guarantee success.
<&>「Scenario 95, 'The Second Coming of the Apocalypse Dragon'.」
That day when the night sky of the <Star Stream> was brightly lit by a director.
<&>「Failure of the scenario strategy.」
The universe of the 1,863rd round returned to the darkness of the beginning.
