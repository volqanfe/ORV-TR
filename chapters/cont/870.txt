<title>870 Episode 47 King of Fear (14)
<!>[The story, 'Pebble and I', stops talking.]
I couldn't hide any longer.
I left Yoo Joonghyuk to Anna and ran towards Cheok Jungyeong.
Cheok Jungyeong's eyes widened when he found me, and soon he smiled bitterly. He pulled out the spear from his stomach as if this level of injury was nothing and reached out to me.
<!>[Go away!]
The gust of wind from his hand blew me away.
"Kim Dokja!"
Anna Croft shouted.
At the same time, the great constellations of <Olympus> who had found me stepped forward with flags.
<!>[It's a fragment of Kim Dokja!]
<!>[Retrieve that guy too!]
<Olympus>'s goal was not just the 'King of Fear'. Having secured a large number of 'Kim Dokja fragments', I was also one of their targets for capture. I activated [Way of the Wind] and got away from them, briefly relaying the situation to Anna Croft.
Anna Croft listened to my story with a serious expression, then nodded as if she had made up her mind.
"If you press that 'button', you can stop the war."
"Theoretically, yes."
The 'reset button' of the Fear Realm is literally a button that reverses 'everything' that happened in the Fear Realm. If I could just press that button, the events here would go back to 'before the end'.
The problem is that I don't know when 'before the end' will be.
"I'll help you."
The constellations' artillery fire passed by in front of my nose.
I asked, spitting out acrid smoke.
"Can you use [Future Sight]?"
"If it's short. I can't see too far into the future."
"That's enough."
Even in the desperate 40th round, we somehow found a way. No matter how strong the constellations of <Olympus> are, if we join forces, we can definitely overcome them.
"Over there!"
It would be fast if we flew with full force using [Way of the Wind], but in this situation, we couldn't do anything that would catch the eye.
"Turn to the right!"
I calmly followed Anna Croft's instructions. I pushed back the constellations that rushed at me using [Way of the Wind] and [White-Blue Ganggi], and when threatening bombardments came flying, I knelt down next to the incarnations of the dead constellations.
Kwakwakwakwakwa!
We ran through the thick smoke. We had to run a little faster.
We had to use the time that the King of Fear and the captain-level transcendental constellations were giving us preciously.
Boom!
However, even with [Future Sight], we couldn't read all the bombardments. A blind shell flew towards us, and Anna Croft and I reflexively threw ourselves in a different direction. When I got up, covered in dust and coughing, I instinctively called out to Anna Croft.
"Anna."
Stories were flowing from her bloody legs.
Anna answered calmly.
—Kim Dokja, listen carefully. After all, the constellations' targets are not me or the tyrant.
"But—"
—I will continue to relay the path through transmission. Go quickly.
Anna Croft hid behind the corpses of the Outer Gods that had exploded while carrying Yoo Joonghyuk.
I looked at Anna for a moment then bit my lips and started running.
Anna's voice filled my ears between the pouring artillery fire.
—Watch out for the back!
—They're flying in from the left!
—Ahead! There's a trap set right in front of you!
—Wait a minute there! Count to 5, then turn left and run!
I ran and ran, listening to the instructions without thinking.
How much time had passed like that? Finally, the exit of the 'Big House' began to come into view in the distance.
—From now on, it's straight ahead.
Straight ahead?
—Yes. We have to go straight ahead and break through.
I looked at the hundreds of constellations blocking my path. They were the troops that <Olympus> had set up in advance, knowing that I would come toward the exit.
"How can I go straight ahead?"
However, Anna's voice could no longer be heard. What had happened? I hurriedly looked back, but Anna was nowhere to be seen.
Instead, what caught my eye was <Olympus>'s mythical constellation, the 'Spear that Draws the Boundary of the Seas'.
Kukukukukukukuku.
Poseidon was pounding the floor with his Tryana. Every time the floor and the spearhead collided, the surrounding atmosphere swirled and tore apart the Outer Gods.
<!>[Transmission is basically a technique that transmits sound by carrying it through compressed air. If the air in the area was controlled by Poseidon, it was only natural that Anna's Echo would not be transmitted.]
<!>[Catch them.]
At Poseidon's command, Jason, Achilles, and other great constellations rushed toward me.
Anna said. Break through them.
Then that meant I had a way to break through them. I thought I knew how. The story I had accumulated while experiencing a series of events in the Fear Realm was telling me how.
<!>[The story, 'Friend of Fear', begins its storytelling.]
As the story began its storytelling, my confidence surged.
<!>[It's over there! Catch them!]
The great constellations' spears flew in, taking advantage of the gap I had paused.
I took a deep breath and thought.
This is the 'Big House' of the Fear Realm.
With the power of the 'Great King of Fear', all kinds of 'fear' had gathered here.
<!>[Use story fragment, 'Remote Signal Controller'.]
Of course, there were fears that I had cleared.
<!>[Catastrophic fear, 'Alien Signal Light' is activated!]
The light of the signal light that was flashing in the distance changed, and the constellations that were chasing after me screamed with a loud noise.
<!>[Kwaaaaah! What the!]
I started running, leaving behind the terrible crashing sound that was pushing me forward and backward.
<!>[The constellation 'Spear that Draws the Boundary of the Sea' expresses its anger at you!]
I felt a dreary gaze from behind me, then the Triana's spear passed by me with a dizzying sensation.
The spear created a strong wind and blew away the 'Alien Signal Light' in the area.
Damn it.
<!>[Enough! Chase him!]
I still had a long way to the exit. I thought I should activate [Way of the Wind] and fly away instead. Even if it draws some of their attention, if you want to run the shortest distance quickly, it’s better to fly here—
<!>[Kuaaaaak!]
<!>[What the hell—]
I heard the constellations that were rushing toward me from the front being torn apart. It sounded like a shrimp’s back being crushed between whales.
When I blinked my eyes stupidly, there was a guy who really looked like a whale.
<#>【Ooooooooooooo!】
A cry that tore through my ears.
It was the 'fear' I knew.
<!>[Natural Disaster-level Fear, 'Tooth Fin', roars!]
Tooth Fin.
It was the 'shark head' I had met at the entrance to the Fear Realm.
Every time the guy swung his tail once, five or six great-level constellations would fall.
"You… have become a 'Natural Disaster-level'!"
I shouted happily, and the guy flicked his fin once. It seemed to tell me to get on.
I climbed on the guy's back without hesitation. As the streamlined giant body writhed, the surrounding scenery began to rush forward.
<!>[Don't miss it.]
Poseidon once again drew the floor with his spear. The sea boundary split and the waves that rose from the crater covered our rear like a tsunami.
However, Poseidon's choice was a mistake.
This guy was 'Tooth Fin'. The fear that ruled the sea of ​​fear.
Following the sharp surge of the waves, Tooth Fin accelerated even more and arrived at the exit of the 'Big House' in an instant.
'Tooth Fin' blocked the exit with its huge body and stopped the constellations chasing me.
"Thank you."
<#>【Teeth Teeth Teeth Teeth Teeth Teeth Teeth】
After greeting the guy whose teeth were chattering, I slid down the streamlined back and opened the exit door. As I stepped out of the door, I saw the 'Time Fault Room' in shambles. I looked straight up.
The top of the 'Time Fault Room'.
<!>[1863-99th round.]
Next to the Time Fault sign that said so, I saw a small button. It was the 'reset button' I was looking for.
Quaddududduk.
I heard something creaking inside the door of the 'Big House'.
Then, a terrible thunder echoed.
There was no time.
I immediately used [Way of the Wind] and soared into the sky. Fortunately, there was no constellation to catch me, so it didn't take long for me to reach the top of the room.
Finally, there was a button in front of me. If I press this button, I can stop this tragedy.
But at that moment.
—Are you really going to make all that 'thing' as if it 'never happened'?
There was a voice echoing in my head. It was a voice I knew well.
"Cheon Inho."
—If you press that button, the King of Fear will survive. But all the stories you’ve built will disappear.
I hesitated and asked.
"How do you know that?"
—If you don’t want to believe it, just think of it as the nonsense of the 'Evil Sophist'.
Suddenly, something occurred to me.
The Evil Sophist, Cheon Inho. He was one of the few 'Recorders of Fear' in this 'Fear Realm'. So it wouldn’t be particularly strange if he knew the secrets of this 'Fear Realm'.
—As a recorder, I’ll give you some advice. If you press that button, all the events here will revert to the moment the 'Transcendent Alliance' was created. All the stories you’ve built since entering the 'Fear Realm' will disappear, and the reason you came here will become meaningless. And crucially.
Cheon Inho added with a smirk.
—If you press that button, your survival cannot be guaranteed.
Zeus’s thunder was growing louder.
—The moment you press the button, all impurities that are not necessary for the initial components of the 'Fear Realm' will be removed.
"I can’t believe what you say."
Regardless of whether Cheon Inho’s words were true or false, if you don’t press this button, all the characters in the 'Big House' will die. Kyrgios, Breaking the Sky Swordsmaster, and Cheok Jungyeong will all die.
It was the moment I finally put my hand on the button after taking a deep breath. With a hazy scent brushing my nose, someone grabbed my wrist.
Shining butterfly wings. It was the King of Fear.
His once brilliant wings were more than half torn off, and his body was covered in wounds from weapons.
His skin was horribly protruding.
From his shoulders to his waist, there were traces of Zeus’s lightning striking him, and below, there were scars from Poseidon’s waves. Snowdrops flowed like tears from his tattered feet.
In that state, the King of Fear called me.
<#>【■■-ah.】
He was calling my name, which he had never called before.
<#>【Don't do that.】
Why? His voice sounded normal. For a long time, [Multispecies Communication] was maintained.
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint', is activated.]
Or is this also a function of [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint]?
His inner thoughts, which had been stained with incomprehension, suddenly became clear. Maybe it was because the Fear Realm had come to an end.
It might be evidence that he was no longer the 'King of Fear'.
<#>【Don't press the button.】
I shook my head and shouted.
If I don't press this button, you will die. The people of the Transcendent Alliance and the Outer Gods will all die.
Everything you loved will turn to dust and disappear.
You will be torn to pieces by those damn constellations who want the 'Kim Dokja fragments'.
So this is the only way to protect the 'Fear Realm'.
Return to before I entered this 'Fear Realm', before all the incidents occurred.
Then the King of Terror said.
<#>【No.】
Kim Dokja, who loves the stories of this world more than anyone else, smiled at me and said.
<#>【I like your stories too.】
