<title>773 Episode 34 Sibling (4)
The condition for activating [Time of Judgment] of the Ten Demon Judges is simple.
<&>「Get support from constellations within the same channel.」
The important thing here is that not all 'constellations within the same channel' need to agree.
Unlike the 'Judge of Evil's' [Time of Judgment], which does not activate even if only one of the 'Absolute Good' constellations opposes it, the [Time of Judgment] of the 'Judge of Destruction' can be activated even if only one constellation agrees.
<!>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation (Agent)' has agreed to the activation of the Time of Judgment.]
In other words, [Time of Judgment] can be activated even if there is only one constellation that agrees within the channel.
<!>[The constellation 'Plague Rat' opposes the activation of 'Time of Judgment'!]
<!>[The constellation 'Serpent Cutting Its Tail' opposes the activation of 'Time of Judgment'!]
<!>[The constellation 'dog that threw itself into the flames' opposes the activation of 'Time of Judgment'!]
As expected, there was opposition from the beggars. But there is no use in opposing it.
I agreed, so what are you going to do?
<!>['Time of Judgment' begins!]
<!>[The constellation 'rat that brings plague' opens its eyes!]
<!>[The constellation 'the snake cutting off its tail' cannot hide its embarrassment.]
It felt good to see the astonished constellations, but in fact, it was not a very favorable situation for us.
<&>「The characteristics of the three great judges all have something in common: they borrow the probability of 'constellations'.」
The judge judges the object on behalf of the will of the constellations, and the constellations pay an appropriate probability.
The problem was the probability.
<!>[Currently, there is only one constellation within the channel that has agreed to the time of judgment.]
<!>[There is insufficient probability.]
<!>[The popularity of 'Time of Judgment' is low.]
Since 'Judgment of Ten Demons' is easy to activate [Time of Judgment], its effect greatly depends on the level or number of people who agree to activate the skill.
In short, right now, Jung Heewon could only borrow the probability of the 'Demon King of Salvation (acting agent)'.
Tsk tsk, tsk tsk.
Surely the skill won't end before she even fights properly?
A high-level demon holding the 'Wolgeuk'—the 'Spear Master' muttered while holding Jung Heewon’s collar.
<!>[Interesting. I never thought there would be an incarnation with the 'judge' trait.]
I spoke to that guy using Jung Heewon’s words.
"The level of the Gourmet Association has fallen a lot. They even accept lowly  great-grades like you as  'Gourmet Association' members."
<!>[Are you crazy?]
Looking at his expression, it seemed like I had really touched the point.
I guess so. In fact, these guys are probably not mainstream 'Gourmet Association' members, but rather subcontractors.
For example, this means that these are the people who supply items such as the 'Heart of a 10th Circle Grand Mage' or 'The Right Arm of a Poor Sword Master' that are being eaten up by the Gourmet Association.
<!>[Something like a kid with no background—]
"Are you ignoring the Demon King of Salvation?"
Without hesitation, I put my strength on my back foot. As expected from a born swordsman, her muscle movements were extraordinary.
The 'Spear Master' gave an order as if he was annoyed by the rapidly narrowing distance.
<!>[Block it.]
Two high-level demons who had been loitering in the back stepped forward as if they had been waiting.
<!>[Master of intestines, how dare you order me?]
<!>[I was already planning on eating her!]
One guy seems to have a subspace pouch and appears to be a typical assassin.
And the other one was wearing battle gauntlets, so it was a martial arts style.
It was the assassin who moved first. The guy with his cheeks puffed out like a frog spewed green poisonous smoke, creating a swamp around him.
<!>[Advanced demon 'Filth Addict' activates 'Pollution Zone Lv.10'!]
Filth addict.
Was this guy there too?
This constellation was originally one of the guys who followed Yoo Jonghyuk like a stalker in the middle rounds of 'Ways of Survival'.
His battle logic is to restrict the opponent's movement by laying down a contaminated area and then shoot the enemy with an extremely poisonous needle to subdue the enemy.
<!>[It looks good to squeeze!]
This guy, who likes to hunt prey with minimal injury, had an eccentric hobby of squeezing out freshly caught prey and eating its contents.
Coincidentally, in 'Ways of Survival', there is a scene where Yoo Jonghyuk subdues that guy.
To explain it in Yoo Jonghyuk style, the method is as follows.
<&>「One, do not step on 'contaminated areas' and use protruding tree trunks as a stepping stone.」
Yoo Jonghyuk's 'combat textbook' is difficult for Cheon Inho to follow.
But what about 'Jung Heewon'?
<!>[You’re a quick guy!]
The moment I jumped into the air to avoid the contaminated area, it shot something out of its mouth again.
<&>「Two, avoid the 'extremely poisonous needle' flying from the air.」
An 'extremely poisonous needle' that cuts off half of your combat ability for 10 minutes with just one hit. It was a key skill that allowed the 'filth addict' with low combat power to maintain his position as a constellation.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind' is activated!]
Of course, it doesn't work for me.
The moment the frightened filth addict widened his eyes, I spun around in the air, accelerated, and swung my sword at him.
<!>[Pathetic guy. Go away!]
The one who blocked the sword was a martial arts-style high-level demon who narrowly came forward.
<!>[Advanced demon 'Wingak Taoist' unleashes his power!]
Like the 'Spear Master', he was a constellation from the <First Murim>.
<&>「A person who was once a master in his twenties of the <First Martial Arts>, but sold his clan and martial arts to Seongun and was given the position of 'constellation'.」
Seeing that he is still living as a subcontractor for the 'Gourmet Association', his habits as a human do not change even if he became a Constellation.
<!>[Maesonga, take it! This is the 'Hundred Steps Godly Fists!]
Of course, it wasn't [Hundred Steps Godly Fists]. The real Hundred Steps Godly Fists is not that shabby.
<!>[This is a martial arts skill that brought even the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint to her knees!]
If Breaking the Sky Sword Saint were here, there'll be a sound that would make one's head fly off at once.
But there was no Breaking the Sky Sword Saint here, and it was only Jung Heewon and I who had to deal with him.
In the face of the explosion  of power that took over the place in an instant, I frantically took a step back.
Fast.
No matter how constrained the opponent was by the scenario constraints, a constellation was a constellation, and at one time, he was a strong man who was listed as one of the 20 strongest members of <The First Murim>.
But it's worth a try.
A trajectory that Cheon Inho could not follow was visible.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Kendo Lv.10' is activated!]
Being visible means that there is an opportunity to counterattack as long as the body's abilities are supported.
Gooooooo!
Jung Heewon's [Kendo], which has already surpassed the level 
of transcendence, is filled with the power of swords. A talent who self-taught her sword skills alone and would have undoubtedly competed for the place of the best in the world if she were in the <First Murim>.
The moment the lost guard Kwongak took his breath, Jung Heewon and I were already right in front of him.
<!>[What—]
The sharp sword energy drew a brilliant trajectory to the guy's fist.
<!>[Kaaaaaa—!]
What I can do is utilize all of Jung Heewon's potential while [Time of Judgment] lasts.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Demon Slayer Lv.10' is activated!]
Red natural flowers flickered at the corners of my eyes, and explosive power welled up.
I held 'Mikazuki Munechika' with both hands and swung it again and again.
From top to bottom and from left to right again.
"You—!"
The wrist of the unguarded Kwongak Taoist flew into the air.
I didn't miss the opportunity and attacked his arms.
<!>[Some constellations are astonished by the fighting power of incarnation 'Jung Heewon'!]
The sound of flesh being torn apart.
The panicked Taoist swordsman held onto Munechika Mikazuki's blade with one hand and unleashed a barrage of punches with the other hand.
<!>[You dare!]
There was no place to escape unless I let go of the sword. A blow that would explode one's body with just one hit.
Still, I didn't let go of the sword. I believed in Jung Heewon’s history.
<!>[Exclusive attribute 'Mad Butcher' activates!]
Her indomitable trait that made her enter the '100 Strongest People' of the Ways of Survival came into play.
Kuddddddd!
Jung Heewon’s body was not broken even by the pouring power. The aura surrounding her entire body burned even more fiercely.
The moment the 'Gwongak Taoist' screamed, Jung Heewon's sword moved once again. In addition, it is a sword strike imbued with the ability of [Time of Judgment].
<&>「"I have to become stronger."」
On top of that, there is the time that Jung Heewon has accumulated so far.
<&>「"I have to swing faster and stronger."」
I was able to find out what Jung Heewon was thinking of when practicing swordsmanship.
It was the most beautiful swordsmanship I had ever seen.
<&>「"Only then can I protect Inho-ssi."」
Jung Heewon swung her sword again and again to catch up with him.
<!>[Uh, how could it be that the only human in the scenario is—]
Each and every sword swung like that came together and finally came together at Jung Heewon's fingertips.
A level that an ordinary human being can never reach. A wall that even martial arts masters cannot overcome even after training for hundreds of years.
The wall was crumbling in the face of overwhelming talent.
<&>「Transcendent type level 1.」
A sword made to break the sword of the King.
Her kendo blossomed into a brilliant beam of light, splitting the incarnation body of the 'Wingak Taoist' in half.
<!>[High-ranking demon 'Wingak Taoist' has been killed!]
<!>[The constellation 'Wingak Taoist' receives a terrible shock and leaves the scenario!]
It was impossible.
Even though this is the twentieth scenario, it is a feat in which an incarnation with no sponsor defeats an incarnation possessed by a great-grade constellation.
<!>[The constellations belonging to the Chinese Zodiac are greatly shocked by the power of the incarnation 'Jung Heewon'!]
<!>[The constellations of the Gourmet Association are making interested expressions!]
<!>[A constellation whose modifier has not yet been revealed is watching your battle.]
<!>[5,000 coins were sponsored.]
<!>[The battle of incarnation 'Jung Heewon' is leaked outside the 'Recycling Center' through the management bureau!]
There was no time to get drunk on the joy of victory. Jung Heewon’s body was rapidly becoming heavier.
<!>[There is not enough probability to continue the 'Time of Judgment'.]
<!>[After a while, the reaction of 'madness' will begin.]
Without stopping, I swung my sword at the 'filth addict' next to me.
There are two demons remaining. Before  I couldn’t move her body at all, I had to kill all the remaining guys.
However, the 'filth addict', who foresaw his colleague's defeat, was already running away.
<!>[Damn it! I’ve never heard of such a monster!]
Eventually, there was only one demon left.
<!>[How pathetic. The title 'Gourmet Association' is a waste, Guru Kwon Gak.]
The spear master was glaring at me with cool eyes, as if he wasn't too shaken by my battle.
And the next moment, the spear master’s new form disappeared.
I swung my sword reflexively.
'Mikazuki Munechika' broke with a deep sibilant sound.
The powerful force emitted by the spear master destroyed Jung Heewon's sword and touched the blade of 'Mikazuki Munechika'.
A rapid spear attack followed.
Although it was frustrating, the 'spear master'’s skills were real.
Unlike the Kwongak master who sold out his sect to Seongun and became a 'constellation', this guy was truly a constellation who achieved great feats with his own skills.
In an instant, blood spurted out from the damaged body.
<!>['Time of Judgment' ends.]
To make matters worse, [Time of Judgment] has also ended.
Terrible pain radiated from every bone in my body. All I could really do now was stand.
The spear master was smiling as if he had already secured victory.
<!>[It’s an amazing talent. If you had trained for ten more years, we could have had an interesting match.]
"If it had been one more minute, you would have passed out."
This is it.
By reducing the three high-level demons to one, the goal was achieved.
<!>[I only kept my mouth shut because I thought you were going to die soon.]
The spear master's eyes scanned the entire body of Jung Heewon, whom I had possessed.
<!>[It is a very desirable incarnation. If you want to live, I will give you a chance. If you become my 'incarnation'…]
The expression of the spear master who had been speaking so far hardened.
The reason was clear.
A roar heard from afar. Something was running towards us like a tank, plowing through the forest road.
A pitch-black coat blowing in the wind.
If Han Sooyoung were here, she would definitely have said this.
<&>「"◼️Ba, as expected, the main character."」
I spoke to the high-ranking demon in a triumphant voice, like a fox riding on a tiger's back.
"It’s been a minute, kid."
The eyes of Yoo Jonghyuk, who came running out of breath, were looking in this direction.
It was clear what the guy saw to ran to us.
He must have read the phrase on the 'commercial signal flare' I fired earlier.
<&>「Here is a demon king with your 'spear'.」
'Wolgeuk' is Yoo Jonghyuk’s decisive battle weapon for the 41st round.
From my perspective, it was a stroke of luck that the 'spear master' obtained the Wolgeuk.
"Yoo Jonghyuk! Here we are!"
I shouted with all my might in Jung Heewon’s voice.
"Here is the villain of the world who stole your spear—"
The 'Spear Master' is a monster that should never be dealt with under normal circumstances, but with Yoo Jonghyuk in the '41st round', it was an enemy worth fighting.
If the two of them calmly form a formation to stop them and kill them—
"Yoo Jonghyuk?"
But Yoo Jonghyuk was looking somewhere else without even looking in my direction.
If he had seen that expression on his face, he would definitely have said this.
<&>「"Isn’t that the look you make when you go to buy dumplings and there aren’t any left?"」
