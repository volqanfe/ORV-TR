<title>896 Episode 49 tls123 (6)
That morning was the same as usual.
We woke up at dawn, busily cleaned our faces (Han Sooyoung ordered us to do this), did some light stretching (Han Sooyoung ordered this too), and sat next to each other to eat sandwiches made with reference to Yoo Joonghyuk's recipe from the 81st round (we agreed on this).
"I have a question."
"What?"
Han Sooyoung, who was crunching on a sandwich made with ground pup hind leg meat, glanced at me.
"Even if stretching is like that, is there any point in cleaning our faces?"
"The Constellations are watching."
<!>[The Constellation, 'Maritime War God', nods at the handsome face of the descendant.]
<!>[The Constellation, 'Great King of Beauty', says that the clean incarnation is also nice to look at.]
Honestly, I was impressed. Does this person care about such things even in the Final Scenario?
"They see us even when we haven’t washed?"
"So they’d like it more if we washed."
<!>[The Constellation, 'Commander of the Red Cosmos', nods.]
In the meantime, I’ve become quite attached to the Constellations of the 1,863rd Round.
The Constellations that burn the remaining stories and shine on me.
"Are you ready?"
It’s time to say goodbye to them too.
"Yes."
"What did I teach you?"
"I learned most of it."
For the past 20 days, what Han Sooyoung had been teaching me intensively was how to awaken my potential.
<&>「"You’re already strong enough. You just don’t know how to use your power."」
I briefly told her what had happened in the 41st Round, and after understanding the situation, she advised me this.
<&>「"You don't have to be scared because you're going to fight Myth-grade Constellations. Trust the stories you've built up."」
The enemies I have to fight are Constellations that are comparable to the Three main Gods of <Olympus>.
And maybe the 'Kim Dokjas' who have more fragments than me.
<&>「"If you collect those 'Kim Dokja fragments', you'll get stronger, right?"」
<&>「"Theoretically, yes."」
<&>「"But in my opinion, collecting a lot of fragments isn't necessarily the only way to get stronger. In short, it's like this. The 41st Yoo Joonghyuk isn't necessarily weaker than the 1,863rd Yoo Joonghyuk."」
I listened to her story as if I was possessed.
<&>「"The amount of stories you have is important, but what's more important is how well you understand the stories you have."」
I agreed. I've felt this clearly while fighting the 'Demon King of Salvation' and the 'King of Fear'.
<&>「The total amount of 'Kim Dokja Fragments' that I currently have is close to 30 percent.」
The total amount of fragments that the First and Second had was not much compared to what I had. However, with just that amount of fragments, they showed an influence that shook the <Star Stream>.
In other words, the most important task that I had to solve right now was to 'properly understand' the stories I had.
"[Avatar]?"
"I can't use it yet."
"Hmm."
Despite all the training I've done so far, I still haven't mastered [Avatar].
Han Sooyoung seemed to think it was strange, but she didn't really say anything. It seemed like she thought it was a task that I had to solve in the end.
"You haven't forgotten our promise, have you?"
I nodded.
"We'll go to the 'Last Ark' together and get the Story Core."
"And then?"
"We'll give the 'Story Core' to the winner of this fight."
It was a simple contract. If she gets her hands on the Story Core, she will be able to revive her stuffed comrades in the headquarters’ warehouse.
And if I get my hands on the Story Core, I will be able to safely return to the 41st worldline.
"I won’t let this be the last time, you know?"
"I don’t even want to."
In the meantime, I have fought countless matches with Han Sooyoung. And I have never won against her.
Han Sooyoung, with a dreary smile, aimed her sword at me.
"Then let’s see how much you’ve grown."
A fierce aura rose from Han Sooyoung’s entire body. She pulled out a long sword from her waist.
"That sword…"
I recognized the sword at a glance.
"Is this the first time I’m showing you? This is my main weapon."
She smiled brightly and held a super sword in her right hand.
The weapon that Kim Dokja used when he visited the 1,863rd Round. It seems that Han Sooyoung has been keeping that weapon.
"Come to think of it, Kim Dokja gave you 'Unbreakable Faith'."
Maybe that super sword is now her new 'Faith'.
But her weapon wasn't just one super sword.
Ssssssss.
The hilts on her waist seemed to multiply, and in an instant, her [Avatars] split into six and grabbed a sword each.
The Holy Sword Ascalon.
The Thunder Sword Gram.
The Dragon Sword Ridill.
The Old Dragon Sword Næġling.
The Dragon Slaying Sword Arondight.
They were all swords used to seal the Apocalypse Dragon.
I swallowed as I felt the immense energy flowing from the six holy relics. Han Sooyoung really intended to defeat me here.
"Come."
Before I could finish my words, the blade of the Dragon Slaying Sword moved towards my Adam's apple.
I narrowly avoided the blade and swung my 'Unbreakable Faith'. With a sharp crack, the Thunder Sword Gram and the Dragon Sword Ridill flew in from both sides, aiming for my sides and thighs.
<&>「Way of the Wind.」
<&>「Tenacious Martial Arts Master.」
<&>「'Circulation Delay'.」
<&>「Naggak Breathing.」
The skills, stories, and characteristics within me were simultaneously manifested.
<&>「Storm Wave Fortress.」
As I swiftly rotated my body and extended my sword strike, the Old Dragon Sword Næġling and the Dragon Slaying Sword Arondight flew in from the opposite empty space.
<&>「White Wave Fortress.」
The White and Blue Sword Energy that extended from my sword strike rushed toward Han Sooyoung like a wolf running through the grassland. She said, blocking the consecutive attacks of [Storm Wave Fortress] and [White Wave Fortress] with a concise movement.
"You know that won't work?"
As Han Sooyoung raised her Grass-Cutting Sword, dark clouds gathered in the sky.
The shadow of the eight-headed Imoogi was visible through the dark clouds.
The Eight-Headed Monarch, 'Yamata No Orochi'.
The Grass-Cutting Sword she held was a sword made from the tail of that Yamata No Orochi.
The legend contained in the Grass-Cutting Sword was resonating with her [Black Flame].
That was the true power of the 'Holy Relic'.
"Black Lightning."
The shadow of the Imoogi opened its mouth wide, and its eight heads spit out pitch-black lightning toward the ground.
An incredible wide-range attack reminiscent of Zeus's Thunderbolt.
My mouth fell open without me knowing it, but it wasn't the time to be amazed.
"I am—"
I took in all my breath and spat out into the air.
"The Paradoxical White-Blue, 'Kyrgios Rodgraim'."
A combination of [Incite] and [Bookmark].
When [Electrification] was activated, pure white white-blue lightning enveloped my entire body.
<!>[Your current physical composition is different from that of the corresponding character.]
<!>[You cannot use 'Electrification' with your current physical composition.]
<!>[A powerful skill penalty will consume your body!]
Kyrgios is 'small'. Normally, you would have to receive a penalty due to the different incarnation body composition.
<!>[Your 'strength' overcomes the skill penalty!]
This is only when your 'strength' is lacking.
Kwakwakwakwakwa!
I swung [White-Blue Power] ceaselessly toward the pouring [Black].
Han Sooyoung said with a smile.
"A combination of 「Heir of the Eternal Name」 and [Incite]."
A combination of Kim Dokja's [Bookmark] and Cheon Inho's [Incite].
It was a combination that I had used several times before meeting Han Sooyoung, but it was the first time I had shown it to her.
"And it seems like you were aiming for a 「Stage Effect」 as well, is that right?"
"You're sharp."
I briefly hoped that the 「Stage Effect」 that had defeated Yamata no Orochi in 'Peace Land' would activate, but unfortunately, the stage did not open. It seems that my conditions were somewhat inadequate to satisfy the Stage Effect.
"It's increased quite a bit, but it's still not enough. Do you think you can defeat the Myth-grade Constellations with that much?"
Sparks began to fly from Han Sooyoung's entire body again.
An intense sense of pressure that could be felt just by making eye contact.
It wasn't simply because of the amount of stories she had. It was, so to speak, a difference in interpretation.
A Constellation that understood her own stories better than anyone else. The unique force that the being emitted was pressing down on my entire body.
I was convinced. The Han Sooyoung in front of me right now would never lose even if she were to compete with those terrifying Myth-grade Constellations.
"Black lightning."
The sky in the area turned pitch black and once again, a dark lightning struck the ground.
The lightning was twice as large as before.
I hurriedly swung my sword toward the empty space, but the moment it collided with the lightning, a massive shock swept through my entire body.
A terrible pain that swallowed even my screams. A shock that even [Electrification] could not handle shook my mind. Blood flowed from my clenched lips.
"I—"
I used [Incite] and [Bookmark] at the same time once again.
"I am Kyrgios Rodgraim, the captain of the First Division of the Transcendent Alliance!"
The strongest 'Kyrgios' I know. I [Incited] myself as 'Paradox White-Blue', the leader of the Transcendent Alliance.
<!>[Your understanding of the person is lacking!]
<!>[Your interpretation makes up for your lack of understanding.]
<!>[Your persistent interpretation creates a new understanding of the person!]
Han Sooyoung looked surprised as she watched me rise several times in level in an instant.
No matter how much my interpretation improved, it would take an enormous amount of probability to recreate a 'character' of this level with [Incite] and [Bookmark].
"You told me. Have a good conversation with the 'story' I have."
"Does it make sense for the story to rise in level just by having a conversation?"
Of course it doesn't make sense.
But I was able to do it now.
Because, the 'story' I tried to communicate with the most in the past 20 days was—
<!>[Your 'Giant Tale' is looking at you.]
It was my 'Giant Tale'. A giant tale that has yet to be named. A tale that I don't even know when or why it sprouted in me.
I constantly talked to that story, and found a way to draw some strength from it.
<!>[The possibility that your 'Giant Tale' is lacking is shared.]
First Division Captain Kyrgios Rodgraim, who was hunting the Outer Gods of the Fear Realm.
My incarnation body, which had transformed like a single flash of light, passed through [Black Lightning] and rushed toward Han Sooyoung.
The two swords clashed with a loud noise. Han Sooyoung's sword no longer felt heavy.
<!>[The Constellation, 'Maritime War God', can't take his eyes off your battle!]
<!>[The Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', hurriedly wipes his head!]
<!>[The Constellation, 'Commander of The Red Cosmos', watches the battlefield with anxious eyes.]
In an instant, we exchanged a hundred or so attacks.
Because of the excessive use of power, my whole body was sweating like crazy.
My vision was getting blurry. Nevertheless, my mind was clearer than ever.
<&>「I need one more sentence.」
A single sentence to defeat her.
Han Sooyoung’s eyes were shining brightly as she swung her sword at me. She knew it too. This match would be won by whoever found the 'next sentence' first.
I was the one who moved first.
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.???' is activated!]
"Kim Dokja—"
All I needed was a moment of inattention. And there was only one sentence that could bring about that inattention.
"He likes the novel you wrote!"
I couldn’t tell whether [Incite] had worked or not. However, for a moment, Han Sooyoung's breathing was disturbed, and her sword moved. Her Super Sword rolled on the floor with a dazzling flame.
Han Sooyoung muttered as she watched the swordplay of 'Unbreakable Faith' aimed at her neck.
"Okay..."
I smiled bitterly.
"I lost. The Story Core is yours."
I looked at Han Sooyoung for a moment and then put my sword away, saying.
"No, I will not have the Story Core."
"What?"
In the first place, I had no intention of using the 'Story Core' even if I won.
"Let's go get the 'Story Core' together. Reviving your comrades is the first thing."
Even without using the 'Story Core', there might be a way for me to return to my original worldline. For example, I could make a contract with a 'God of the Outer World' like her.
The conditions and methods would be difficult, but I could definitely find it if I tried.
However, Han Sooyoung's expression was strange. An alarm bell rang in my head along with a strange sense of discomfort.
<&>「Couldn't Han Sooyoung have anticipated this battle?」
No matter how unique the strategy was, the opponent was Han Sooyoung.
Couldn't she have anticipated that I wouldn't take the 'Story Core'?
No, was it logically possible to defeat her with just the cards I had in the first place?
My heart began to beat slowly.
The previous battle quickly replayed in my head.
<&>「She never used [Predictive Plagiarism] while fighting me.」
The fact that she didn't use her specialty, [Predictive Plagiarism], meant that she wasn't in a situation where she could use it. For example,
"Han Sooyoung, Surely—"
Or that the power of [Predictive Plagiarism] had already been used elsewhere.
With a loud noise coming from the sky, I reflexively raised my head.
The destroyed Final Ark. Black dust was rising from the stage of our destination, the 'Last Scenario'.
Along with Han Sooyoung's faint smile, the one sentence she had found echoed in my head.
<!>[Someone cleared the 'Last Scenario'.]
