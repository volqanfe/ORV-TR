<title>664 Episode 20 Reader (6)
The King of No Killing.
In the original work, only Kim Dokja and Selena Kim had this characteristic of a 'king'.
<&>「Dansu ahjussi became the 'King of No Killing'.」
Dansu ahjussi has the characteristics that Kim Dokja had in the original work.
I was extremely happy for ahjussi’s survival, but at the same time, I felt empty and lonely.
What is Kim Dokja doing now?
Is he standing in that snowy field?
Or somewhere I don't know, still reading this story?
If he looks at this story now, what will he say?
"Wake up! It's not over yet!"
The man who was awoken by Killer King's cry opened his eyes.
Killer King suddenly ran over, hugged the man's waist and rolled over.
With a loud noise, the sole of the venomous dragon's foot hit the spot where the man was and crushed it.
"Hey, Inho-ssi! Where are you, Inho-ssi-"
The man looked for me, but I couldn’t answer.
<!>[First-person perspective cannot be activated on this character.]
Perhaps because of the septum from before, it was now impossible to transfer to the man. From now on, Dansu ahjussi must overcome this alone.
"Cheon Inho hasn’t woken up yet. We have to figure it out ourselves."
No, not alone.
Because there are now three complete readers of Kim Dokja’s story.
As if representing my thoughts, Killer King looked around at his companions and opened his mouth.
"We are not Kim Dokja, but we at least have one of Kim Dokja’s attributes."
Killer King added as he glanced at his younger sister and Dansu ahjussi.
"Yerin is [Baekcheonganggi]. You are the [Immortal King]. I have Kim Dokja’s cool-headedness and intelligence."
The last one was a bit strange, but Killer King is definitely the only one I can trust now.
"You can still do it."
The condition of the group was a mess.
Ja Yerin, who had vomited blood several times, could barely stand, and Lee Dansu, who had just been revived, was still unable to come to his senses.
Still, they didn't give up.
"That monster has already recovered a lot of its stamina."
After catching her breath, Yerin opened her mouth.
Could it be that eating the petals of the marigold flower earlier had an effect? The condition of toxicosis, which seemed like she would die soon, had improved considerably.
<!>[After 1 minute, the position of the footrest will be regenerated]
Yerin bit her lip as if she was angry.
"It’s hard for us alone."
Lee Dansu cannot run in one direction, and Ja Yerin can no longer use the [Battle action mode].
Now the only person I can trust is Killer King.
However, Killer King's stamina was also greatly reduced, and he did not have enough strength to finish the fight properly.
"No, there is still a chance."
I also had the same thoughts as Killer King. There is still one more chance left for the party.
The evidence from before was the intermittent vibrations beneath my feet.
The poisonous dragon species that was glaring at my companions also looked around with wary eyes, as if they had noticed it.
The vibration echoed once again.
Then, with a sound as if the edge of the maze was collapsing, a monster reminiscent of a black bull appeared.
<!>[The 6th grade guardian species, 'Labyrinth Sentinel', has appeared!]
The monster with the face of a minotaur and a huge execution axe in one hand was the very monster that Bang Cheolsoo had warned us about before entering the labyrinth.
Judging by the energy it gives off, it is a monster that ranks high among level 6 monsters.
Any number of incarnations would be cut in two just by being touched by that axe.
It was obvious why it had been called here.
'The full flute of provocation'.
An item that provokes all types of monsters.
The grass flute I used earlier even summoned the watchman of the labyrinth at the edge of the maze.
Gooooooo!
The Labyrinth Sentinel let out a harsh roar and broke through the barrier of the closed area.
<!>[6th grade Guardian Bell, 'Labyrinth Sentinel' has recognized the disaster!]
<!>[5th grade poisonous dragon species, 'Lesser Dragon Poisoner' recognized 'Labyrinth Sentinel'.]
The eyes of the two monsters became intertwined in the air.
One side is a fresh grade 6 type. And on the other side a grade 5, that has a deep wound.
In the moment of tension, it was the labyrinth sentinel who rushed in first.
The huge execution ax dug into the poisonous dragon's wing scales, and at the same time, the poisonous dragon's elongated neck bit into the watchman's forearm.
Coo coo coo coo!
The two monsters grabbed each other and rolled around in a cloud of dust.
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is curious about the clash between the monsters.]
<!>[A few constellations are amazed at your wit that made the war happen.]
<!>[Some constellations who like monsters’ wills sponsor you with 500 coins.]
Killer King said in a heavy voice.
"It bought us some time. But the dragon will win in the end."
In fact, the monsters' grappling was quickly gaining momentum.
The entire body of the labyrinth sentinel, who seemed to have an advantage at first glance, was instantly covered in the claw marks of the poisonous dragon species, and soon after, green fluid oozed from the wounds.
The poison of the poisonous dragon species began to eat away at the sentinel's entire body.
"The 'Annihilation' will be activated soon."
Even if the Labyrinth Sentinel holds out, the annihilation will activate after one minute.
In other words, the party must somehow take advantage of this opportunity to defeat the disaster.
Magical power began to gather in Killer King's bowgun.
The supernormal abilities of 'Valkyrie’s Protection' and 'Red Wreath' were fused, and the tip of the arrowhead gave off a red glow.
"All you have to do is hit this one shot."
The three began to approach while the two monster species were fighting.
Their goal is to finish off both monsters with low health at the same time.
And I was watching everything from behind their backs, unable to do anything.
I want to see you a little more.
Even if I can't help their fight, I want to continue to see it, if only to watch it from afar.
<&>「Perhaps Kim Dokja also looks at the world with this feeling.」
But now I had little time left.
The time limit for '3rd person observer view' is approaching.
My body convulsed as I lay on the floor.
A body that has ingested six star gems and is barely able to suppress its transformation into a monster.
When [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] is over, I will be swept up in [madness] again.
Even if the dragon dies and the sentinel dies, the fight will not end.
This fight will only end when someone collects the '7 Star Jewels'.
"Ahjussi."
I looked back for a moment. Shin Yoosoung was talking as if she could see my soul.
"Can I help you?"
The golden glow flowing through Shin Yoosoung’s eyes.
<!>[Incarnation 'Shin Yoosoung' is activating 'multi-species communication'.]
"Say it, ahjussi."
Shin Yoosoung’s small hand was on my chest. Shin Yoosoung’s intentions were being conveyed to me through a faint light.
"If you say one word, I will kill them all."
Now I know too.
Shin Yusung can really do that. Because, [now this 'Shin Yoosoung' does not exist in this world line.]
Shin Yoosoung, who has now been possessed in the 41st round, is the Shin Yoosoung from <Kim Dokja Company> that I know.
But why is 'Shin Yoosoung' trying to help me?
'No.'
Shin Yoosoung’s body trembled.
"Why? Aren’t they important to you?"
'I don't want to see you die here.'
I remember every sentence of this story. I know better than anyone else what kind of place the <Star Stream> is and what the aftereffects of probability are.
In the novel, Kim Dokja goes against probability several times and withstands the odds.
But even after Kim Dokja did such a ridiculous thing, he was able to survive.
The reason  he did it was because he was the main character.
<&>「If Shin Yoosoung uses her power now, Shin Yoosoung will definitely disappear.」
'Please take out the pills in your pocket.'
Shin Yoosoung took out a golden pill from her pocket.
It was a medicinal herb obtained as a reward after defeating Yongdu Ark at Seoul Station.
"Would you like me to feed you?"
Shin Yoosoung crushed the pills with her small hands and put them in my mouth.
Let the pharmacological action of the hwandan occur. My dull face became a little brighter.
My body is now at its limit.
Even if it was this, it was impossible to suddenly improve my state.
But it might give me some energy.
Shin Yoosoung asked with a trembling voice.
"Ahjussi. We’re not going to fight, right? You can’t do it in this state. Your body is already gone."
Then, a sound was heard and the labyrinth sentinel was seen falling in the center of the clearing.
The battle between the monsters is over and the winner has been decided.
The poisonous dragon that bit off the sentinel's body roared into the air.
<!>[Level 5 special species, 'Lesser Dragon Poisoner' prepares to attack!]
And the group moved.
Ja Yerin, who had squeezed out the last of her magical power, cut the Poisoner's ankles with [White Blue Steel].
Lee Dansu who activated [Taming] cleared the cockroaches and disrupted the special attack's vision once again.
Killer King aimed his bowgun at the Lesser Dragon, who lost its balance and collapsed.
"Finish."
Red Wreath and an arrow wrapped with the Valkyries’ supernormal abilities. At the tip of the arrowhead was the 503rd unit that Jophiel was proud of.
An arrow fired leaving a red solid line.
As if waiting for the attack, the poisonous dragon's head was tilted at a strange angle.
Killer King expected even that.
"Scatter away."
The arrowhead exploded right in front of the dragon's head, and the 503rd unit dispersed.
Unit 503, which was fired like a grenade, dug into the dragon’s wounds with fire-attribute energy.
Push shoo shoo shoot!
Drops of green blood burst out like a fountain from the dragon's entire body. The poisonous dragon let out a painful cry.
However, even after receiving the attack, the poisonous dragon did not fall down.
"...Was it not enough?"
I realized how amazing Kim Dokja was when he caught the lesser dragon. Kim Dokja hunted it alone, a disaster that could not be caught even if all of them gathered together.
"Everyone get back!"
As the breath poured out from the poisonous dragon, Killer King also vomited blood from his mouth. Undigested red wreaths littered the floor.
<!>[The 5th level poisonous dragon, 'Lesser Dragon Poisoner' activates 'Death’s Blood'!]
"Find the rash! Quick!"
Flowers began to bloom on the floor.
A hint of despair flashed in Killer King's eyes.
Even if they survived this turn, there was no chance for the party to win now.
Even Dansu ahjussi’s characteristics, Ja Yerin’s [Battle Action Mode], and Killer King's stigmata cannot kill that disaster.
However.
<&>「"Hakhyun."」
I might be able to do it.
<&>「"No matter what, this time tell me a happy story."」
Kim Dokja said so.
A story that makes me happy.
What do I want to talk about?
<&>「"Well done, Heewon."」
Is that a story for the 'extras' who were ignored in the main story?
<&>「"Someone died. Someone died because of this story."」
Or is it a story about as many people as possible surviving?
<&>「"I will prevent the destruction of this world."」
Or, is it a story that does not destroy the 41st turn?
<&>「"Are you really Cheon Inho?"」
I don't know.
Why and for whom am I continuing to tell this story?
<&>「"Why did you decide to write a novel?"」
Someone's voice suddenly came to mind.
That wasn't my memory.
A memory that seems to have flowed from a source older than me.
In that memory, Han Sooyoung was speaking.
<&>「"I don't know. I'll know when I'm done."」
I slowly opened my fist.
Shin Yoosoung realized what I was trying to do and grabbed my wrist.
"Ahjussi, stop. Right now…"
With the sound of tsk tsk tsk, the golden light in Shin Yoosoung’s eyes went out.
In the end, the <Star Stream> intervened. It was expected.
It was unusual that a strong being like Shin Yoosoung intervened in the early part of the scenario in the form of 'possession'.
I muttered to myself towards the fallen Shin Yoosoung.
'Thank you.'
Shin Yoosoung did her job well enough.
From now on, it was up to me.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.9' is activated!]
'Wake up, Cheon Inho.'
Currently, I have activated [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint]. Although I am chained in a soul state, it is possible to use some skills.
Tsutsutsu.
My body stretched out—Cheon Inho's fingers twitched.
'Wake up. Right now.'
<!>[Incite is a skill that moves the target’s unconsciousness.]
In that case, my body may be able to move even without my consciousness.
<!>[The power of the 'star jewel' erodes your body.]
<!>[' Monsterization' occurs.]
<!>['Stage 6 of Madness' is encroaching on you.]
Because my soul was outside my body, I was able to move my body without being affected by [Madness].
Cheon Inho’s body staggered and he stood up. However, Cheon Inho did not take a step straight away. It was as if it was resisting my will.
The pure power of [Incite] alone was not enough. So I decided to do what I always do.
<!>[The sub-skill, 'Sentence Enhancement' is activated!]
<!>[You can enter your actions.]
<!>[The actions you enter will be reinforced.]
<!>[The current enhancement level is level 1.]
<!>[You can increase the reinforcement level by investing stock probability.]
<!>[Current probability: 480.]
Writing sentences.
<&>「Cheon Inho stood up from the floor.」
<!>[10 probability is consumed.]
<&>「The power of 'six star jewels' rose from Cheon Inho’s whole body.」
<!>[10 probability is consumed.]
<&>「Cheon Inho began to stagger and move.」
Every time I added a single sentence, my head felt like it was going to explode.
I don't know how long the [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] state can continue. So I had to get the job done before my body woke up and before I fully regained consciousness.
<&>「Only, Cheon Inho's body was falling apart little by little as he ran with the goal of killing the poisonous dragon species. Signs of becoming a monster appeared and muscles exploded in various places.」
I heard people around me shouting when they found me.
I ignored it and kept moving.
<&>「Cheon Inho risked his life.」
What happens to a soul that loses a body to return to?
Maybe I, too, will go to that theater like other readers.
Or, it may literally become infuriating.
I was scared, but not as scared as I used to be. It may be because I had a glimpse of 'death' with Lee Dansu.
I could see the group finding a foothold in the distance.
A man wearing a white coat was shouting at me.
Ahjussi was not Kim Dokja.
Killer King too. Ja Yerin was also not Kim Dokja.
But if they all work together, they will be able to do what Kim Dokja can do.
They will be able to do things that I cannot do.
<&>「They will see the end of this world.」
My body, which had broken through the rushing breath of the poisonous dragon head on, threw out its fist.
The mighty power of 6 star jewels burrowed into the poisonous dragon's chest.
<&>「Cheon Inho thought.」
I knew it instinctively. Now I only have  one sentence to write. Probability cannot bear any more sentences.
And the words to use were already decided.
<&>「It’s over.」
A probability that you risk your life for.
If this is the case, the <Star Stream> will be satisfied with the story.
<!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' sighs.]
<!>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' cries out!]
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' cannot take his eyes off you!]
<!>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' turns his gaze.]
<!>[Many constellations are truly surprised by your choice.]
If I go back to the snowy field, will I be able to tell Kim Dokja?
<&>「It's over.」
This is him in my story.
<&>「The end.」
For a moment, it felt like time stopped. The surrounding scenery was turning colorless. And.
<&>「The end.」
I closed my eyes.
<&>「It's not the end.」
Something strange was happening.
Someone in front of my eyes.
<&>「It's not the end.」
…was correcting my sentences.
I looked at that sentence and repeated it blankly.
It's not the end.
<!>[Someone edited your sentence.]
<!>[Someone shares your probability.]
Only then did I realize what had happened.
<&>「"But, author. I know this is a meta novel."」
A memory came to mind amidst the throbbing headache.
<&>「"Do readers really want to become Kim Dokja? Isn't that just the writer's greed as a 'writer'?"」
In that memory, she was looking at the manuscript I had written.
<&>「"So, my opinion as a reader."」
Maybe someone who understands this story better than me.
<&>「"As expected, Kim Dokja must be revived."」
My editor.
<&>「"The Kim Dokja we know."」
<!>['Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is unlocked.]
With terrible pain, my soul was sucked back into Cheon Inho’s body.
My heart was beating rapidly, and my mind, swept away by the effects of [madness], swayed precariously like a sailboat on the waves.
<!>[The constellation 'Lotus Flower Blooming Under the Moonlight' looks to you.]
With deep breathing, the terrible pain subsided little by little. Someone was alleviating my pain.
Who is it? I can't see their face.
"Author."
However, someone was holding me in their arms and talking. I heard that voice in my consciousness that was gradually becoming distant.
"Write again."
Yes, I will. I answered.
