<!>[Select the type of dungeon to enter.]

* 7-person dungeon - Yongjun's Jang

The group of three, including Kim Dokja, arrived here in the main part of the book, and they chose the '3-person dungeon', the 'Acupuncturists' Field'.
Anyway, since I was alone, I had no other options.
"I will choose the one-man dungeon, the Field of Nagak."
<!>[You enter the 1-person dungeon.]
Little information was known about the Field of Nagak.
I checked the 'Ways of Survival' skill and the notes I had written, but nothing came to mind right away.
I can’t help it.
This time, I have to experience it for myself.
<!>[You are the 5th to enter the single-person dungeon.]
At the same time as entering, the 'Ever-Changing Stealth Suit' was deactivated. Because from now on, there was no need to make my body smaller.
The Nagak's field was like a huge terrarium that someone artificially decorated.
The rocky land rose between the puddles that submerge people up to the chin.
Hermit crabs about 1 meter tall were also seen creeping and crawling over the land.
Those must be 'Nagaks'.
<!>[If you defeat more than 100 'Nagak', you will be eligible to escape the dungeon.]
<!>[Obtain 2 Sangpyeong Tongbo as a basic reward for every 100 Nagak hunts.]
In order to enter the 'Chapter of the Big Dipper' where the sword of death lies, you must collect 10 Sangpyeong Tongbo.
In other words, I have to catch at least 500 Nagaks.
As I moved slowly, the nagaks who felt my presence turned their antennae all at once.
<!>[The 8th grade sea species 'Small Nagak' has noticed your presence!]
I still don't know the attack pattern of these guys.
However, I know what kind of instrument a 'Nagak' is. A brass instrument made from conch shells.
According to my guess, their attack method is-
<!>[The Nagak Ensemble begins.]
Ugh, I feel like the air is boiling.
I instinctively looked left and right, then took about twenty steps to the left.
And after a while.
Woo woo woo woo.
There was a deafening roar as if dozens of herds of bison were vomiting at once. I could see the floor on which I had been standing until the moment it was turned into clay with a sound.
As expected, it was an attack using sound.
Fortunately, they did not continue. The monsters stopped crying all at once, probably sucking in their breath to make the sound again.
I started hunting them.
When I approached in an instant and took out 'Broken Faith', the surprised hermit crab tried to defend itself by sticking out a small claw crab.
<!>[The 'Blade of Faith' is activated!]
However, there is no way that an ether blade can be blocked with only a 8th class sea monster's carapace.
While the Nagak, whose claw had been cut off, vomited a sound, I inserted a new sword into the gap in the Nagak.
<!>[You have hunted 1 'Nagak'.]
After learning how to hunt one, it was easy.
Avoiding the 'Nagak ensemble' pouring out at regular intervals, I ran between the conch shells.
Every time I swing the Blade of Faith, one Nagak loses its life.
<!>[You have hunted 23 'Nagaks'.]
<!>[You have hunted 24 'Nagaks'.]
If I feel a little bit out of magic, I bought from the dokkaebi’s bag in advance.
I also used an intermediate magic recovery potion.
<!>[You have hunted 152 'Nagaks'.]
<!>[You have hunted 153 'Nagaks'.]
I didn’t forget to look around to see if there were other incarnations around me.
There weren’t.
Occasionally I could see gear or clothing dropped by people, but I couldn't find a living person.
It was definitely difficult for a single player dungeon.
Defeating hundreds of Nagak and obtaining a notification of the award must be a formidable task for ordinary incarnations.
<!>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' rejoices in your growth.]
<!>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' says that he has caught on to his income.]
<!>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' says he heard that the horn meat is good for hair loss and strengthening stamina.]
<!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband asks if that's true.]
The messages of the constellations came into my head.
After defeating the ark at Seoul Station, I felt that the number of constellations permanently residing in the channel increased.
Of course, not everyone in the neighborhood cheered me on, but...
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' complains that it is not fun because there is no crisis.]
In any case, it was around the time that the number of Nagaks I hunted exceeded 400.
<!>[The constellation that has not revealed their modifier warns you that it is not going to be an easy dungeon.]
With a somewhat ominous message, a light vibration occurred throughout the terrarium.
<!>[The number of slaughtered 'Nagak' in the 'Nagak’s Field' has exceeded 400!]
<!>[Someone is very angry at the Nagaks’ death!]
<!>[Higher seawater species appear!]
I saw something rise up in the huge puddle that occupied the center of the 'Nagaks’ Field'.
It was a huge conch shell with a height the size of a small house.
<!>[6th sea species, Ancient Nagak has awakened!]
It's not even 7th grade, it's suddenly 6th grade?
At this point, if it was a 6th sea species, it was not easy to deal for even Jung Heewon who has activated [Time of Judgment].
A tingling feeling of life was transmitted through the hair on my forearm.
Should I run away now?
<!>[Penalty for high-ranking sea species is activated!]
<!>[You cannot escape from the dungeon for the next 10 minutes.]
Unable to escape for 10 minutes.
In other words, if I manage to survive for 10 minutes, I can escape.
<!>[A handful of constellations are now licking their lips saying that it will be a little fun.]
The ancient Nagak twisted its massive body, and before I knew it, his antennae was pointing toward me.
<!>[6th sea species 'Ancient Nagak' has noticed your presence.]
I swallowed lightly and thought.
<&>「To what extent can I fight now?」
Come to think of it, I wasn't that weak.
I got my first story just before the fourth scenario was over, and I raised my overall ability to the limit of the scenario.
There is no 'Unbreakable Faith', but there is 'Broken Faith' that can be infinitely regenerated with 'Thought', and I can use [white and blue steel]. The 'outer suit' obtained in the theater dungeon is still intact.
<!>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' says that the meat of the Ancient Nagak is in the limelight as a food to prevent hair loss.]
<!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' asks if it's real.]
<!>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' bets his hair and says it's real.]
<!>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' says that this 'Bald General of Justice'has never eaten Nagaks’ meat.]
…
<!>[A new bounty scenario has arrived!]

I stared blankly at the newly appeared scenario window and suddenly came to my senses.
It was an unexpected opportunity.
Even a 'Bounty Scenario' directly imposed by the Prisoner of the Golden Headband.
If it was Kim Dokja, he would never have missed this opportunity.
After making a light call, I fixed my 'Broken Faith'.
Let's try it.
Because I already know how to attack Nagaks.
Without giving me more time, I ran towards the 'Ancient Nagak'. The plan was to activate the 'blade of faith' with maximum output immediately, and cut down its skin at once.
However.
Quadddeuk!
Surprisingly, the shell of the 6th grade Sea Species deflected the 'Blade of Faith'.
Strong enough to block the ether blade. The moment I took a few steps in my panic, I heard an ominous vibration.
The 'ensemble' of the ancient Nagak is about to begin.
I quickly stepped back and searched for a place out of reach of sound waves.
A cold sweat ran down my back.
I could feel it instinctively. The ensemble of the 'Ancient Nagak' had a different attack range than the other Nagaks.
I could see the Ancient Nagak tally swaying as if mocking me.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
A huge circular sound wave was emitted from the Ancient Nagak as the center. I reflexively turned my back and ran away.
I had to run as far as possible, to a place where those sound waves couldn't reach.
Bubbeobuck!
But the sound was faster than my steps.
Even though I retreated to the point where the sound wave weakened, it felt like I was getting a concussion the moment I got hit. I felt sick to my stomach and felt nauseous. In the distance, I saw two Ancient Nagaks swaying.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World' is activated!]
This time, Ways of Survival was activated just in time.
<&>「"There’s an easy way to hunt ancient nagak."」
Those were the words of Yoo Joonghyuk, without a doubt, another sentence of 'Ways of Survival' came to mind next.
<&>「"You can't avoid his ensemble attack even if you cover your ears."」
I already know. I just had my ears covered.
<&>「"The attack method is simple."」
As expected, our regressor protagonist seemed to know the strategy of hunting an 'Ancient Nagak'.
<&>「"Just before he opens his mouth for an ensemble."」
Before opening its mouth?
<&>「"Run faster than the speed of sound and cut it in half with a powerful punch."」
Did I hear it wrong?
I rolled on the floor mindlessly avoiding the 'Nagak’s Ensemble'.
<&>「"There is an easier way."」
Fortunately, that was not the end of Yoo Joonghyuk’s words.
<&>「"All you have to do is hit its shell with the [Pacheonbuk Fist] that has reached its climax. No matter how hard the shell is, it can't handle the impact of the mesosphere."」
Yoo Joonghyuk’s unlucky smile came to life before my eyes.
<&>「"It’s a basic strategy that anyone can do."」
I can understand why Kim Dokja hit Yoo Joonghyuk in the back of the head at every opportunity.
When I came to my senses, I was surrounded by miniature Nagaks.
There is no place to avoid the next attack.
In the distance, the second ensemble of 'Ancient Nagak' was about to begin.
What should i do?
Can I use the 'Shield of Hercules'? [Air Area Defense] works against sword attacks. Can I defend?
Or not-
"This way."
A human voice came from somewhere.
When I turned my head, a small hand was fidgeting between the shells of the 'Nagak' from a few steps away.
The owner of the hand raised the shell while walking, and poked her head out through a small gap.
"Here. Come in here."
The moment I checked the child's face, I felt like my heart stopped.
Why is this child here?
Yoo Joonghyuk’s voice echoed in my head.
<&>「"Of course, I don’t bother to get my hands dirty hunting something like 'Nagaks'."」
In the distance, the ancient trumpets of horns resounded, and the wind blew the wavy hair of the child.
Brilliant light brown hair.
It was a child I knew well.
"Ahjussi."
The fifth member of <Kim Dokja’s Company> I met.
The first incarnation of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.
"Quickly. Come in!"
A child who will go through the most terrible things in this 41st turn.
An incarnation that finally becomes a disaster in another world line.
<&>「"Take care of it, Beast Lord."」
Disaster of Floods—Shin Yoosoung was there.
