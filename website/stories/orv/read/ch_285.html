            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 285: Ep. 54 - Demon King Slayer, I</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The most imaginative thing I've ever read was Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–What if Ways of Survival became a reality?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps anyone would've imagined such a thing with their favourite novel. I did as well. Maybe it was due to the endless imaginations in my youth that I was able to adapt to Ways of Survival. Once the scenario started, I would do this first and then do this. This hidden piece would be obtained…</p>
<p class="orv_line">During middle school, I even drew charts in the corner of my textbook.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Yoo Joonghyuk: A professional gamer, an awful personality, a psychopath, kills if words don't work (sometimes just kills), have to unconditionally bring him to my side, humanity still remains in the third round…</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had been glad when I first realized I had fallen into the third round of Ways of Survival.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I came to a world I could change and thought it was really fortunate. If I had fallen into the last round…</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Kim Dok ja thou ght. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was no existence that could stop him.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Sh―it. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted with all my strength as I saw the blade flying towards me.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Wait! Stop! I said stop!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A person who regressed more than a thousand times. A spirit that had become insensitive from the hundreds of suicides and tragedies that an individual could suffer. The extremely widespread regression depression…</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Yoo Joonghyuk of the 1863rd round is the despair of the world itself. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I acted the moment the blade was about to pass through my neck.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The special skill 'Miniaturization Lv. 10' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My body shrank in an instant and the blade passed through the air. The man's startled eyes were seen from over the blade. This damn guy. Did he think I came here to die? This might be the 1863rd round but he was mistaken if he thought I would obediently die.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Electrification' Lv. 12 (+2) has been activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I knew I wasn't his opponent. However, I still had to try my best. My body moved at lightning speed as I yelled, "Son of a bitch! You have to let me talk to you!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The indirect messages poured from the air along with my cry.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations have noticed your presence!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Adventurer who Stands Up an Egg' is interested in your appearance.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations 'King of Ephemera' is interested in the fight between you and 'Iron Blood Supreme King'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations feel strong jealousy towards you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[1,000 coins have been sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 95th scenario of the 1863rd regression. The world might be like this but there were still constellations giving donations. The nature of the sponsorship was a bit different but…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me with a stiff expression. "The Baekchung School? Strange. I'm sure he is out of action in this round…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">This person's brain circuits had become twisted after over 1,000 regressions. He would've finished judging whether to kill or spare me based on the actions I had shown so far. It was scary.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was because I was afraid that I had to read it now. Thus, I could get out of this situation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have an insufficient understanding of the person and can't activate the second stage!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' stage 1 has been activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…I lacked understanding. My pride was a bit hurt but I thought it would be like this. This was Yoo Joonghyuk of the 1863rd round, not the Yoo Joonghyuk I knew. It might just be the first stage but I had to invoke it. I might not be able to read the details but even knowing the attack direction would help.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Neck. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment that Yoo Joonghyuk's thought was transmitted, I withdrew with all my might.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even this guy wouldn't be able to easily catch me. It was because I was now using Way of the Wind and Electrification.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Keok?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't know if I had turned my body first or the dark shadow had moved ahead of me first. My breath was blocked and my vision darkened. It was a feast of magic power that seemed to hurt my whole body. I flew through the air like an electrocuted fish. A tremendous amount of magic power shook my body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations are laughing at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was the face of Yoo Joonghyuk that was seen in front of me. His hands were crushing my torso. My neck hurt like it was broken as it was held between thumb and index finger.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't believe it. This might be the Yoo Joonghyuk of the last regression but how could he catch me so easily when I used Electrification?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will ask you a final time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized the moment I heard his cold and apathetic voice. It was stupid to think I could avoid it by knowing the direction in advance. The person in front of me wasn't the young Yoo Joonghyuk of the third round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Where is the dragon sword, Arondight?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">…How could I speak when he was holding my neck?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I see Lancelot's incarnation body here so you must surely know…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ah, the constellation who just died was Lancelot? Shit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you don't answer, I will have to force it out of you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes shone with a golden light. As a matter of fact, Yoo Joonghyuk's foundations remained unchanged, whether it was the third or 1863rd regression.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used Sage's Eye Lv. ???!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After over one thousand regressions, his Sage's Eye had reached a formidable level. Perhaps the only being he can't see with those eyes now is a god from another world who has lived for a longer period of time than Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill Fourth Wall has blocked Sage's Eye!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Yoo Joonghyuk's Sage's Eye focused on my body, the wall moved. The Fourth Wall stood firmly in front of the persistent gaze that didn't want to miss a single piece of information. There were stronger sparks than when I had encountered the Unidentified Wall.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 No t bad. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This time, the Fourth Wall looked formidable. At this point, I couldn't tell if the Fourth Wall or Yoo Joonghyuk was the great one. The Fourth Wall didn't back down and Yoo Joonghyuk didn't give up. It was me who was fried between them. It was so painful that I couldn't scream, even with my true voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kuek…?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk raised his power first. The collision was so strong that golden circles swirled in his eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is feeling a competitive spirit.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is showing great hostility towards you!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This was a barrier that couldn't be penetrated even with Sage's Eye. Once again, I realized what a great skill Fourth Wall was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then something strange happened. The Fourth Wall was able to prevent Sage's Eye and started to flow like water over Yoo Joonghyuk's hand. The typed letters covered his body like insects and for the first time, Yoo Joonghyuk sounded disconcerted. "What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wriggling letters became memories that flowed like a panorama. They were my memories of the third round that were recorded on the Fourth Wall.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Get your hand off me and get lost, you damn jerk!" 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Maybe not. In any case, I am hopeful about the situation."<br>"…What is so hopeful about it?"<br>"Joonghyuk-ah, we can save the world. You know that, right?" 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The name of our nebula is… Kim Dokja's Company…"<br>"There isn't a name yet. In addition, we will gain the supporters now." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't comprehend the memories in front of him. They were all things that didn't exist in this round. The sparks that almost blinded me eased and Yoo Joonghyuk's expression became clearer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you…?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The '1863rd round' made an astonished expression. As if the situation was funny, a voice from the fourth wall was heard in my head.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I did we ll Kim Dok ja. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Did it do well?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Tell me. What is this? I'll tear you apart if you don't say it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">What did it do well? Shit.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kuek… no, wait! I need some time to answer!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I exploded the blue-white energy as I was held in Yoo Joonghyuk's hands. It was a struggle to somehow escape from the guy's grasp. It might be too much, but at least I have to buy some time until I can borrow the power of the 'Giant Story'…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then something unexpected happened. There was an explosion and Yoo Joonghyuk missed me. There was a surprised and confused expression. Yoo Joonghyuk reached out with sluggish movements. I wanted to know what happened but I couldn't miss the opportunity I had just gained.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind Lv. 11 (+1) is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Way of the Wind was activated and the blue-white energy made a trail through the air. I thought he would chase after me quickly but I didn't feel Yoo Joonghyuk right away. I looked back and saw an unexpected sight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…What was this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I had the question, a deafening true voice echoed in the expanse.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Yoo Joonghyuk! I will repay the grudge of Immeasurable Austerity!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Red and blue eyes glared from the roof of a nearby building. Two black panthers with slender, streamlined bodies were falling toward Yoo Joonghyuk, emitting a powerful roar.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The demon king 'Devil of Easiness and Atrocity' is showing hostility towards incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The demon king 'Eyes that See the Forbidden' is showing his teeth to incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk of the 1863rd round was stronger than anyone else but he had many enemies. Thanks to this, I could identify the two leopards without much difficulty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Devil of Easiness and Atrocity, Ose. Eyes that See the Forbidden, Flauros. They were the 57th and 64th demon kings of the Demon Realm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prideful demon kings forgot their shame and unleashed a pincer attack towards an incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, it wasn't shameful.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Demon King Slayer! Your story will end here!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Right now, Yoo Joonghyuk was an existence full of value. I buried myself in the rubble as there was a deafening roar. Then I carefully watched the situation. It was a clash I couldn't afford and I thought I should move away, but I had a desire to watch the fight a bit more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't another fight but the fight of the 1863rd round Yoo Joonghyuk. It wasn't easy to see. My ears seemed to burst and the battle began.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations are enthusiastic about the battle of incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Indirect messages poured out as Yoo Joonghyuk pulled out his sword. It was the Splitting the Sky Sword that was already broken in the third round. The blade had gone through a number of scenarios and had been upgraded to a completely new level, shining brightly in the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The demon kings facing him also revealed their power.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Creatures, rise from death!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The dead earls and dukes of the Demon Realm became undead and emerged from the ground. They held elite objects that preserved the combat power of their lives.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't panicked at all. "It is Summoning the Dead? The Devil of Principles also used it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk was smiling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That bastard's body is now hanging among the dead constellations."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Shut up!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A light flashed and Yoo Joonghyuk's sword moved. What should I call this swordsmanship?</p>
<p class="orv_line">…Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship? I didn't know. The certain thing was that it was an amazingly beautiful swordsmanship. It was also a surprisingly cruel swordsmanship.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The nobles of the demon world were cut by the sword and screamed as they turned to ash. They were high-ranking dukes comparable to historical-grade constellations. Such beings exploded with a few swings of the sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In less than a minute, Yoo Joonghyuk killed dozens of undead nobles and reached the nose of Flauros.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[How…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Like a toy, the head of Demon King Flauros exploded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were no emotions in his eyes. There was a single blow with a sweet smile. Yoo Joonghyuk killed a demon king.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[This… this crazy bastard!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King Ose shouted angrily.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Constellations! Why are you hesitating?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the call was heard, the constellations hiding in the ruins came out. Most of them were constellations of the absolute evil system. They ranged from historical-grade to narrative-grade. Every constellation rushed to get rid of one incarnation, Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is talking about the story of 'Hell of Eternity…']</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't pushed at all. A bloody aura overflowed from his body and collided with the constellations. It was a scary and powerful force but the blow was calm and full of moderation. Every time Yoo Joonghyuk's sword moved, the ranks of the constellations shook helplessly.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations of the absolute evil system hate the incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnation bodies of the constellations exploded one by one. The high-ranking constellations could look so shabby. There were no signs of impatience as Yoo Joonghyuk continued the battle.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is talking about the giant story 'Lonely Pilgrim of Destruction'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk was only using his 'left arm' to destroy the constellations. Every time a constellation fell, my arms trembled.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations of the absolute evil system are shocked by the combat ability of incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Hatred became shock.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations of the absolute evil system are afraid of the incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Shock became fear.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations are trembling at the power of incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was thrilling. Crazy guy… he was a really crazy guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how I thought about it, there was no way to bring down the current Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't know what scenario Secretive Plotter gave me but I must never become enemies with this guy until it was over.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then a message was heard.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The sub scenario commissioned by 'Secretive Plotter' has arrived!]</p></div>
