            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 136: Ep. 26 - Scenario Destroyer, VI</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">I doubted my ears for a moment. This bastard Yoo Joonghyuk… What did he say just now?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' appears late and looks around.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' explains the situation while snickering.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is astonished.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is desperately praying for the line to be spoken again.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana asked again like he couldn't believe it. "Just now…"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' likes this relationship triangle.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has sponsored you 2,000 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What damn relationship triangle? When I saw Nirvana's face grow pale, it hit me that things were going sideways. I was in the middle of putting together a good plan dammit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said, "Hey, what bullshit is that? We aren't companions?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk replied with a blank expression. "I wasn't talking about you specifically…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, regardless of what Yoo Joonghyuk's intentions were, the situation was already worsening. With trembling lips, Nirvana spat out his passionate fury in a shaking voice, "How could it not be me…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A fearsome killing intent was released from Nirvana's body and a huge mandala appeared behind him.</p>
<div class="orv_image"><img src="../../../assets/images/136 - A fearsome killing intent was released from Nirvana's body and a huge mandala appeared behind him.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></div>
<div class="orv_notice"><p>* Official novel illustration (canonical)</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I instinctively took a few steps back. Why were the people around Yoo Joonghyuk always so anxious to be acknowledged as companions? I wouldn't mind giving this jerk to them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How, how could you become one with someone that isn't me?!" A dazzling light exploded from Nirvana's mandala.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I urgently whispered towards Yoo Joonghyuk. "Hey, just say that you like him too. Quickly."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't want to."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why not? Listen, just close your eyes and get it over with…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana was spitting with rage at my whispering. "Don't whisper in front of me!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then Yoo Joonghyuk spoke in a loud voice, "I'm not interested in men!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is howling while spitting up blood.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[2,000 coins have been sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana looked like he was also going to spit blood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am not a man!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is taken aback.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Of course, I'm not a woman either!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an absolute disaster. I was annoyed seeing the wave of magic power that was growing stronger with Nirvana's passion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you doing? Just say you like him! You can use him later…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He is too dangerous."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shit, that damn pride. Nirvana's combat power was expected to be at least on par with Yoo Joonghyuk's. On top of that, if all the members of the Salvation Church joined in, then victory was not certain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please, wait!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, I stepped forward and opened my mouth. A reincarnator was a card that could be useful in future situations. There was no need to fight against him here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There seems to be a misunderstanding, so let's talk."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Nirvana Moebius' has lost his sense of reason.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"We have no intention of being hostile to the Salvation Church. He just isn't good at expressing himself…" I put on a show while deliberately bumping Yoo Joonghyuk's shoulder. "In fact, we were also considering whether we should join you as subordinates, Church Leader. Let's throw away the future and live for the present! How good would that be? Joonghyuk-ah, don't you also think so?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I didn't actually agree with the doctrines. In the world of the Star Stream, if you threw away the future and lived in the present, then you'd just die in the present. And even if I was a bit less happy, I wanted to live longer. That's why I was a slave to capitalism.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Really? Answer, Yoo Joonghyuk!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe since he ate up my acting, Nirvana's fierce aura gradually declined, but Yoo Joonghyuk didn't help. "It's nonsense."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, wait a minute!" I shouted but it was already too late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana gritted his teeth. "Indeed, so it's like this. Then you can go to hell together!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I used Bookmark the moment Nirvana moved.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Bookmark skill is currently updating.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Replacing old bookmarks with new bookmarks.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are five minutes left until the bookmarks replacement is complete.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What? Now of all times? Meanwhile, Nirvana had accelerated to right before my nose. It was fast, as if he was using Way of the Wind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…Wait, this really was Way of the Wind? I belatedly recalled that he was an Imyuntar in a past life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk stepped in front of me. Nirvana's mandala and Yoo Joonghyuk's Splitting the Sky Sword collided, emitting a sound like a building was exploding.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana said, "What a touching friendship. So you think of your companion first, is that it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja, stay back! This person…!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Unfortunately, however." Nirvana's words were faster. Not just his words, his actions were faster too. "Your companion will die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana chanted a spell and Yoo Joonghyuk's body stiffened like a stone statue.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Nirvana Moebius' has used the stigma Eternal Nightmare Lv. 8.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I knew this skill. It was the most lethal technique against Yoo Joonghyuk. Sparks flew around the hardened body of Yoo Joonghyuk. Like a broken robot, Yoo Joonghyuk's neck froze as he turned back to me. Although he was looking at me, his eyes weren't truly seeing me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">R…un… aw…ay.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk was currently trapped in a prison of his most terrible trauma. A horrible prison where one memory was repeatedly played. It was a mental skill that was a level higher than the skill used by the boss of the Theatre Dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Come here, cheeky person who was reborn."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana had the highest level mental skill to dig into the gap in Yoo Joonghyuk's weakness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an incredible feat. However, a reincarnator was still affected by probability. It was impossible for him to have such strength at this point. I stared at Nirvana's slender muscles.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will make you holy."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did he abandon everything physical and invest everything in the mental system and acceleration? This was the only thing that made sense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana raised a counter skill just for Yoo Joonghyuk, who had a weak mental state. It was unknown about other existences but he couldn't lose against Yoo Joonghyuk. By the way, how did he get the exact right skill? Unless someone else gave him the information…</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Run away!" Min Jiwon and the Hwarang blocked the incoming Nirvana. She didn't back down in front of the person who could even stop Yoo Joonghyuk. "Quickly! There is no hope in Seoul if you die!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"King of Beauty." Nirvana smiled happily at the sight of Min Jiwon. "Last time you ran away well but now you seem inspired by my thoughts!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The two of them had already met.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You knew you were going to die and realized something? Humans really have to live in the present. Humanity is all about the present."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Min Jiwon shouted at me, "Go quickly! It is too much for you alone! If you are with Yoo Sangah-ssi and Jung Heewon-ssi…!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana moved before the King of Beauty's words finished. More than a dozen Hwarang flocked to Nirvana but they weren't a match for him in the first place. Nirvana touched the forehead of the Hwarang and they collapsed on the spot. It was the use of Thought Infection.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"U-Uwah, uwahh!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Hwarang collapsed and started to scream with pain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Life is hell!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Along with the screams, the shouts of the Salvation members were heard from the rear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Die for the present!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Today is the only place where we can live!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The members recited threats and sprang towards the Hwarang. As I looked at the Salvation members, Nirvana was already reaching towards the King of Beauty's forehead. "Don't worry, King of Beauty. I like pretty existences."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"U-Uhhhh…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thus, I won't kill you."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Nirvana Moebius' has used Thought Infection Lv. 9.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A white aura stretched from Nirvana and started to wriggle around Min Jiwon. Like tentacles, the aura stems pierced her body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Accept your present."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't want to! I don't want to…!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The hidden desires of the King of Beauty were pouring out thanks to this aura. Nirvana laughed at her desires.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You want to go to a luxurious spa while your companions are dying? Foolish woman."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"N-No. I…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You just want to enjoy a splendid life. You still haven't forgotten the days when you were an actor. Thus, you became a king."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana was enjoying himself greatly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Accept your desires. Admit that you have such sick thoughts while your companions are dying! That is what a human is. If you deny your desires then you are nothing."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The king of Beauty's eyes gradually became cloudy. It was a skill that violently convinced a person of their own desires and forced their time into the 'present'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the process of joining the 'Salvation Church'. Dammit, Bookmark was still…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Bookmark update has been completed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That's it!</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The update has increased the efficiency of the bookmarks by 20%.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I activated Bookmark.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind Lv. 9' has been activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I stepped on the wind and flew through the air. The increased bookmark efficiency raised the level of Way of the Wind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Okay, then there might be a chance of victory. I swung Blade of Faith towards the confused Nirvana. Nirvana managed to avoid my blade but it was a close call.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I raised Min Jiwon. "Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah, ah…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana, who retreated, was once again flying towards me. Light flowed from the mandala into his grip.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung the Blade of Faith. Sparks flashed and my hands hurt, but I held on more than I expected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Like Yoo Joonghyuk's Transmission, the reincarnator had a similar Succession skill. It allowed him to inherit skills from his past life. As I expected, this person focused more on mental abilities and speed than close combat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How can you use Way of the Wind? It can't be…" Nirvana frowned as he blocked my blade. "Are you the one the 'neutral' guy mentioned?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm a bit famous?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Impertinent fellow!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana once again collided with the Blade of Faith. Then a white aura was emitted from the mandala.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Nirvana Moebius' has used Thought Infection Lv. 9.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It appeared like expected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Now die! Accept your fate!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana's white aura shot towards me but I didn't avoid it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Human beings aren't slaves of desire. They are animals fighting their desires."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The white aura digging into me melted away in an instant. I'm sorry but your thoughts would never eat at me. It was because my 'present' wasn't here.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Fourth Wall has completely invalidated the effects of Thought Infection.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I rushed to the astonished Nirvana.</p>
