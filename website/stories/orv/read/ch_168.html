            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 168: Ep. 32 - Kim Dokja's Love, VII</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellation who doesn't yet have a name. Shin Yoosung was well aware of who it was referring to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Ahjussi'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was only a gaze but in fact, many people died because there wasn't a 'gaze' at an important moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that sense, Shin Yoosung was lucky.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name is nodding.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosung received the attention of only one person in the world and stepped forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She could do it. Her legs were numb and her lips couldn't move, but she was convinced.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One step, another step.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The child's small hands soon reached the outer shell of the monster. There was a very small wound on the outer shell. The startled monster's eyes shone. Shin Yoosung stared straight at the monster rather than avoid the monster's eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Look straight at me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking closer, it wasn't just one wound. Numerous scars were covering the outer shell of the monster's entire body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The monster let out a small cry. Perhaps no one had seen its wounds before. The cuts were created a long time ago. These wounds were the very existence of this monster. Due to these wounds, the monster became stronger but it also became lonely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosung's face distorted as if she vividly felt the pain. "You shouldn't be a monster just because you are hurt."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosung slowly touched the monster's injuries. However, they were wounds that couldn't be healed no matter how long passed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That didn't mean she would give up. There would be a miracle. Just like Kim Dokja saved the 41st regression Shin Yoosung. Even those who couldn't be healed could be saved.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosung saw the roots of the Perpetual Motion that pushed down on the monster. Perhaps this monster had been tied up in this place for a lifetime.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosung pulled out a golden fruit.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Ancient Beast's Fruit.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was the SSS-grade item that emerged from the random box Kim Dokja had given to her one day. It was a consumable item that could be used to tame an historical-grade monster that couldn't be tamed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She slowly bowed to the monster and said, "Let's go together."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like Paradise was experiencing an earthquake and Reinheit shouted in a baffled manner.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Keuk, kuheok, w-what is this…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Perpetual Motion suddenly collapsed. Little by little, the plant's branches and leaves were wilting. The supplied energy was drifting to a distant place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the time Reinheit realized something was wrong, the branches in the air were already breaking.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kuheeeeok! H-How? How can…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Reinheit started vomiting. Sap poured out like it was blood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something was eating at the base of the Perpetual Motion. As the eerie teeth penetrated the sharp roots, Reinheit screamed like his body was being torn apart. The being tied to the roots of Paradise for a long time was now destroying the roots.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Perpetual Motion lost power and started to collapse.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[N-No. No…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Something huge exploded from under the ground. It didn't have a rating because it had never been revealed to the world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It had a huge dragon's body, a demon's wings and the eyes of an insect. It was the ultimate monster that evolved from the interbreeding of demon species, insect kings and other monster species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Everything in Paradise saw this miracle and Yoo Joonghyuk was one of them. "…Chimera dragon."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the real monster of Paradise. The power was close to the 2nd grade but its potential was beyond the 1st grade. Despite starting from the bottom, it could threaten even a dragon, the strongest monster species. Yet the bleeding Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung were riding on its back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon exclaimed with joy. "Yoosung! Gilyoung!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The two children had done it after all.</p>
<div class="orv_image"><img src="../../../assets/images/168 - The two children had done it after all.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></div>
<p class="orv_line">*</p>
<div class="orv_notice"><p>* Official novel illustration (canonical)</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The chimera dragon roared and all the monsters in Paradise withdrew at once. There were those who escaped back underground, those who were frightened unconscious on the spot and those who escaped beyond the walls.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the midst of this mess, Reinheit staggered away from the Perpetual Motion and ran away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk didn't miss this opening. The Breaking the Sky Sword moved and Reinheit wasn't able to escape the sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh…Uhhh… kuheook…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Black blood poured from his mouth. No matter how powerful a demon he was, he couldn't survive his heart being pierced. Reinheit slowly collapsed and Yoo Joonghyuk and the party members approached him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dying master of Paradise said, "Ha, haha… all of that… in the end, it is nothing but a small play for those bigshots…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk stared down at the bleeding and muttering Reinheit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reinheit stared at the Perpetual Motion disappearing in the sky and his breathing became rough. "You might not believe it but I… I just wanted to create a good world."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some people who heard this yelled at him. They were all people who had been protected by Paradise. Some called him a hypocrite while other shouted that they should immediately kill Reinheit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that they knew the secret of Paradise, they no longer protected Reinheit. However, none of them moved. It was because Yoo Joonghyuk didn't allow it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tears flowed from Reinheit's eyes. "I, I really…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reinheit slowly closed his eyes at the short answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk spoke once again. "Everybody knows."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course they knew. Reinheit burst out laughing when he saw the life that he lived was so easily seen. "Strange. Why… do I feel like you actually understand…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk stared down at Reinheit. It wasn't in this round of regression but Yoo Joonghyuk had also sympathized with Reinheit's will. The memories of raising Paradise together and then destroying Paradise weer still clear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if to reciprocate the feelings, Reinheit spoke in a pained voice. "You… will go to the next floor?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The next floor. This was the location of the last scenario of Dark Castle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You… won't find what you are looking for. This castle, it is just the constellations' playground. So be careful. The next floor…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this moment, Reinheit's body exploded. Yoo Joonghyuk stared silently into the air where the dokkaebis were smiling.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Nah uh, that is prohibited.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Right, right. This isn't fun.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then the messages of the constellations came like they had been waiting.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations admire the performance of the incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations of the absolute good system agree with the judgment of 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations express regret over the collapse of Paradise.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations have sponsored 150,000 coins!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk's expression didn't change. The eyes of joy or sorrow weren't revealed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have defeated the Demon Marquis Reinheit!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[150,000 coins have been acquired.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The legendary-grade story 'Paradise of Despair' has been acquired.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your Dark Castle ranking has been adjusted!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new main scenario has appeared.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Main Scenario #10 ― '73rd Demon King' is temporarily opened.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Everything was so perfectly solved that he couldn't do better. It didn't follow his plan but he raised his Dark Castle ranking, collected coins and got a clue about the next scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless… Yoo Joonghyuk didn't know what these complicated emotions were. He looked down at his hands and started brooding.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Our saviour!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You are the saviour!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">He looked back at the shouts and saw people rushing towards him. They treated him as a Messiah as people knelt before him and cried. They were grateful to him for destroying Paradise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you! Thank you very much!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If it wasn't for you, we…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk heard these words and looked back down at his bloody hands. Then he realized the identity of these emotions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, he had no intention of saving these people. The people of Paradise weren't important to him at all. If Reinheit saw them as a sacrifice for Paradise, Yoo Joonghyuk considered them a sacrifice to clear the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk listened to the voices and thought about it. Since when did this happen? From the second regression? No, perhaps the precursor had already been there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His goal was to finish all the scenarios and save the world. Under this tremendous conviction, he kept running forward. On this lonely and slow run, he was worn down bit by bit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no meaning in saving the world if everyone was dead. Yet he stood by and watched people die. It was as if he took the sacrifices for granted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After seeing Reinheit's death, Yoo Joonghyuk started to rethink his goal for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Can I ask for your name?" Someone asked for his name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Being famous in the Star Stream was directly related to the strength of the story. By answering with his own name, he would be able to gain new achievements. Yoo Joonghyuk was well aware of this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk thought for a moment before slowly opening his mouth. "My name is Kim Dokja."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"My name is Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I was observing using 'third person's viewpoint', I heard Yoo Joonghyuk's words and felt a chill.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new achievement has been added to your fifth story.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The inhabitants of Paradise will remember the 'Liberator of Paradise Kim Dokja'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Lone Messiah' story has become even richer.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This situation didn't make sense. I panicked when I saw that the people of Paradise would remember the name 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, why was my name listed all of a sudden?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is shedding tears at this true companionship.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel, who had been quiet for a while, started jumping with excitement. I would've scolded her previously but after the banquet, harsh words couldn't emerge.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, that Yoo Joonghyuk bastard… he was really mysterious. That egoist couldn't hand his achievements to other people. Did he want to make friends with me now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't possible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That reminded me, all the party members except for myself and Han Sooyoung were gathered in one place. No, Gong Pilduwasn't present… damn, where did that guy go?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"By the way, why are you looking for Dokja ahjussi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The people who were excited about the chimera dragon tamed by Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung started talking about me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The faces of the party members changed after hearing Yoo Sangah's explanation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn't too surprised. Yoo Sangah must've stolen the prophecy from the Moerae. Perhaps like Dionysus, she was struggling to save me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi will die?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"By the person he loves most?"</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Incarnation Kim Dokja will be killed by the person he loves most. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The party members had extremely confused expressions. Jung Heewon looked puzzled, Shin Yoosung was concerned and Lee Hyunsung was struggling with something. Lee Jihye was the first one to open her mouth. "Ahjussi will just revive again after dying. Isn't it fine?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah replied to Lee Jihye's question. "It is a good thing but I don't know how many times he can resurrect…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It is a prophecy of Olympus and it isn't that easy to avoid."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon's words caused the party members to look serious again. They were this worried about me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked, "Then who is the person Dokja-ssi loves most? Don't we need to know this first?"</p>
