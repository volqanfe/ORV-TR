            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 59: Ep. 12 – First Person Protagonist's Point of View, V</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Writer. It was one of the few occupations in Ways of Survival that could give the Avatar ability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some of his strange miracles would be explained if he was a writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The lips of the 1st Apostle subtly twisted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Writer… do you mean the creator of the Book of Revelations? You have found out. That's right, I wrote the Book of Revelations."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't mean this but this bastard was suddenly talking nonsense. For me, it was a truth that wasn't possible. I looked towards Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint has been activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character Yoo Joonghyuk is currently using Lie Detection Lv. 6.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I knew it. He was a meticulous jerk. I asked once again, "You wrote the Book of Revelations?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. At the same time, I am also the sole owner of the Book of Revelations."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A confident laugh emerged. Really? Let's challenge it once.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used 'Lie Detection Lv. 6'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character Yoo Joonghyuk has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…What? This guy was telling the truth? I suddenly panicked and my circuits got tangled up. It wasn't possible no matter how I thought about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hid my confusion and asked again, "What exactly is the 'revelation' you are talking about?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why are you asking when you already know? A great epic about the future."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character Yoo Joonghyuk has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…Strange. There was some truth about it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Now it is your turn. How did you know about the plan of me and the apostles? Are you also an apostle?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You wrote the Book of Revelations yourself? Then shouldn't you know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It is fun to be an omniscient creator?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">He giggled like a leisurely villain while I regained my composure. No matter how I looked, he wasn't the author of Ways of Survival.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he was really the writer of Ways of Survival, there was no way he wouldn't know that he gave me a text version.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"By the way, it is interesting. I thought the woman in Seodaemun Prison would be the last apostle but a man like you was hiding…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Seodaemun prison?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hmm, you don't know yet? Let's trade. Reveal your true identity. Then I will give you some information."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's see? I don't think you have information that I want."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I might've been overpowered but this isn't my real body. You were a bit lucky…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know information about the future."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I deliberately interrupted him. Now was the time to sprinkle a bit of spice for Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"In addition, I know much more than you."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character Yoo Joonghyuk has confirmed that your words are true.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The expression of the 1st Apostle stiffened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're barking nonsense. I know more than you…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this moment, something flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute, perhaps?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment he realized something, I also noticed something. This guy, was it 'him'? Right now, there were five truths that I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One, he had read Ways of Survival. Two, his occupation was a 'writer'. Three, he wasn't the writer who wrote Ways of Survival. Four, he wrote a 'text' that told the future. Five, his knowledge was only 'somewhat' accurate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I read through 3,149 chapters of Ways of Survival.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As far as I knew, Ways of Survival wasn't popular and there was no illegal text version. But if he was the guy that I thought… it would be understandable if this guy had a 'text' version and knew a lot about Ways of Survival.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you like to live while copying others?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"W-What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">His eyes were shaken. There was no doubt. The 1st Apostle was him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn't think you would live like this. The revelation… Do you want to live like this? My teeth starts grinding together when I think about your claims of being the creator of the Book of Revelations."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What…?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It is somewhat strange. The information that you have used is meager."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy paled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Isn't it time to stop acting like this? Are you still doing it despite the world becoming like this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Joonghyuk!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy hurriedly looked at Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Joonghyuk! Work with me!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was silly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"As I said before, I know all of the revelations. Only I can take you to the end of this road in this world!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 2 has been activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Due to high fatigue, you are unable to activate Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 2.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Damn, right now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Think carefully! You can't break through the 46th scenario alone. You have to hold hands with me to defeat Anna Croft and the Zarathustra!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">This jerk was speaking the same words I did. Yoo Joonghyuk shook his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I have never heard of the revelations."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It is like a prophecy! Can't you see my attribute? It even says that I am the 'last'!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used Sage's Eye Lv. 8!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I also activated the skill.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The information of this person can't be read in 'Character List'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Damn, I couldn't see it. Yoo Joonghyuk verified something with Sage's Eye and looked at me. The severed head continued to speak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kill him! You should know that he is dangerous. He pretended to be you and will seriously damage you in the future. If you leave him alone, he will cause a serious butterfly effect and ruin all your plans!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was outraged. Did this jerk want to die together with me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Isn't it the same for you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I am different! Yoo Joonghyuk, hold hands with me. I will give you a vow or whatever you want! I will never betray you!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">He came out strongly. Yoo Joonghyuk watched the situation and opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I see. Joining hands…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Life started to creep into Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes as he looked at me. I couldn't see inside his mind so I was going crazy. Yoo Joonghyuk slowly moved his sword towards me. The 1st Apostle's momentum rose as he shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Go ahead and kill him! Kill him!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"One is a prophet and one is a revelator…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kill him!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Peok! Yoo Joonghyuk trampled on the head of the 1st Apostle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kuk… what?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you really know the future then let me ask you one thing."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blade moved to my neck. The 'One Sword' that I experienced through Yoo Joonghyuk was now heading towards me. I felt a sting and something warm flowed down my neck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey! What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The surprised Jung Heewon ran towards this side. I raised my hand and restrained the party. I was nervous but it wasn't good to stimulate Yoo Joonghyuk here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk asked the 1st Apostle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will ask you. Will I kill this guy now or not?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you have really received a revelation of the future, you will know my choice."</p>
<p class="orv_line">…This bastard had a bad habit. He was doing this again?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The face of the 1st Apostle looked agonized. Maybe I was the same on the 'Even Bridge'. Surprisingly, the answer came quickly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Of course you will kill him! You must do it!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a face full of strong convictions. His face was arrogantly assured that Yoo Joonghyuk would act like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Come on, kill him! And…!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sword moved. But what followed wasn't the sound of flesh being cut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kwajik!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The head of the 1st Apostle burst as it was stepped on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person wouldn't die because it was an avatar, but he would suffer considerable psychological damage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk's sword was soon removed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He was a mouthy bastard."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was a bit stunned. Yoo Joonghyuk chose to spare me? I felt a bit shaken. I wasn't sure…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me for a moment before walking away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey! Where are you going?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">This jerk, he must think he was so cool.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…Honestly, he was a bit cool.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Just wait! Are you going to leave with Lee Jihye?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Since the future has changed, the plan has also changed."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why don't you act together with me? I can help you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk turned towards me. I reflexively shrank back at his eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The debt is paid off. My last favour is not taking away your flag."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This bastard? But I couldn't retreat like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"In any case, you can't leave the station unless I remove you from the group. Do you want to receive the punishment?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk slowly moved his hand towards the hilt of his sword. I quickly added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know what your plan is. Aren't you going towards Jung-gu? It is your goal to complete the black flag by walking the King's Road. I will help you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I would rather take your flag right now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then try it. Is your sword faster or my tongue faster?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a gamble. Yoo Joonghyuk could stab my neck before the effect of the punishment appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You don't need to go towards Jung-gu. Go to the north. The territory of the Tyrant King will be yours and it will help you make your grand flag. Getting a flag and removing the enemy, isn't it killing two birds with one stone?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can do it myself."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There are 48 hours left until the end of the fourth scenario. Can you occupy 20 stations and complete the black flag in that time?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk's hands hesitated. He was caught.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Besides…don't you have a reason for going north? Surely you aren't going to throw away your family member at this time?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…You."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Remain calm. I am speaking in good faith. I really will help."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk's angry eyes stared at me for a moment. The atmosphere was strained. The killing intent soon disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There is no such thing as anything free in the world. What are your conditions?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, the regressor was quick to notice. I said with a smile, "It is simple. Let me know just one thing. My condition is that simple."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That guy you just stepped on, what is his attribute? One would be the 'last to get off'. What is the other one?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a while, Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">10 minutes afterwards, I called Jung Minseob and Lee Sungkook. It was a separate matter for the two of them. Before I could open my mouth, Jung Minseob asked me first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"In the end, what was that guy?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hesitated for a moment before asking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you know the novel 'SSSSS-grade Infinite Regressor'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah, I read it!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Sungkook raised his hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wasn't it the number one platinum novel on Textpia? It was really fun…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah, that's right. I had forgotten but now it rings a bell. How did it finish?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The two of them started speaking loudly as memories popped up. As expected, these guys must be interested in web novels if they read Ways of Survival.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There were all types of elements but… it was still fun."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, I read that novel. I was reading Ways of Survival and accidently clicked on it since it was on the 'Today's Best' list. Then I was surprised to see the development and setting of the novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–An infinite regressor psychopath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Sponsorship from transcendent beings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Streaming system.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–A survival game with absurd missions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, these were common settings. The problem was the details of the common settings and the way they were combined. I had left a comment as soon as I read it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Isn't this plagiarizing Ways of Survival?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered. Rather than a plagiarism controversy, I was criticized for comparing it to a bad novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I received terrible messages from the readers of SSSSS-grade Infinite Regressor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Isn't your business over there? Stop causing inconveniences ㅉ ㅉ</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was furious and even sent a note to the writer of Ways of Survival. Then the author said something. He was in a better mood because the number of views had increased. I teared up because I thought the author was pitiful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Sungkook asked, "But why are you talking about this novel?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The 1st Apostle is the author of SSSSS-grade Infinite Regressor."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh? It can't be."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That author would know Ways of Survival.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that the world had turned into the novel, a writer who plagiarized the novel could claim copyrights on this world. In addition, he added the absurd setting of the 'revelation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After some explanations, Jung Minseob understood and made an absurd expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was a plagiarized novel?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Come to think of it, the novel was similar… I can't remember well because it is old… why didn't that novel pop up first in my mind? It was much more famous."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it due to the attribute? Only the portion we read popped up. The 'SS' part is also confusing because there are too many novels with them."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is that so? In any case, the 1st Apostle is a plagiarist? Then he will have a text version…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe he has a copy of his own plagiarized work. He copied the plot of the original so he can see the future of this world to a certain extent."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was painful when thinking that a plagiarist was successful even in this changed world. It was time to implement justice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then isn't it impossible to win against him? If he copied the original to the end…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It isn't to the end. He only copied the early parts. He would stop early to prevent a plagiarism controversy later on. After a bit more time, the information he knows will decrease.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How do you know this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I just know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was natural. In the chapters in the 100s, I was the only reader of Ways of Survival.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Excuse me, how far did Representative-nim read in the original work…?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Before that, there is something you have to do. To be exact, it is something we have to do together."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Their shoulders stiffened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Didn't you tell me before? The prophets were hit by the Tyrant King."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah… maybe there are still a few people being used by him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Really? Then it is better."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The time remaining until the scenario ended was 48 hours. It was hard to do it alone if I wanted to hunt the Tyrant King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will disturb the information of these guys."</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the Tyrant King was using the prophets, I could take advantage of it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Reveal part of the revelations."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh? How…?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">They still didn't understand what I was talking about so I kindly explained.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"From now on, we will make a text of SSSSS-grade Infinite Regressor and spread it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">If there were several enemies, the answer was to make them fight against each other.</p>
