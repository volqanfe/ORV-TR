            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 414: Ep. 78 - Twist/轉, VI</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The great battle between the Apocalypse Dragon and the 'Indescribable Distance'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Stars continued to fall as two calamities collided, and this spectacle of the end times was being broadcast to all corners of &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The end of this island is approaching.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Mandala's Guardian', too, was watching it through a display panel. As the 'Isle of Reincarnators' began to disintegrate, little bits of 'noise' started to appear on his Incarnation Body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah still stuck inside the cistern spoke towards the Guardian.</p>
<p class="orv_line">– But, you knew this would happen, didn't you?</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What makes you say that?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Her soul wordlessly emitted a soft light. Currently, her new Incarnation Body hadn't woken up yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">– Because… the 'you' I read about in the 'Library' was…</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Please, you shouldn't discuss that story yet. There are those who eavesdrop on our conversation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment his words came to an end, the entirety of the temple was rocked by a vicious tremor. Ominous, turbid air was pressing down on the surroundings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Beastly growlings could be heard next; something emerging from the shadows cast by all four corners of the chamber wriggled noticeably.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah's soul trembled in worry after sensing that foreboding aura. As the bubbles inside the cistern increased in numbers, Sakyamuni finally stepped forward.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Oh, the Hounds of Tindalos, it seems that you've arrived for the wrong prey today.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He gently recited a Buddhist prayer, causing the shadows drifting around them to vanish in an instant – as if they were hounds searching for another prey to hunt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only after those shadows had completely disappeared did Yoo Sangah begin speaking again in some difficulty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">– What were those…?</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Oh, dear child. The door to the Final Scenario draws near.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sakyamuni's voice had become graver, weightier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ku-gugugu…</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Buddhist rosary around his neck emitting heat rose up in the air simultaneously. Already knowing what he was planning to do, Yoo Sangah asked him a new question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">– Am I not going to reincarnate?</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Why do you think so?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">– If this island is finished, then you'd also die. And I won't be able to reincarnate, then.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Dear child, we have already made a deal. A deal where you'll answer my favour, and this body will answer yours. And with that, establish this world's balance. Sakyamuni smiled benevolently and continued on. And that is why, my child, you will reincarnate as promised. Although you haven't inherited the Incarnation Body and therefore can't make your mark yet, remember that your role in the 'Final Scenario' will be critical. That is why…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She wanted to ask him what he meant by that. But before she could, her consciousness began dimming.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…For the time being, please, get some rest.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After her soul fell into a slumber, Sakyamuni extracted her Incarnation Body and started the procedure to transmit it to a certain place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The temple was rocked once more as the 'Kugugugu' noise reverberated throughout its interior. The display panel changed what it was showing as well. It was a scene of two men possessing the exact same countenance staring at each other, one wearing a black coat while the other, a white one.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Finally, you've also made your move, oh the one who stands at the end of the cycle.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sakyamuni stood still and watched this scene for a while, before raising his voice as if he was rueful about something.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[In that case, I should start making my preparations as well.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">But, how?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk hated that question. It was the most commonly asked question while living as a Regressor. He even knew all the potential changes in the repertoire, too – from "But, how did you know that?" to "But, how did you do that, you bastard??"</p>
<p class="orv_line">He got so sick and tired of that question, in fact, that there were times where he simply killed those who might throw that question in his way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now, he…</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…But, how?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">He ended up asking that very question himself. Even though he knew his opponent would mock him for it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsu-chuchuchuchu…</p>
<p class="orv_line">A face he knew intimately well looked back from within the storm of Probability's aftermaths. It was a face that couldn't be here, something that shouldn't even be here.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Chaos Points in the applicable region are rising up rapidly!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Problem has occurred in the scenario's balance!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk staggered unsteadily, but still, he did his absolute best to figure out the current situation. Like the passage of time, delayed by a broken clock, suddenly rushing forward again, countless hypotheses went on a rampage inside his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢He should've been Kim Dokja.⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢But, he isn't Kim Dokja.⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢1863.⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢But, how? How could something like this…⸥</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You should know very well that I hate that question.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_image"><img src="../../../assets/images/414 - You should know very well that I hate that question.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if his thoughts had been read, the person before his eyes replied to the earlier question. Yoo Joonghyuk took another look at the face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The white [Infinite Dimension Space Coat] glimmering within the bright explosions of sparks; the eyesockets where a pair of empty darkness should've been were now filled by irises of the exact same size as his. It wasn't just the eyes, though – the nose, lips, jawline, and even the build, too. A figure so exact that it was like he was looking in a mirror. The sole difference being a large scar running across one of this being's cheeks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk spoke, almost out of disbelief and anger.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You are not me."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Correct. I'm not you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The eyes containing pitch-black darkness now looked down on Kim Dokja hanging on his waist.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is looking at the Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The message landed like a final shot to confirm the kill and Yoo Joonghyuk shuddered involuntarily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The 'Secretive Plotter'…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">This being right before him was really none other than that 'Secretive Plotter'??</p>
<p class="orv_line">The one who sent Kim Dokja to the 1863rd regression turn, the one who told him Kim Dokja's secret and caused so much chaos, the one who sent all those countless 'indirect messages' until now…</p>
<p class="orv_line">That 'Secretive Plotter' was himself who went past the 1863rd turn??</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk bit his lower lip after hearing a distant explosion. He should think about this at another date.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let go of Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">His opponent was the 'Secretive Plotter', an Outer God born from the Chaos itself. Considering his unpredictable pattern up until now, it was eminently possible that appearance was a fake…</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[It's a miracle that you managed to survive this far with such a slow head.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Shut up, and let go of him. Or else…"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Or else what?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk felt his head become dizzy from the Status pouring out in front of his nose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He knew that his opponent was powerful. Even then, he didn't expect the gap in strength to be this great. The current him could evenly fight against Indra, an upper-level Narrative-grade Constellation, and not only that, he was able to inflict the god with grievous injuries, too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But, compared to the being right before his eyes…</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What exactly can you do to me?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Just what on earth was this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk breathed heavily while calming his legs shaking almost out of control. He noticed that the clones of the 'Indescribable Distance' surrounding him from all sides began to sneakily retreat ever since the Plotter's entrance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢Something like this cannot happen.⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">He got angry at the scenario's irrationality, and he grew furious at the &lt;Star Stream&gt; that permitted such a nonsensical Probability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And when his thoughts reached that far, the inside of his head finally cleared up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢If I think about everything the 'Secretive Plotter' has done so far, then him incarnating to this place right now should be impossible.⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Secretive Plotter' was different from someone like the Great Sage Heaven's Equal, Uriel, or even the Black Flame Dragon. No, he was an Outer God, and would need an incredible amount of Probability just to make his descent to this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsu-chuchuchut…!</p>
<p class="orv_line">For sure, the Plotter's entire body was getting swept up in the progressively-worsening storm of aftermaths with every passing second. No matter who you were, you could never be free from the Probability's aftermaths. Which meant that the odds of victory weren't zero.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢If I was Kim Dokja in this situation…⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he had become Kim Dokja, Yoo Joonghyuk began speaking in a calm tone of voice. "I don't understand this. You've been staying below the radar until now, so why did you suddenly intervene like this?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Because now is the right time.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"…Right time, is it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as that exchange came to an end, a bizarre roar resounded out from the other side of the empty void. It seemed that the battle between the Apocalypse Dragon and the 'Indescribable Distance' had reached its zenith.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The surrounding space distorted greatly after an incredible explosion swept by. Yoo Joonghyuk witnessed the view of the cosmos seemingly being crushed whole and it really dawned on him that the &lt;Star Stream&gt; was indeed marching towards its destruction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For sure, it'd not be strange for whatever crazy things to appear now with that type of Probability running amok. And the 'Secretive Plotter' had been waiting for this moment all along.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ku-gugugugu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The [Great Holes] were opening up far above his head. It'd be his first time seeing that many [Great Holes] appear at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was the hole of calamity that supposedly could destroy a world even if only one opened up. And through those vast, distant holes, innumerable tentacles began peeking themselves out.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Ohhhhh!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[■■■… ■■■■■■]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Oh, the great Plotter!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The rise of the vanished islands will now commence…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Horrifying cries could be heard coming from everywhere. Those true voices caused the bodies of the listeners to be stained by turbid energy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he was reacting to those true voices, the 'Secretive Plotter', still carrying Kim Dokja, began rising up slowly. More specifically, towards one of the [Great Holes].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk's expression stiffened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait! Stop!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though he had no concrete plan, he still stood in the path of the 'Secretive Plotter'. That's all he did, yet blood trickled down from his nostrils. His vision grew dimmer and the hand holding his sword trembled. Even then, he still spoke. "I can't allow you to leave."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Secretive Plotter' looked at Yoo Joonghyuk in such a condition and spoke.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Don't attempt anything foolish. Being able to regress does not guarantee you an intact life in the next turn.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk accurately figured out what those words implied. One life didn't end with that life; all the previous lives would always remain as a curse during the following turns.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He grasped his sword hard enough to break its grip and spoke. "I'm not planning to go to the next turn."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…Is that so?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Right afterwards, he felt pain akin to his entire body being crushed. This attack had no sound, no prior warning. Just the movement of the gaze, and Yoo Joonghyuk's entire body was being squeezed tightly as if he was thrown inside a compactor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He vomited out blood before roaring out. "Don't look down on me!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The pressure from the Status suppressing him faltered momentarily when the auras of the Giant Stories enveloped his body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since Kim Dokja was unconscious, Yoo Joonghyuk was now the holder of the greatest share of the 'Giant Stories' the &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt; possessed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He didn't miss this opening and swung his [Black Heavenly Demon Sword].</p>
<p class="orv_line">He poured all of his remaining magical energy into the weapon, and the waves of Breaking the Sky rode along on its blade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sword that could shatter the heavens and had already cut down a star. That very sword was now moving in order to cut down none other than himself. It was a surprise attack with no pretence or tricks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, his sword came to a dead stop after a loud, sharp metallic clang resounded out. Something made out of metal had blocked his attack. Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes grew larger.</p>
<div class="orv_image"><img src="../../../assets/images/414 - However, his sword came to a dead stop after a loud, sharp metallic clang resounded out.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was the [Splitting the Sky Sword].</p>
<p class="orv_line">The weapon that broke a long time ago in his 3rd turn life was being held by the 'Secretive Plotter'.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You can't win against me.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The two blades collided again, causing the vicious winds of flaming sparks to dance around. Blood poured out from Yoo Joonghyuk's nose and lips. It felt as if his soul was crashing down to the far side of the cosmos just from the clashing of their blades. Just one collision and his right arm were smashed to bits and his ribs shattered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk didn't display any hints of the horrifying pain and continued to raise his Status.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the bare minimum, he'd not die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Which meant that it was still doable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're also handicapped, just as me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, the Plotter's Status was becoming unstable as seconds ticked by. Sparks grew heavier and more vicious, while Stories maintaining the coat and his Incarnation Body had begun scattering away. It was as if Stories that couldn't be fused had been mixed together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢Without a doubt, the bastard is pushing himself. I need to buy more time.⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">On top of this, 'Secretive Plotter' seemed to be worried about something else for a little while, as well. He didn't show it in his expression, but Yoo Joonghyuk could sense it nevertheless.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, his Status was trying to avoid being noticed by something. Meaning, this bastard wasn't in a situation where he could appear here with complete disregard to everything.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Trying to buy time, huh… it's a plan that doesn't suit you. Did you learn it from Kim Dokja?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk didn't reply. The fact that his opponent had become chatty could only mean that the Plotter had become anxious as well.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You're only at the 3rd turn. So, your end goal shouldn't have anything to do with Kim Dokja. So, why are you so hung up on him?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"That's what I want to ask you."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[In order to reach my objective, I require Kim Dokja's presence.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Then, that's my answer, too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, a faint trace of emotions flickered within the Plotter's eyes. As if he knew what Yoo Joonghyuk was thinking of.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You won't succeed. Because even Kim Dokja wouldn't know what this regression turn's Final Scenario looks like.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"If it was only him, true."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[How amusing. The 3rd turn who doesn't even know anything…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I may only be the 3rd turn, but…" Stories flooded out from Yoo Joonghyuk's entire figure. "At the bare minimum, I've lived the 3rd turn that you don't know anything about."</p>
<p class="orv_line">New Stories he earned during this 3rd turn became a part of him and continued to circulate within him. Some texts flowed by in sadness, while some others moved about elegantly and beautifully. Stories that didn't exist in the past lives – and those that he might not get to earn again in the future lives.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Secretive Plotter' quietly watched those Stories, before opening his lips to speak.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[No, I do know of this life, oh the puppet of the Oldest Dream.]</p></div>
