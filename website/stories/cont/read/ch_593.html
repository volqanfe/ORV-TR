        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>593 Episode 8. Representative Kim Dokja (3)</h1></div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">At the sound of RepresentativeKimDokja's words, the chatter of readers calling each other's names and nicknames quickly died down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As a heavy silence settled over the room, I could see the reader's appearances clearly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They ranged in age from teenagers to people in their 60s.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some looked like friends and siblings, others wore aprons as if they were cooking. Some were dressed in neat suits, while others were in their pajamas, shyly hiding by a pillar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, this was a place where everyone would show themselves as they were 'just before they were transmigrated'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what kind of person the readers were, their demeanor was the same here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A deep silence, not even the sound of breathing could be heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Eventually, RepresentativeKimDokja spoke again.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【I'm sure you all have a lot of questions, but you are not saying anything.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Everyone who had survived so far were veterans.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Old-timers who had survived the hell of the first and second scenarios.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Certainly, the first person to step forward at times like this is bound to get their head cracked off. You all know the clichés very well.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if he understood, RepresentativeKimDokja's lips curled into a smile.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【But you can rest assured this time. I'm not here to harm you. The Banquet is short, so ask any questions you want.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The readers looked at each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if RepresentativeKimDokja said that, it wasn't easy to believe him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, he had the power to summon all the readers here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He could probably kill everyone here with a snap of his fingers.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 That is, of course, if my guy can handle the 'probability'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the original's beginning of the scenarios, it was impossible for a high-grade constellation to descend in their true form or summon such a large number of incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's why I was able to raise my hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsuchuchuchut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A spark has been flowing faintly through his body since earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no way that a man who was already overdoing it would carry out a showmanship of killing an incarnation like a dokkaebi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was a reader who raised his hand faster than I did.</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja pointed to him and said.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Oh, go ahead.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He looked to be in his mid-to-late teens, and he was quite a memorable reader, with his unique serious eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who are you, and where am I?"</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Curiosity about people and places. Good, that's how stories start. Who is the main character and where is this place?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Inhaling lightly, RepresentativeKimDokja looked back at the other readers and said.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【But who I am and where this place is doesn't matter, because I'm not the main character in this story. I'm just—】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Several readers gasped at the boy's question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's probably the biggest question on most people's minds here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this 'RepresentativeKimDokja' the 'Kim Dokja' we know?</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【You can think what you want about me. I may or may not be Kim Dokja. But more importantly —】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Come to think of it, I don't think you're Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy's voice was subtly hostile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja paused.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【What made you think that?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"There is no way Kim Dokja would bring us to a dangerous place."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy's voice was calm and rational.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Next to him stood a girl who seemed to be his family, but her eyes were unusually closed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It didn't seem to be because she had narrow eyes like Cheon Inho, but because of other circumstances.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After staring at the two, RepresentativeKimDokja smiled.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Are you two siblings?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"That's none of your business—"</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【That's sweet. The Kim Dokja you know would never summon your blind sister to this world. Did you come up with such a naive idea?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As the boy clenched his fists and frowned, the girl tightened her grip on his sleeve as if to restrain his movements.</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja laughed in satisfaction.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Kim Dokja is not a character who sympathizes with anyone for just that reason; if he were, he wouldn't have let the old woman die in the first scenario.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought the line was somehow familiar, and then I remembered that I had written a similar scene in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【He led people to stab each other to death at Geumho Station.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it was during the 'Duet Between Good and Evil'.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【In 'The Strongest Sacrifice' scenario, he sat on the sidelines and allowed tens of thousands of Seoul citizens to die.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Everything RepresentativeKimDokja said was true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the readers didn't seem to be shaken by his words.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Do you really believe that such a Kim Dokja wouldn't bring you in for his own purposes?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"He wouldn't."</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Why?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Because—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because I am a fragment of that 'Kim Dokja'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a girl across from him who cut the boy off.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A girl about Jiyoon's age.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know because I'm a fragment of Kim Dokja. Kim Dokja wouldn't do this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The conviction in her voice was so strong that even I was stunned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The girl really believed in Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe she wasn't the only one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you really 'RepresentativeKimDokja'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even an ahjussi who had been watching the conversation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I've messaged RepresentativeKimDokja before, but you don't sound like him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The others, who had been timidly backing away, also chimed in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you trying to say? We know what kind of person Kim Dokja is better than you do."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why are you dressed as Kim Dokja in the first place? Just reveal your identity."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As he listened in silence, RepresentativeKimDokja took a deep breath. When I swallowed my breath, it felt like all the oxygen around me suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned around, I saw that not only me, but also the others had turned pale.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【That bastard Kim Dokja.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I felt my breath return, RepresentativeKimDokja spoke.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Kim Dokja, Kim Dokja, Kim Dokja, you're really loud. Why the hell do you like him so much?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He sounded like he had a grudge against Kim Dokja.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【All he cares about is the life and death of &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt;. He's a heartless god who doesn't care how many extras die in his dreams.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like someone was poking me in the head with a needle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Part of me knew that. In a way, I knew it was possible to think like that.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【In your favorite story, was Kim Dokja really a good person?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A giant screen floated up behind RepresentativeKimDokja. The screen showed a scene from the scenario. Judging from the atmosphere, it wasn't the world line we were on a moment ago.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I wish to see the novel's epilogue." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a story in a novel that I once wrote and the readers once read.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the first scenario to the last. The long journey of the protagonist, Kim Dokja, and &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja's story, from Kim Dokja's point of view, for Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja said.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【You've all thought about it at least once: In that world, what kind of life will those who are not chosen by Kim Dokja live?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Beneath the feet of &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt;, who marched toward the end of the world, nameless corpses piled up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Their souls cried out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were in that world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were part of this story too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Kim Dokja didn't look back at them.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【I believe you know the truth about what it's like to be an extra in this world.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The readers were speechless for a moment. Even those who had been defending Kim Dokja were unable to say anything for once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the screen, a close-up of an incarnation dying alone in a scenario change. A lonely incarnation dying without the gaze of any stars.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He looked at me and said.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Save me......." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe someone between us is possessing that incarnation now. Now that death wasn't just an extra's story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was our story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you trying to say?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was I who spoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you asking us to relieve some dead extra's resentment? That's why you dragged us into this damn world?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja grinned from ear to ear, and then a message popped up in front of me. As if that was his answer.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&lt;Star Stream&gt; agrees to register you a new sub scenario.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new sub scenario has arrived!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sub Scenario(???) — Christian Qualifications&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Sub (Personal)</p>
<p>Difficulty: ???</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: You have been transmigrated into the world line through an 'Outer World Covenant'. Work with the other transmigrated people to prevent its predestined destruction and develop a new story.</p>
<p>Time Limit: —</p>
<p>Reward: Return to the original world line and additional rewards.</p>
<p>Failure: Death</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">To a certain extent, this was expected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We are from another world, just like Kim Dokja when he went to the 1,863rd turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was only natural that there would be a scenario to return to the original world line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was the content.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Prevent its predestined destruction and develop a new story. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Prevent the predestined destruction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, RepresentativeKimDokja summoned us because he wanted to change the ending of this world line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear the boy who had first spoken to him earlier muttering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"As expected, an 'Outer World Covenant'......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked around and saw that some of the readers had already calmed down and started calculating.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The hope that if they could somehow prevent the destruction of this world, they could return to the original world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As they gathered their thoughts, a few raised their hands and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait, you have to tell us where this world is. Is this Yoo Joonghyuk's '3rd turn'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt; also here somewhere?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Where is Kim Dokja now? Is he with us?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, everyone had a similar thought in their minds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The surest way to prevent the end of the world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Borrowing the power of those who had already 'stopped the destruction'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Why do you want to know that?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja didn't seem to like the question.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Are you really planning to rely on &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt; here as well? Really, you still haven't come to your senses.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The readers who had been asking questions shivered at the cold voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja sighed softly and shook his head.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Keep this in mind. You are the protagonists of this world, and this world exists only for you.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He swept his gaze across the room with a strange glint in his eye, then added with a slight smile.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Please, make a story worthy of being written on the 'Last Wall'. That way, this world will not be forgotten in vain.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Why is it? His last words sounded sincere.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【This is the end of this Banquet. See you next time.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja's figure disappeared into thin air, and pillars of light began to appear everywhere. One by one, the summoned people were returning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The surprised readers called out each other's names.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After regaining our senses, Kyung Sein and I looked at each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We hadn't found Dansoo ahjussi's daughter yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We hurriedly called out Jiyoon's name and searched through the rest of the crowd. Then, I bumped shoulders with someone. I turned around and saw the boy who confronted RepresentativeKimDokja earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy frowned and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hm? By any chance, you—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy, along with the girl next to him, was engulfed in a pillar of light and disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a matter of moments, the crowd had shrunk to less than half.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now there were no readers who looked Jiyoon's age.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pillar of light rushed right next to me and then Kyung Sein's figure disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Almost simultaneously, the feeling of Dansoo ahjussi on my back disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A deep sense of emptiness washed over me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't find anyone after all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that a familiar backside caught my eye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A small back, light brown bob hair that fell to her shoulders.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, my heart beat wildly.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The person who made me a writer was there. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The one who never gave up on me, even when everyone else in the editorial department did.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My editor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ji Eunyoo-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was alive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew she would be alive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Ji Eunyoo turned around, a pillar of light descended from thin air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyoo's surprised eyes looked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt my breath catch in my throat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no time. We couldn't even afford to ask each other who the other was possessing. All we could do was shout,</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Gwanghwamun!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">We could only agree on a meeting place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyoo was the last one, there was no one left in the theater.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was left alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Soon, I would be gone too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed lightly and waited for my turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One minute, two minutes.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">I kept waiting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Three minutes, four minutes.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something was wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much time passed, my body was not enveloped in a pillar of light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was going on?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I absentmindedly looked up at the ceiling, where the lights were flickering intermittently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked, but no one answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I called out a little louder, but still no answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hesitated for a moment, then made a decision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I decided to explore the area a bit more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, there's something that's been bothering me since earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I listened, I heard a faint sound. I didn't hear it wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is someone else in this theater besides me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound was coming from the entrance to the theater tucked away in one corner of the lobby.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In front of the theater's door was a sign that said 'playing'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder what's playing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A movie?</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I cautiously opened the theater door, a feeling of anticipation flashed through my mind.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Inho-ssi? Inho-ssi, wake up!" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The familiar voice triggered a series of memories. Slowly, a chill ran down my spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew this place.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Why is Inho-ssi the only one who didn't wake up?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The view of Chungmuro Station reflected on the vast screen, and there were my companions waking me up from my collapse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And then.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The backs of countless 'kkoma Kim Dokjas' watching the scene.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the same movie theater I had seen in my dream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The kkoma Kim Dokjas I met that day were not part of a dream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I took a stumbling step into the theater, a kkoma Kim Dokja looked back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The name tag pinned to his left chest shook.</p>
<p class="orv_line">rlaehrwk37.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as the kkoma Kim Dokja's eyes widened and he was about to say something to me, something grabbed me by the back of the head and yanked me hard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a cold grip that sent a chill down my spine.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【You shouldn't have seen that.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The voice was icy cold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned my head, RepresentativeKimDokja was looking at me.</p>
