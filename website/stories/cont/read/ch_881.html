<p class="orv_line">Secretive Plotter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had no intention of receiving his help until now. It was questionable whether he would respond in the first place, and I was afraid that my call would cause even greater chaos in the universe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, that was when I was in the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the 1,863rd world line, where there was already a 'contractor' who was clearly connected to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you in your right mind? Do you even know what you're talking about?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is an extremely corrupted god."</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Secretive Plotter' was the strongest deity I knew. One of the 'Great Old Beings', and the king of the Outer Gods called 'Great Plotter'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I could only receive his help, if I could somehow make a deal with him, then it would be possible to resolve this situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gugugugugugu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A loud noise rang out in the sky once again. The Outer God who was trying to interfere with the 1,863rd world line was moving. The scenario was nearing its end, and the 'Void Shroud' covering the Earth would have become extremely thin due to the possibility of my appearance. If things continued like this, it was only a matter of time before the 1,863rd round would collapse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, who was frowning, shook her head and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No. I can't call that guy. My contract with that guy is already over."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The contract is over?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Didn't you hear anything from the main body? The moment Yoo Joonghyuk of the 1,863rd round made that choice, my contract ended as well."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought deeply about the contents of the main story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I made a contract with 'Secretive Plotter' for the completion of 'a certain world'. If he gave me what I wanted, I agreed to help him complete the world he wanted." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the main story, Han Sooyoung of the 1,863rd round clearly said that. The 'world' she spoke of must have been this 1,863rd world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Separated from the 'main body', she wanted to have her own world, and Secretive Plotter provided this 1,863rd round's world as her stage, and in return, Han Sooyoung promised 'Yoo Joonghyuk's death'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Joonghyuk chose both regression and death."</p>
<p class="orv_line">And thanks to Kim Dokja's great performance, Yoo Joonghyuk of the 1,863rd round split into two, one choosing 'death' and the other choosing 'regression'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because Yoo Joonghyuk succeeded in 'death', the 'Otherworldly Covenant' that Han Sooyoung made was also completed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can't contact the Secretive Plotter anymore. I don't even know where he is or what he's doing."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Have you ever called him?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I've asked for help a few times. But that was already two years ago. Now, the line that could contact him has disappeared."</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart sank.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the sky, a tremendous Outer Deity comparable to a 'Great Old One' was about to come over, and Secretive Plotter couldn't be contacted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even if I could contact him, it's a problem. Have you forgotten that every 'Otherworldly Covenant' comes with a price?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can handle whatever the price is."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even if you can handle it, it's difficult for us. We don't know what the 'gods of the other world' want."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's words were understandable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was now facing the 'final scenario', and she had probably prepared all the plans through [Predictive Plagiarism].</p>
<p class="orv_line">But if a guy suddenly fell from the sky and called the 'gods of the other world', it was bound to be difficult.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But this side couldn't just give in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If I want to return to my original worldline, there's no other way than to get help from the 'gods of the other world'. If you delay any longer, your world will truly be destroyed."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, if I couldn’t return to my original worldline, this world was over.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Han Sooyoung seemed to have a different opinion than me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well. There’s an easier way than you going home."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn’t ask what it was. I knew it without asking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Seolhwa, whose face turned pale, grabbed Han Sooyoung’s shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sooyoung-ssi. No."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let go."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He’s innocent."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He’s already committed a serious crime by bringing that kind of thing into our world."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A cold murderous aura rose from Han Sooyoung’s body as she looked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"And this kid, no matter how I look at him, he looks a little dirty. He suddenly fell from the sky and threatened me with Kim Dokja, saying that he was in danger."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s also strange that he came from the 41st round. Why did he come from the 41st round and not the 3rd round? Did Kim Dokja split like slime and scatter all over the universe?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was diagnosing the situation so accurately that I was speechless for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung spoke in a cold voice as if to cut off the remaining chain of emotions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's better to just kill him here. That 'god of the other world' came after this guy anyway."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Just wait. If you kill me—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why, do you have any memories that shouldn't be lost? Don't worry."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung smiled brightly and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll retrieve your memories and return them to you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I never thought that Han Sooyoung of the 1,863rd round would be this fast.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She had activated [Predictive Plagiarism] and made her judgment. Eliminating me here was the safest way to protect the world she had protected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even if you have Kim Dokja's memories, you can't trade it for the destruction of this worldline?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Listening to her calm and composed voice, I felt like I understood her feelings a little.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I write, such moments come. No matter how much I cherish the character, there are times when I have to sacrifice them in order to protect the world’s probability—or to keep the entire story from being ruined.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Han Sooyoung decided to take responsibility for it by killing me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled as I watched the [Black Flame] burning in her right hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I respect your choice."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, thank you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung’s hand rose into the air like a guillotine blade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment her hand, which must have written and erased countless sentences, was about to strike my neck, I opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But do you know that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I certainly understood her as a writer. However, I was not a writer in this world right now, but a 'living figure'. So,</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The 'Oldest Dream' is not a 'giant baby'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I should struggle to survive as a character.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung paused and glared at me. Looking at her hand that had stopped exactly three feet in front of me, I calmly continued speaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You must have guessed it too. What kind of structure does this world have? How are the worldlines connected? Why do the stories always flow to 'empty places'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You seem to be trying to pique my interest by telling a plausible story—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right. So while I'm at it, let me say one more thing."</p>
<p class="orv_line">One day, the king said,</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Everything is already written, and it's being written at the same time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">If all of this is inevitable, and it's already written and being written at the same time—</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Han Sooyoung, do you think it's just a coincidence that I came to this world?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A puzzle was fitting together in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">1,863rd round, Han Sooyoung's future and how she saw the 'end of the world'. And even her clearing process that wasn't written in the main story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you kill me, you'll never see the end of this world."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I looked into Han Sooyoung's eyes, I was certain. Right now, she was thinking the same thing as me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How... do you know that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">If she has [Predictive Plagiarism], if she will use 'Ways of Survival' in the future, she must have already guessed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How this world is structured, and what is the 'wall' she will encounter at the end of this 1,863rd round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What she needs to overcome that 'wall'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"In order to see the end of the world, you need the 'Fragments of the Final Wall'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If it's a fragment, I have it too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But you couldn't get the 'Final Fragment'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's eyes widened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because that 'Fragment' doesn't exist in this worldline."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The last fragment of the Final Wall, only Kim Dokja has it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because this world exists to save Kim Dokja, who is the 'Oldest Dream'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's why Yoo Joonghyuk of the 'Ways of Survival' couldn't reach his own fire even after reaching ■■ of the world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can help you get over the 'Final Wall'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung’s lips parted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even without using [Lie Detection], the current Han Sooyoung would have known that what I was saying was true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A loud noise rose from the sky again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can’t call upon a deity of the other world."</p>
<p class="orv_line">My mouth watered without me knowing. Could it be that you’re planning to kill me even after saying this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thankfully, I didn’t feel the same murderous intent from Han Sooyoung as before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m saying that there’s no need to use such dangerous methods to send you back to your original worldline."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That means—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No matter how you go, you can just go to Seoul, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there’s no way for the current me to cross through worldlines without making the 'Otherworldly Covenant'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, if there was a way…</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is there still an 'ark' left in this worldline?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung pointed outside the window. Higher than where the seal of the Apocalypse Dragon was located. At the edge of that sky, the stern of a ship was visible, sticking out as if it was stuck in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That is..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's the ark that the guys who were trying to escape to another world were on. If we retrieve it and fix it, it should be usable."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Originally, I was just going to blow it up. That 'ark' was blocking the gateway to the final scenario."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, Han Sooyoung was going to retrieve that ark for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there was one problem that both Han Sooyoung and I knew about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kudduddud!</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard the sky splitting and the sound of the curtain tearing. The color of the sky seemed to change, and then the 'True Word Defense System' that was protecting the headquarters area began to collapse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, the Outer God beyond the curtain was coming to this worldline.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Han Sooyoung."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I called her urgently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't retrieve the ark right away. If I don’t stop that Outer God right now, this worldline will be over before I can do anything right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He’s the one who came after me, so I’ll buy some time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even if he catches me, I won’t die right away. If you retrieve the ark while I’m buying some time—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you talking nonsense?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I saw her expression, I realized something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This worldline was in its 1,863rd round. And Han Sooyoung was the 'constellation' facing the 'final scenario' of this world.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, 'Director of the False Ending', is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I realize her status, the power of the tales she had built up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Me and my colleagues didn't just go through the scenarios carelessly."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A dazzling light flowed out from Han Sooyoung's entire body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was originally meant to be used to blow up the ark, but there's nothing I can do about it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story she had endured and lived through was talking about it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The great story, 'Han Sooyoung Corporation', begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The story soared into the air, leaving behind a beautiful tail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, no matter what kind of history she had accumulated, the opponent was an Outer God that surpassed the 'old being'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if the myth-grade constellations joined forces, it was a difficult enemy to deal with.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what this worldline used, it was impossible to defeat that 'Outer God'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Great Nebula Destruction Weapon unleashed."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Great Nebula Destruction Weapon?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hurriedly looked up at the direction Han Sooyoung's story had been sucked into.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There was one. Just one. A being that can stand against that 'otherworldly deity'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But I thought that was impossible. No matter how strong Han Sooyoung was, there was no way she could control such a disaster.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 But Han Sooyoung did it. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Sealing Orb of the Apocalypse' that had absorbed Han Sooyoung's tale began to emit blue light. Watching that sight, I finally realized how Han Sooyoung had defeated those terrifying constellations and demon kings and reached the end of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Adjust the Apocalypse's sleep phase to REM-3."</p>
<p class="orv_line">She had succeeded in turning that 'Final Dragon of the Apocalypse' into a weapon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Apocalypse, whose eyes were still closed, raised its head toward the sky as if it was annoyed. And then in the next moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Get rid of it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Apocalypse's breath breathed ecstatic fire toward the atmosphere where the otherworldly deity was coming from.</p>
