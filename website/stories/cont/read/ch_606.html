            <div class="orv_title"><h1>606 Episode 11. Artwork (1)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">These days, whenever I pass out, I have a thought. Maybe I will meet Kim Dokja again this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was always thinking of questions to ask when meeting Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where are you now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did you call me here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What story are you reading right now?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Current state of consciousness is unstable.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Unfortunately, when I opened my eyes, it was not a snowy field.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see the dark scene of the theater around me. It was a theater where kkoma Kim Dokjas were gathered..</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I woke up, I thought of Jung Jaewoo. At the last moment, Jung Jaewoo disappeared as a “kkoma Kim Dokja.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe he's here too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People huddled around the theater and sat down. Small backs of heads were visible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it had been before, I would have thought of it as cute, but now a part of my heart felt cold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps, aren’t these “kkoma Kim Dokjas” all dead readers?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I slowly opened my mouth and tried to call Jung Jaewoo's name,</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Yoo Joonghyuk." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Voices came from the speakers in front.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were two people on the screen. One is Yoo Joonghyuk in a black coat, and the other…</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Who are you?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk asked, and someone answered.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "The one who came to finish your story." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like my heart was sinking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It cannot be done.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those two shouldn't fight now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I have to get out of here right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt my body slowly disintegrate. My consciousness will be awakened again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wow, the fight of the century!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the last moment, I heard the kkoma Kim Dokja beside me shouting like that.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">When I woke up, Killer King was kicking me with his foot.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're a weakling. To think you've lost your mind with just such a wound."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I groaned lightly and got up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a dark night. I could faintly feel the warmth of the bonfire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that I got help from the Killer King siblings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please eat."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King’s younger sister supported me and handed me a teacup. When I sniffed it, it turned out that it was someone who had put herbs in it and boiled it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by the color and scent, it seems that Elaine's “Dawn Dew” or “Baekoncho” was added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All of them were food ingredients that did not appear in the main story when reading.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's not poison, so there's no doubt about it. I won’t do that twice."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I just smelled it because I liked the smell of tea."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is a newly discovered medicine. It's good for restoring mana and mental strength."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King said that and drank it as if to demonstrate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a strange feeling when I saw a reader who naturally finds material that the author did not write.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it leaves the hand of the writer, the story continues.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Does Han Sooyoung know about this? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Along with a faint headache, the dream I had seen before flashed through my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I looked around in a hurry, Killer King said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jung Heewon is over here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Next to the bonfire, Jung Heewon was asleep under a light blanket. When I put my hand to the tip of her nose, I could feel her breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There doesn't seem to be any trauma, but I think it was a mental attack.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon still seems to have not recovered from the aftereffects of [Incite]. I briefly mentioned the situation instead of a detailed explanation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I met the Misreading Association."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, Killer King's attitude changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Tell me in detail."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I exhaled lightly and started talking about the gathering of readers under the theater dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Without even listening to a few words, Killer King quickly grasped the situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it. The scenario has changed. Are they considerate of latecomers?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Especially after hearing that a guy who called himself 'the writer' appeared, Killer King's eyes began to take on an eerie light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Author? You said he went with the Misreading Association guys?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know, but I wonder if Yoo Joonghyuk made that kind of expression when he was stabbed in the back by Anna Croft in the second round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Killer King quickly regained his composure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You don't know it, but [Lie Detection] can be cheated by adjusting to the speaker's beliefs, or the value of the information being said."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's something I knew, but I nodded my head once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"To say that he wrote the Book of Revelation himself… would mean that he wrote the 'illegal text' in the Revelation. In other words, it means that he is not a 'real writer.'"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was amazed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"By the way, if it's a illegal text writer… Is he the one after all?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you know who it is?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It must be one of the executives of the Misreading Association. I have fought him before. How did it go? Are you sure he has stopped breathing?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He's probably dead. He was seriously injured."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King nodded his head approvingly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I roughly understood the situation. You managed to survive."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"When did you two come here?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Half a day outside. Based on this stage, it was two days ago."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this stage had a different time scale than the outside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it's half a day outside, did it come around the time the 'Emergency Defense Battle' started?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"With the two of you, it wouldn’t have been a movie that would have taken two days."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We also met the Misreading Association."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The Misreading Association?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I belatedly realized my mistake.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did I think the Misreading Association would only be among the “latecomers”?</p>
<p class="orv_line">They must have read the exhibition through the illegal text, so the quick-witted ones among them must have infiltrated the theater dungeon beforehand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The number were five in total. As soon as I entered the stage, I met them. Two were rats, and three were snakes. I killed them all, but the problem was that the snakes bit me as they died."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Saying that, Killer King showed his arm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were traces of a snake's teeth on his pale arms, and a purple mark was engraved around the teeth marks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a curse."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What curse?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The Curse of Disorientation."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It reminded me of a setting I had memorized sometime.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A person with this curse is not only unable to judge the directions of north, south, east and west, but also unconsciously takes the path of the wind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Fortunately, it's a curse with a statute of limitations, so it seems to be lifted by simply escaping from this stage."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I see. So two days… um? Wait a minute."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's strange when you think about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King must have been the only one who was cursed?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don’t you have a younger sibling? Your younger sister should take the lead."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my words, Killer King's sister made a startled face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King looked at her blankly and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yerin is usually long."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King's younger sister slept on Killer King's side as hard as she could.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who frowned slightly, said with a sinister smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Anyway, I have a favor to ask of you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A favor?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Take us to the central research building. Then I'll spare your life."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King was once again kicked by his sister.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It was fortunate to meet the Killer King siblings on this stage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King is a bit strange, but he was a reliable ally on the same side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I think we'd better start right away."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So far, since the curse effect is also bothering me, I think it would be better to move quickly, even to arrive a minute earlier."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said while drawing a simple map on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know the location of the research building."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jung Heewon hasn't woken up yet."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely dangerous to carry Jung Heewon on his back. But there wasn't much time given.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"She'll wake up soon. I'm gone and I'll move."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't think there's any ulterior motive. Being tricked by you once is enough."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, the last place I met this brother and sister was inside the Dark Edge.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You gave us a 'Random Item Box' that had lost its effect at that time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I answered honestly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you use the box?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shook my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I thought he would use [Lie Detection], but I didn't hear the message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After thinking for a while, Killer King asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why did you leave the note?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the time, I jotted down some useful information in the box I gave them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it's Killer King, you've probably got quite a few hidden pieces that are good from that note by now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You really don't know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King glared at me for a moment, then turned his head away with a face that seemed to have hurt his pride.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No. I think I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed to be so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Killer King is curious, he is the type to find out on his own. Because he is such a person, he has read ORV 99.8 times. Ordinarily, I would have read a collection of ORV readings compiled by others.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"By the way, it's difficult to leave now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The roar of the earth dragons could be heard intermittently. Killer King continued,</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't know what you did, but the monsters are going crazy right now because of you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered the Misreading Association constellations that hindered me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Plague-Bringing Rat' exited after being hit by a probabilistic aftermath, but one more constellation remained.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Snake That Cut Off Its Tail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps he is the culprit behind this situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging from the fact that there is no particular setting that comes to mind, it must be a nameless constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that nameless constellation was a huge obstacle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There are two of them. I saw earlier that they are good at catching level 7 earth dragons."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was a surprise attack, so it was easy to catch. If we fight head-on, it will take us longer. And…"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[All paper rolls on the stage are affected by the 'Black Moon' effect.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King continued his words while glaring at the moon in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since that moon rose, the power of the Earth Dragons has been getting stronger.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If I meet the 7th grade dragon again now, even if I ambushed it, it won’t be easy."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Fortunately, that 'black moon' has a fixed duration."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Black Moon' effect lasts for a total of 8 hours.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was clear what Killer King meant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even when I thought with common sense, it's right to wait here. After Jung Heewon wakes up, it’ll be safe to move after the effect of the 'Black Moon' is over.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 That way, I won't lose anyone anymore. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I already lost Jung Jaewoo because of my misjudgment. If I make a mistake here, other readers… Killer King or Killer King's younger sister may die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I still have to go."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know it's not a realistic judgment. However, it is an impossible world to think realistically.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because where we are is fiction.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 You have to think of it as novelistic in fiction. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Guilt can't keep you from doing important things.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo is dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But he will be a little overseer and will be alive. Maybe other readers will too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They didn't die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And if he's not dead, there's a way to bring him back somehow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had to believe that now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was such a “story,” and I had to think of the next development in such a nonsensical world.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 To prevent the planned destruction and pioneer a new story. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Will I be able to reach the right ending?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Joonghyuk may die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King paused for a moment before asking again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it true?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King did not use [Lie Detection]. Instead he looked at his sister.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yerin."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sister quietly shrugged her shoulders, as if to do whatever he wanted. Killer King's troubles were not long.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm going to the research building."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">We made our way through the broad-leaved forest and headed straight to the central research building.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We often encountered an 8th grade earth dragon raptor, and even more rarely a 7th grade earth dragon, Tyranno.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It took some time, but we steadily moved forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The direction was not wrong. According to my thoughts, the research center was definitely over here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King followed me without a word. He sometimes pruned branches in advance to be considerate of his sister, or warned her to watch her feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be honest. It was a bit incomprehensible to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King heard only one word that Yoo Joonghyuk could die, and he was taking the risk with me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How could that be?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I have a question."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked Killer King, who broke off the protruding branches.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why is the name 'Seven Apostles'? At least in ORV, 'apostle' is not used in a very good sense."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the entire novel, the “apostles” did not read the revelation to the end, but it was a word precisely referring to their executives.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King glared at me for a moment as if asking me all that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I could hear a sound, and then the leaves swayed one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The rain that had stopped for a while started to fall again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Could it be because of the sound of rain?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We are."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't immediately understand what he said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I haven't read the story to the end yet."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Understanding came a little late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't even think of it. I thought it was the community name of readers who simply borrowed the name “Apostle,” but it wasn't.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The “7 Apostles” was a group of people who believed that the “Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint” was not over yet. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Since the novel was not over, they were defectors.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's why it's an apostle."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because they are involuntary defectors, they call themselves “apostles.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But the story…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It’s finished.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I was about to say that, something blocked my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were countless thoughts running through my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason I and the readers came to this world now. And an anecdote from Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint that is being serialized on my cell phone as it pleases.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, goosebumps went down my forearms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps, the reason why this world has no choice but to exist is…</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why are you asking that all of a sudden? Do you want to become an apostle too?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King was looking at me and asking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even if I wanted to become it, I couldn’t accept it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh… Why?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then Killer King frowned his thick eyebrows and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You act like a guy who knows the end all by himself."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Without realizing it, I burst out laughing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Killer King's expression was serious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You knew a hidden piece that I didn't know about."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If it's special like now, you’ll smile with a strange expression."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's just because I have narrow eyes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, ignoring my words, concluded his words by looking at my wounded shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"In addition to being used to pain. Do you have a [Fourth Wall]?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't know what to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, such a temptation arose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it would be okay to tell him that I am the writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But soon I got a thought.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 What's the use of saying that now? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I am calling myself a writer, I am not responsible for anything about this story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe my expression was strange, Killer King added with a light smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't take it seriously. It's just that I don't like you acting like Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The building of the central research building could be seen in the distance. We had finally come close to our destination.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I thought for a while that it would be nice."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King's expression, saying that, seemed somehow lonely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment about the other readers in the lobby of the theater. Maybe they're accepting the truth of the world by now, too.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There is no Kim Dokja in this world. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">They read Kim Dokja's story, and were curious about Kim Dokja's story, but they were summoned to this world without Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, for whom does this story exist?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Get ready soon."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The younger sister of Killer King and Killer King stopped walking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We all know that the real danger starts now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"As you may know, if it was as it should be, the ending conditions should have been met when we hunted the 7th-level Earth Dragon."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was as Killer King said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the main part of the book, the ending message appeared at the moment of hunting “Tyranno,” but now it wasn’t the case.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It must mean the ending of this movie is not like that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Coo coo coo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right in front of the road leading to the central research building, something was waiting.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The owner of the theater is looking forward to the ending you will make.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A cry rang low as if scratching the ground. The ground around us began to shake violently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The expression of Killer King and Killer King's younger sister hardened. Looking at the faces of the two people with a faint fear spreading, I felt an inexplicable sense of excitement.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this how I feel because I am a writer?</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is a guy stronger than 7th grade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or is it because I, too, am a first-time reader of this story?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Grade 6 Earth Dragon, 'Cretaceous owner', roars!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought maybe this theater might have the answer.</p>
