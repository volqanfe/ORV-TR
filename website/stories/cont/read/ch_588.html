        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>588 Episode 7. Trauma (1)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Will the 'Phantom Prison' work in people without any 'trauma'?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' wonders about your trauma.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Time passed and nothing appeared in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, I don't have any trauma after all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was born into a normal family, had a normal childhood, and grew up without any incidents.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although the long period of being an unknown writer was difficult, it was not traumatizing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I made enough money to put food on my plate by helping professors with their chores, and I didn't skip meals even if I had to eat triangular kimbap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you say it was hard, there is nothing in the world that is not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So if I don't see anything here, it won't be too strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that I heard a voice through the fog.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "There is no one without a trauma." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The fog parted to reveal a classroom scene.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fresh-faced freshmen sat in an oval formation. Some whose names I no longer remember, others I still keep in touch with.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among them was me, looking at the professor with a blank expression on my face.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Well, let's each share a story." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With that, the professor sat down and pointed to a student.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The student stood up and immediately began to share their trauma.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "When I was a kid, my homeroom teacher once told me that my diary was great and read it out loud in front of my friends." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">They sounded strangely proud.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I listened, it slowly dawned on me what kind of class this was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The creative writing program I attended had a famous freshman initiation ritual.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's where freshmen are brought together and forced to confess their traumas.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's a ridiculously violent event in retrospect, but at the time, there were those who believed that such nakedness was the way to true literature.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Clap clap clap clap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When one person finished, another began to speak.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "My trauma is......." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">All the misfortunes in the world were gathered there. You could call it a 'misfortune contest'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My parents' divorce, my grandmother with dementia's disappearance, my family going bankrupt and getting a foreclosure notice, going to the police station for stealing a motorcycle, having my house robbed while I was sleeping.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were all in their early twenties, so how did they have all those experiences?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a mystery to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was even more mysterious was the professor scribbling in his notebook as if he was grading their traumas.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, it was my turn.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I......." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought to myself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What's the biggest misfortune, the most traumatic event that happened to me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I was chased by a dog as a child?</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's too weak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I was put in supplementary classes because of my low math scores?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Laughed at.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't think of any plausible experiences. Compared to my more experienced peers, I had no story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, an idea popped into my head. Taking a deep breath, I spoke the first sentence as if opening a universe.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I stabbed my father to death." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Once I spoke the words, the story began to unfold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I talked about my mother, who loved books, and my father, who was violent whenever he drank.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I talked about my mother protecting me from my father, about the broken bottle rolling across the floor, about the feeling the first time I held it, about the hard shards of glass digging into my father's tender back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story was so vivid that I suddenly realized that maybe it had really happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe not here, but somewhere out there in the universe, a part of me had lived that life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was the one who started the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But when the story ended, I was part of it.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "That's it." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The room was now silent. The students stared at me blankly, without any comments, and the professor opened his mouth, having forgotten to grade me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It didn't occur to me until then that I had made a huge mistake, and in my panic, I unnecessarily blurted out.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Oh, it's a lie." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe that was my trauma.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 That I have no trauma. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After the fake trauma fiasco, my classmates made comments like this every time they read my novel.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "It's another one of those stories that doesn't make sense." 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "It's not sincere." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered what sincerity was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After some time writing a web novel, I still don't know what it is.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To put it bluntly, sincerity to me is something like the ghost I see in front of me now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smirked and approached the specter.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 8th grade ghost species, 'Specter' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I swung my thorn with all my might. My opponent was a spirit, so the hit damage was low, but the Specter's face was slightly distorted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dying Specter spoke to me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I don't feel you in your novels." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Why do people want to tell their stories so badly, when there's nothing interesting about them?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "A writer should have a personality of their own." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Puhwak, a hole appeared in the Specter's face. Through the gaping hole, a pitch black darkness stared back at me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "You don't have any." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I stared into the empty hole of the Specter.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' looks at you with pity.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There is no need for pity. There is no reason for pity.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier gives you a sad look.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For in a world where nothing has happened, there is neither sorrow nor joy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Puhwak!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Once again, the thorn struck the Specter, and it fell to the ground with a choked scream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grabbed the Specter by the nape of the neck and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't die yet. There's someone I need to meet."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then I got close to the hole in the Specter and called someone's name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know if this will work or not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But, if my guess is right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Who is it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">And after a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard someone's voice through the fog.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yoo Joonghyuk? Is that you?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a voice I'd never heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you......?</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it was definitely a voice I knew.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.4' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'I am Cheon Inho.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I let go of the Specter's neck and stood up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the hazy smoke, a blonde, foreigner girl, looked at me with her eyes wide open in disbelief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It's you, 'The One Who Deceived the Stars'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded and opened my mouth to speak to her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Nice to meet you, Anna Croft."</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>rlaehrwk61: Wow, so this is how they meet?</p>
<p>rlaehrwk99: Come to think of it, it makes sense.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk said.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "You must have met Anna Croft in the Chungmuro tunnel. You recalled the memories of the</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">last round......."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story gave me two hints.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One, there was a way to meet Anna Croft in the 'Chungmuro tunnel'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Second, I could get the 'memories' of the last turn from Anna Croft.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who has [Past Sight], is the only person who can find out the information of the last turn besides Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I'm under suspicion from Yoo Joonghyuk, there's nothing better than being able to hear the story of the previous turn from Anna Croft.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was for this moment that I faced the Specter without any magic resistance equipment or skills.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Kim Dokja did, I used the 'Phantom Prison' mechanism to call out Anna Croft.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—How did you know my name? You can't possibly know it now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Joonghyuk told me about you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You've already met him?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I met him by chance, though your reaction makes it seem like that's not how it was supposed to be."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft's eyes shook slightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—He really does whatever he wants.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at it, Anna Croft and Yoo Joonghyuk have a connection.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know how these two former enemies ended up working together, but now is the time to use what I've discovered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's Yoo Joonghyuk, as usual. But I can't wait to hear about it. What happened in the last turn? He said you'd be able to tell me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I was making it sound casual, but Anna Croft's eyes shone sharply.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Last turn? What did you hear from Yoo Joonghyuk? How much do you know?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Does it matter?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Answer.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Anna Croft' has used 'Lie Detection Lv.6'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This 'Lie Detection' thing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you forget that I can deceive 'Lie Detection'?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Lie Detection' has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Embarrassment flashed across Anna Croft's expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You, how.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's not go at each other uselessly and get this over with. It doesn't matter who I heard what from. If you keep dawdling I might change my mind. Right now I'm here to help you, but 10 seconds from now I might feel differently."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—......You're going to help us? Are you serious?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if I'd said something wrong, but after a moment of silence, Anna Croft spoke up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Just before the end of the previous turn, Yoo Joonghyuk said. When I see you in the 41st turn, he wanted me to show you your memories of the last turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—To be honest, I had no intention of listening to him because I don't trust you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The villain is going to reform, so please help me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Cheon Inho, do you even know what you did in the previous turn?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't know, I don't remember."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I don't know what Yoo Joonghyuk's thinking. You both are just as bad.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft sighed lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like the fog in the Phantom Prison was less thick than it had been earlier. There wasn't much time left.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm really going to ask you one last time. What happened in the previous turn? I need to know that much so I can help you or not."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft hesitated for a moment, then spoke up, seemingly decided.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Okay. If you want it so badly, I'll tell you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Be quick."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I hope you have a grain of conscience left, too. So I hope that when you see this story, you also feel a part of the hellish pain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Anna Croft closed one eye quietly I thought that this is not what the woman who enslaved Yoo Joonghyuk on the 2nd turn would say.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Anna Croft' has used 'Past Sight'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Past Sight. An unprecedented 'Prophet' OP skill that allows you to glimpse your own memories from the last world line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsuchuchuchut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a light spark, images and sensory information flowed into my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The acrid smoke made my eyes sting, and somewhere there was a thick odor of blood that made my head ache.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It didn't smell like the blood of one person or two; it smelled like the blood of at least a thousand people, all of whom had died, turning the area into a sea of blood.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Are you satisfied?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A man stood in the center of the bloodbath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A black coat and a sword stained with blood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His entire body was stained with blood and dirt, but it didn't dull the glow in his eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I gazed up at the polar night-like sky. I could hardly see stars in the sky. From somewhere, I heard what sounded like a dragon's cry.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "You don't know what you have done." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if counting the few stars left, the man said in a calm voice.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "You will never know what you have ruined, what doom you have brought." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Anger at its peak, reduced to ash.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The emptiness and heartbreak in his voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart sank just listening to it.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 As always, a man who has walked passed through everything on his own all his life. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, the clouds parted, and a faint starlight illuminated his face.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Yoo Joonghyuk, the Supreme King of the 40th turn, was there. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk dropped his gaze and looked at someone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man stood opposite him, unperturbed by the overwhelming momentum of the Supreme King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A blackish red coat fluttered in the ruins.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Black wings stretched out from the coat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, my heart throbbed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because I thought he might be Kim Dokja.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "That's a funny expression, Yoo Joonghyuk. I've already failed this turn, I should start over. Is that the face you make when you think about that?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But the voice wasn't Kim Dokja's.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "That would be convenient. You can always press the reset button and start everything from scratch." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The owner of the voice was laughing.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "But remember. No master craftsman can make two perfectly identical dolls. The moment you press the reset button, the world doesn't just disappear, it becomes eternal." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if mocking everything in the world, the man continued.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "This world will always be ruined, and I will forever remain in the deepest recesses of your memory as an immortal nightmare." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Though he wore a pure white half-mask, it was not difficult to recognize his face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was not hard to recognize his face, for it was the face I faced when I first stepped into this world.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Now, go ahead and reset everything. And struggle and die a slow death, flailing in eternal nightmares, you damn regressor." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And there was the 40th turn Cheon Inho.</p>
