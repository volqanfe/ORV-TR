<hr/>
<p>['Gong Pildu's stigma 'Armed Zone Lv.5' begins!]</p>
<p>A full level 5 Armed Zone.</p>
<p>With Gong Pildu's cool artillery barrage, all the ground rats in front of him were silenced.</p>
<p>Dududududu!</p>
<p>The ground rats stepped on the corpses of their comrades and continued to push forward.</p>
<p>"We're being pushed! Watch out!"</p>
<p>Less than ten minutes later, the front row of the fort collapsed. As the ground rats squeezed in through the gap, several panicked people screamed and broke ranks.</p>
<p>"No! Keep your place! Don't run!"</p>
<p>One man was bitten on the arm and dragged forward like a fish on a hook.</p>
<p>"Uaaaagh!"</p>
<p>He reached out belatedly, but was sucked into the mischief of ground rats. The screams didn't last long.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein's shoulders shook slightly as he¹ stood in the front row.</p>
<a href="#note1" epub:type="noteref">[NOTE 1]</a><p>"Inho-ssi."</p>
<p>She said, watching as someone else filled the dead man's place.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"To be honest, it didn't feel real until now."</p>
<p>There was blood spattered and screams everywhere.</p>
<p>People were still dying as we spoke. People who hadn't even been properly named.</p>
<p>"I couldn't believe it even when I saw people die after coming into the novel. In fact, I kept thinking maybe I was dreaming, and by the time I woke up, I would open my eyes again in my bed. That's what I thought."</p>
<p>Another person died, and another filled the void.</p>
<p>"But now I realize."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein said, shaking off a charging ground rat.</p>
<p>"I really don't want to die."</p>
<p>I thought I knew why he had suddenly changed his mind. Perhaps it was because things had changed.</p>
<p>"I want to survive...... I want to survive and I want to go back home."</p>
<p>It was because he had such hope that he could return to the original world.</p>
<p>「Prevent its predestined destruction and develop a new story.」</p>
<p>"I'm going to break all the scenarios somehow and go home."</p>
<p>He stabbed a ground rat to death with a thorn after it crossed the line of fire.</p>
<p>Killing, killing, killing again.</p>
<p>I don't know how many he's already killed in that short time.</p>
<p>Catching his breath, Kyung Sein said.</p>
<p>"As soon as I get back, I'm going to turn on my computer. I'm going to write on the bulletin board. I'm going to brag about it. In fact, I was transmigrated into Omniscient Reader."</p>
<p>"......That's what you're going to do as soon as you get back?"</p>
<p>"That's where I saw Jung Heewon, I saw Cheon Inho, I met Yoo Joonghyuk. No one will believe me, but one day I'll definitely tell them."</p>
<p>While he was still trying to figure out what to say, the man in front of him died. He didn't hesitate to fill the void.</p>
<p>"And I'll definitely read Omniscient Reader's extras too. The author-nim said he was going to publish a series."</p>
<p>I smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>I might be the first one to turn on the computer when I get back.</p>
<p>"We're being pushed again! Molotov cocktails ready!"</p>
<p>As the second column of the fort began to gradually push back, Ye Hyunwoo gave the first signal.</p>
<p>Several men in the rear fished out empty soju bottles from their pockets.</p>
<p>"Throw them!"</p>
<p>At Ye Hyunwoo's command, Molotov cocktails flew through the air. Gasoline sprayed from the broken soju bottles and set the center of the platform ablaze.</p>
<p>Kieeee!</p>
<p>As the panicked ground rats scrambled around, Gong Pildu's shells rained down on them.</p>
<p>He had prepared Molotov cocktails in such a short time. Indeed, the 7th Apostle wasn't a joke.</p>
<p>"Don't be pushed back! It will take a long time to rebuild the [Armed Zone]!"</p>
<p>The core of this siege is Gong Pildu's [Armed Zone].</p>
<p>If the line collapsed further, [Armed Zone] would have to be dismantled, but the current power was not enough to fill the firepower gap.</p>
<p>As the ground rats slowed their advance, albeit slightly, the man guarding the front fort looked back and shouted.</p>
<p>"More Molotov cocktails! We'll push the line and burn them all to a crisp!"</p>
<p>Something burst through the man's stomach.</p>
<p>It was the horn of an 8th grade underground species, a groll.</p>
<p>"Keok, Keoheook! Kuaaaak!"</p>
<p>"P-pull it out! Quickly!"</p>
<p>"Elder Pildu! Help!"</p>
<p>"Everyone out of the way!"</p>
<p>Dududududu!</p>
<p>The groll, who had the man on its head, was shot and began to fly.</p>
<p>From the 8th grade species onwards, they were hardly knocked down by Gong Pildu's bullets.</p>
<p>A monster that needed at least four or five shots to fall.</p>
<p>There wasn't just one such monster. They were popping up all over the platform, racing toward the fort like heavy tanks.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Gong Pildu's artillery stopped firing.</p>
<p>"Shit, I have to reload! Everyone, hold on for time!"</p>
<p>The line was about to collapse.</p>
<p>"Sein-ssi."</p>
<p>It was finally our turn to move forward.</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>As Kyung Sein, who had the OP skill [Average Correction] and went all in on physique, held his fire with a cheer, Dansoo ahjussi sent a flurry of cockroaches over the groll's eyes.</p>
<p>Kuooo?</p>
<p>Jung Heewon's sword sliced through its back.</p>
<p>The groll's head snapped off.</p>
<p>As three or four grolls fell in quick succession, the reloaded bullets of Gong Pildu swept across the platform.</p>
<p>Dududududu!</p>
<p>The monsters in front of them were swept away by the firepower of the [mini turrets]. The people cheered.</p>
<p>"Those guys are pretty good, huh?"</p>
<p>"Everyone, protect Pildu hyung-nim!"</p>
<p>"We can do it. Hold on!"</p>
<p>The crisis had been averted for now, but the situation was far from optimistic.</p>
<p>Only thirty minutes had passed. Gong Pildu's face was already exhausted. He was running out of energy.</p>
<p>In Omniscient Reader, Kim Dokja gave him a large amount of Intermediate Magic Power Recovery Potion to replenish his magic power, but now.......</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Defense Master' is making a worried face.]</p>
<p>A little more time passed, the number of ground rats getting back to their feet after being hit by shells begins to increase.</p>
<p>I wonder if I should open the 'dokkaebi bag' now.</p>
<p>"Kid."</p>
<p>Gong Pildu wiped the sweat from his forehead and called out to Ye Hyunwoo. Without a word, Ye Hyunwoo walked up behind Gong Pildu and stood with his hands clasped together, his small body enveloped in a brilliant blue light.</p>
<p>I immediately recognized the skill.</p>
<p>Instead of restricting one's movement, it speeds up the magic power recovery.</p>
<p>Immediately, I could feel the magic power boiling up from Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p>Uuuung.</p>
<p>At first glance, that's a lot of magic power, well over level 30.</p>
<p>That's a lot of magic power for just the third scenario.</p>
<p>It was clear that he had put aside all his strength, agility, and physique and went all in on magic power. It was a choice no one in their right mind would make.</p>
<p>"Here we go. Ahjussi."</p>
<p>The moment Ye Hyunwoo's small hand touched Gong Pildu's back, a faint string of magic formed between him and Gong Pildu.</p>
<p>It was the same way that Yoo Joonghyuk transferred his magic power to Kim Dokja when he fought the 'Disaster of Questions' Myung Ilsang in the original.</p>
<p>Soon, an abundance of magic power began to flow throughout Gong Pildu's Private Property.</p>
<p>The speed of the [mini turrets], which had been slowed down, returned.</p>
<p>Dududududu!</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo was now using himself as a 'magic power tank'.</p>
<p>"This is the fourth stage of the 'Armed Castellan at Home' Techtree."</p>
<p>After locking eyes with me, Ye Hyunwoo wiped the sweat from his brow and said in a confident voice.</p>
<p>"This is the 'Infinite Uroboros'."</p>
<p>A combination of high-level magic power, [Magic Power Recharge], [Magic Power Sharing], and [Armed Zone].</p>
<p>I was amazed at the precision of the mechanics, but I was also stunned that a human being could actually do this.</p>
<p>I'm sure Kim Dokja would have been just as surprised if he were here.</p>
<p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is amazed.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' is aghast!]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Dragon Lying Down' nods in agreement.]</p>
<p>Lee Jihye, who was watching us from the back stairwell, whistled.</p>
<p>"Wow, that's awesome? I wish I had one like that."</p>
<p>As the firing rate of the [mini turrets] increased, the battle gained momentum.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon and Kyung Sein were enough to fight the occasional grolls, leaving the remaining hands free to rebuild the collapsed fort.</p>
<p>The men working on the new molotov cocktails muttered.</p>
<p>"This is better than I thought?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, if it goes like this, it'll be a smooth-"</p>
<p>No, wait.</p>
<p>['Emergency Defense Battle' has entered a new phase.]</p>
<p>The message echoed in the air as if it had been waiting.</p>
<p>I wondered if the word 'smooth' should be filtered out from Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>[A new monster species has appeared in 'Emergency Defense Battle'!]</p>
<p>A message that never appeared in the original. In the first place, the Emergency Defense Battle is not a scenario that had different phases.</p>
<p>[A 7th grade monster species has appeared!]</p>
<p>A huge shadow flickered from the railroad tracks. The sound of a subway car scraping across the ground. I could feel the ground shaking under my feet.</p>
<p>"What, what, what is that!"</p>
<p>It wasn't the subway that had emerged from the tunnel. It was a large monster, at least 15 meters long.</p>
<p>'Giant Centipede'.</p>
<p>At the sight of the hundreds of legs beneath its five-colored carapace, the men lost their fighting spirit and rushed toward Gong Pildu.</p>
<p>"Uaaaak! Crazy!"</p>
<p>"H-how are I supposed to catch that thing—"</p>
<p>It can be caught. Yoo Joonghyuk would be able to.</p>
<p>The only problem is, he's not here.</p>
<p>I glanced over and saw that Ye Hyunwoo's expression was also stony. It was natural to panic.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi."</p>
<p>It must mean he was out of tricks.</p>
<p>I stepped forward.</p>
<p>"We'll take it from here."</p>
<p>"Do you have a plan?"</p>
<p>"We'll have to fight it head on and kill it, I guess."</p>
<p>"Like that? How?"</p>
<p>"I don't know...... By stabbing it?"</p>
<p>"I...... Inho-ssi. I don't know how many times you've read it, but that's not just a 7th grade monster species, it's a 'king'. It's a monster that even the 4th stage of my Invincible Castellan techtree can't handle. I'm telling you as someone who read it 50 times—"</p>
<p>I glanced to the side instead of answering. Jung Heewon, who had just decapitated a monster, was approaching.</p>
<p>"Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p>Wiping the blood from her ground rat knife, Jung Heewon nodded.</p>
<p>"Hide well, I can't protect you this time."</p>
<p>She tapped me on the shoulder and walked away.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo, who was looking at her blankly, smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>"Jung Heewon, I know, she's the best in Kimcom in terms of combat power, but even she can't do it now—"</p>
<p>"Well, I also have a techtree that I've prepared."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Actually, I didn't have anything.</p>
<p>But things don't always go well when you have something prepared.</p>
<p>It was the same when I was writing novels.</p>
<p>Sometimes the episodes I've written with ideas I had in the spur of the moment were way more interesting than the ones I've planned a hundred days in advance.</p>
<p>"Let's see."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon was such an 'idea' for me.</p>
<p>[All of the constellations in the channel agree to the use of 'Hour of Judgment'.]</p>
<p>An 'idea' that came to me when I had given up on everything.</p>
<p>[The character Jung Heewon has used 'Hour of Judgment'!]</p>
<p>Scattering dazzling brilliance, Jung Heewon rushed towards the centipede.</p>
<p>Looking at Jung Heewon like that, I thought to myself.</p>
<p>If this whole scenario were to end and I could return to reality.</p>
<p>「Maybe I would be writing about this moment.」</p>
<p>That's when my phone rang.</p>
<p>[A new chapter of 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been updated on the platform.]</p>
