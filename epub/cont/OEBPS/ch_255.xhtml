<hr/>
<p>The 'Recorders of Fear' are crashing into this world in the form of 'possession'?</p>
<p>"Are all the Recorders of Fears like that?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure either."</p>
<p>With that thought, several cases came to mind.</p>
<p>One was 'Bicheonhori' that I met at the 'Recycling Center', and the other was me and other readers.</p>
<p>If the characteristic of 'possession' itself is a characteristic of the Recorders of Fear...</p>
<p>"However, there is this saying. The 'Recorders of Fear' appear and disappear as if they are invading the world line."</p>
<p>They appear and disappear as if they are invading the world line.</p>
<p>I asked, repeating that expression to myself.</p>
<p>"What is their purpose?"</p>
<p>"Well. I guess it's to interpret 'Fear'?"</p>
<p>Fear. That word, which had been repeated before, now sounded unfamiliar.</p>
<p>"What on earth is this 'Fear' that they are talking about?"</p>
<p>"If it could be explained that simply, the name 'Recorder of Fear' wouldn't have existed in the first place."</p>
<p>"Can't you understand it even in a general way?"</p>
<p>"In a general way..."</p>
<p>The story expert began to calmly organize the place he had used. He swept away the story fragments that were scattered in a chaotic manner and neatly put the brushes he had used into his brush. The reason all of his actions seemed to have some meaning was probably because he was a story expert.</p>
<p>The story expert finally finished organizing and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"What do you think is the greatest story that makes up this world?"</p>
<p>I answered without thinking for long.</p>
<p>"I think it's a 'scenario'."</p>
<p>Everything in this world is made up of 'stories.' And the biggest flow that leads those stories was the 'scenario' hosted by the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p>Tsutsutsut.</p>
<p>I can tell just by looking at the fact that my existence is soon in danger.</p>
<p>This universe is a world where you are granted a 'qualification' just by participating in a scenario. Satisfied with my answer, the story expert nodded and smiled.</p>
<p>"Then where do you think that 'scenario' came from?"</p>
<p>"That's..."</p>
<p>Here, saying that it was actually written by a writer named Han Sooyoung wouldn't be of much help.</p>
<p>Also, even if the designer of the scenario was Han Sooyoung, that wasn't the logical probability that supported this world.</p>
<p>There must be scenarios in this world that Han Sooyoung didn't write.</p>
<p>In addition, Han Sooyoung didn't know all the content of the scenarios from birth.</p>
<p>She must have written the scenarios based on what she learned from other content and her own experiences.</p>
<p>When I thought about it that far, I felt strange. When I thought about it, all the 'great story scenarios' I knew were familiar.</p>
<p>Olympus' &lt;Gigantomachia&gt;.</p>
<p>Eden and the Demon World's &lt;The Great Battle of the Holy Demon&gt;.</p>
<p>The Emperor's &lt;Journey to the West&gt;.</p>
<p>They were all scenarios based on famous stories.</p>
<p>And that's not all? The general scenarios were the same. A battle royale survival game, or a variation of a mafia game.</p>
<p>In the end, scenarios are based on existing 'stories'.</p>
<p>"Aren't most scenarios based on old 'tales'?"</p>
<p>The Doctor nodded again, but didn't smile. It meant that my answer was incomplete.</p>
<p>"That's right. To be more precise."</p>
<p>The Doctor blinked for a moment as if choosing his words, then opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"All scenarios are 'interpreted tales'."</p>
<p>Interpreted tales.</p>
<p>A bright light flashed in my head.</p>
<p>"A very small interpretation of a tale can sometimes change the entire universe."</p>
<br/>
<p>The elf nodded again and smiled.</p>
<p>"I see you understand now."</p>
<p>"Are the Recorders of Fear the ones who interpret 'uninterpreted tales'?"</p>
<p>"That's what I think."</p>
<p>"Those tales are 'Fears."</p>
<p>Uninterpreted stories are difficult. They are unfamiliar, and sometimes even incomprehensible. The source of that incomprehensibility is fear.</p>
<p>"Even this &lt;Star Stream&gt; has not yet been able to interpret the tales, the Recorders of Fear love such stories."</p>
<p>'Secretive Plotter' suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Recorders of Fear admired him because he was the 'uninterpretable being' of all people in this world.</p>
<p>"I heard you are participating in the Fear Expedition this time."</p>
<p>"Yes, that is what happened."</p>
<p>The story expert looked at me with a slightly complicated expression and was about to open his mouth again when.</p>
<p>"The Lord of the House calls."</p>
<p>At the perfect timing, the guard opened the door and appeared. The guard's gaze was unusual, as if he had been eavesdropping on our conversation.</p>
<p>The story expert Lowellyn sighed lightly and looked at me, mouthing.</p>
<p>—I tried to keep you alive, so don't die.</p>
<p>I nodded my head in gratitude.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The conversation with the story expert was beneficial in its own way.</p>
<p>The most important thing was the information I gained about the 'Recorders of Fear.'</p>
<p>「Maybe me and other readers are also destined to eventually become 'Recorders of Fear'.」</p>
<p>I decided not to think too deeply about it. Because the information I could know right now was too limited. For now, it was important to deal with the immediate issues one by one.</p>
<p>Steadily, like writing one sentence and then writing the next.</p>
<p>If every moment of my life becomes a story, then eventually this moment will also be written as a story.</p>
<p>In order not to leave this moment as a vague 'Fear', I had to keep thinking and moving.</p>
<p>When Yoo Joonghyuk finished his breakfast, the escorting person came to see us again.</p>
<p>"The expedition team will be announced soon. I think the guests should come with us."</p>
<p>After discussing with the head of the household, we decided to participate in the 'Fear Expedition' as representatives of the Namgung Family.</p>
<p>[A new main scenario is about to begin!]</p>
<p>My heart raced at the thought of finally entering a new scenario. I don't know if it was because I was scared or nervous. I pretended to talk to Yoo Joonghyuk to hide my trembling.</p>
<p>"You suddenly had a trance ritual while listening to the words of the story expert. Did you gain some kind of enlightenment?"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk shook his head at my question.</p>
<p>"I thought you had transcended."</p>
<p>"If transcending could happen that easily, the martial arts world would already be full of transcendent beings."</p>
<p>"Well, I guess so."</p>
<p>"I have a habit of having a trance ritual whenever I feel like it. I can't miss even the smallest hint of enlightenment."</p>
<p>I realized once again how sincere Yoo Joonghyuk is. No matter how often he acts like a Transcendent, Yoo Joonghyuk is fundamentally a Transcendent who works hard.</p>
<p>He must have lived so diligently to become the ultimate Transcendent after going through 1,863 Regressions.</p>
<p>[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has increased.]</p>
<p>[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' shows you a little favor.]</p>
<p>I was startled by the message that suddenly came.</p>
<p>My understanding has suddenly increased?</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"It's nothing."</p>
<p>I had to bite my lips several times to hide my expression.</p>
<p>When I first met him, I thought he would never be my comrade.</p>
<p>That was understandable, because 'Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st Round' was considered one of the worst Yoo Joonghyuks among the many Yoo Joonghyuks.</p>
<p>And yet, I was able to gain a little favor from him. That alone felt like enough compensation for my 'martial arts journey'.</p>
<p>"Now that we've entered the Fear Realm, you won't throw me off a cliff, right?"</p>
<p>"What nonsense are you talking about?"</p>
<p>I just shrugged.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me with a strange expression and added.</p>
<p>"It seems like you've made some progress."</p>
<p>"Did you notice?"</p>
<p>As expected, the eyes of the Regressor cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>In fact, there was progress for me. Not something profound like enlightenment, but progress that was obvious enough to be seen right away.</p>
<p>[Congratulations! Your story has successfully evolved!]</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' has evolved into a Mythical-level story!]</p>
<p>Finally, 'Heir to the Eternal Name' has become a Mythical-level story.</p>
<p>I don't know why this story suddenly evolved. Maybe the story, worried that I would soon die, evolved on its own.</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' snorts.]</p>
<p>Or maybe it was helpful that I spent the whole night wondering about 'Kim Dokja' after talking to the story expert yesterday.</p>
<p>In any case, with this, I finally became the owner of a 'Mythical-level story'.</p>
<p>And the next moment, a bright light began to flow out from Kim Dokja's smartphone.</p>
<p>[The function of the Holy Relic has evolved!]</p>
<p>The function of the Holy Relic has evolved.</p>
<p>Maybe this is the first effect of the 'Mythical tale'.</p>
<p>As soon as I turned on my smartphone, the platform screen appeared first.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>…</p>
<p>Episode ■■. ■■ (■) +[??]</p>
<p>Episode ■■. ■■ (■) +[??]</p>
<p>Episode ■■. ■■ (■) +[??]</p>
<p>…</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Why can't I see the latest episode?</p>
<p>I pressed refresh several times, but the screen didn't change.</p>
<p>What happened to the serialization record? Or—</p>
<p>「Uninterpreted story.」</p>
<p>My head felt dizzy.</p>
<p>I'm now an exile, outside the scenario.</p>
<p>If that's why this moment was 'uninterpreted'. So what if these episodes aren't visible?</p>
<p>It was a plausible assumption, but it wasn't yet certain.</p>
<p>Above all, there was one thing left to check.</p>
<p>[You can check one comment for the desired chapter using the 'Daily Free Pass'.]</p>
<p>Fortunately, I could still check the comments. Does that mean the series was proceeding normally?</p>
<p>I'll know when I check the comments.</p>
<p>[Now, you can check the 'comments with many recommendations' first without using coins.]</p>
<p>[Would you like to use the 'Daily Free Pass'?]</p>
<p>An unexpected suggestion. It seemed that this was an effect added through 「Heir to the Eternal Name」.</p>
<p>Up until now, it was difficult to gather information efficiently because of the 'random comment confirmation system'.</p>
<p>That's understandable, because when you check comments randomly, it was difficult to avoid comments that randomly spammed Yoo Joonghyuk's name or the Demon King of Salvation's name.</p>
<p>However, if I could see only comments with many 'recommendations', it would be a different story. The fact that it was recommended by many readers means that there is a high probability that it has hit the core of that 'chapter'. Above all, it is highly likely that it will avoid meaningless comments. Of course, there was a function to check 'recommended comments' using additional coins in the past, but as the cost increases with each chapter (after chapter 200, it started to demand a whopping 10,000 coins per comment), recently I hardly ever checked the 'recommended comments'.</p>
<p>But they're releasing that feature for free. I couldn't miss this opportunity.</p>
<p>[One free daily ticket will be deducted.]</p>
<p>[Check the comment with the most 'recommendations'.]</p>
<p>I checked the comments right away.</p>
<p>Well, indeed.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>—Eung■i! Eung■i! Eung■i! Eung■i! Eung■i! Eung■i! Eung■i! Eung■i! Eung■i! Eung■i! Eung■i! Eung■i! Eung■i! Eung■i! Eung■i!</p>
<p>Recommended 195 / Not recommended 10</p>
</fieldset>
<p>I stared at the empty ■ part between 'Eung' and 'i' for a moment.</p>
<p>I thought that uninterpreted stories are scary, but uninterpreted comments might be scary too. That must be it?</p>
<p>Why on earth did this comment get the most upvotes?</p>
<p>I can't understand what Kim Dokja is thinking right now.</p>
<p>I checked the second comment.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>—</p>
<p>Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang■Pang…</p>
<p>Recommended 123 / Not recommended 6</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the third most upvoted comment was open to interpretation.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>—Jin■Isn't this dead?</p>
<p>Recommended 98 / Not recommended 3</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Sometimes, comments are scarier when interpreted.</p>
<p>「Isn't this really how I die?」</p>
<p>I blankly stared at the comment, then suddenly went back to the first comment and checked how many times '엉■이' was used.</p>
<p>It was 41 times in total.</p>
<p>At that moment, a series of keywords came together in my head.</p>
<p>엉■이, 41. 팡■. He's not really going to die like this?</p>
<p>Wait a minute, this can't be.</p>
<p>I reflexively looked around and muttered.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p>And then the real fear began.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk?"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk disappeared.</p>
