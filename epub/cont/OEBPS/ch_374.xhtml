<hr/>
<p>【Ughh…!】</p>
<p>【Ooooh…】</p>
<p>The most expensive [Fate] they'd undertaken in the past few months was to cause a rain of cow dung to fall upon the incarnation of the God of Wine and Ecstasy, who had betrayed Olympus.</p>
<p>—Call [Fate] to the Light Sword Emperor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a truly grand commission arrived. It was a request from the giant nebula Veda and Olympus.</p>
<p>—Tear him to pieces and kill him so he can never again interfere with the 'New Murim World'.</p>
<p>This commission was crucial.</p>
<p>The leader of the low-level recorder association, the 'Black Book Society', and the current orange-rank recorder, 'The One Who Draws the Question Mark', was planning to use this commission to 'promote his record'.</p>
<p>「If you reach the red rank, you can become an assistant secretary for a high-ranking recorder.」</p>
<p>Successful completion of the quest would allow him to work under the storied 'Fox Commanding the Sky' or the 'Demon King of the Cinema', adding footnotes to their records and becoming the 'Final Recorder'. It was definitely meant to be.</p>
<p>【Report. What on earth is going on?】</p>
<p>On the screen, the Emperor, freed from the bindings of the text, was dodging Agni's attacks.</p>
<p>The green mask, hastily rushing in, spoke.</p>
<p>【It seems an external recorder has interfered with [Fate].】</p>
<p>【I know. I mean, whoever it is.】</p>
<p>The [Fate] that had been declared had been erased, so it was natural for them to take a hit, but at the same time, ten recorders were put into a 'Recording Interruption' state.</p>
<p>【Is this the work of another syndicate?】</p>
<p>Even if they were low-ranking recorders, when ten recorders joined forces, the [Fate] became considerably more robust. This couldn't have happened unless some other record-keeping team had intervened.</p>
<p>【No. It was the work of a single recorder.】</p>
<p>【One recorder?】</p>
<p>The One Who Draws the Question Mark paused for a moment and asked.</p>
<p>【Has a high-ranking recorder appeared?】</p>
<p>But that couldn't have been the case. 'High-ranking recorders' had a pact not to interfere with the affairs of this 'New Murim District'.</p>
<p>【Unknown recorder. Doesn't seem to be high-ranking.】</p>
<p>【What's the modifier?】</p>
<p>【It's called the 'One Who Rewrites Eternity'.】</p>
<p>The One Who Rewrites Eternity.</p>
<p>It was a modifier he'd never heard of before.</p>
<p>That's when the screen in front of him began to flicker.</p>
<p>【Uh, a call from the giant nebula!】</p>
<p>The large screen flickered violently, and soon the face of a narrative-grade constellation appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>[What on earth are you doing?]</p>
<p>&lt;Veda&gt;'s Lokapala. It was the Flame of Purification, Agni.</p>
<p>[Why was Fate lifted?]</p>
<p>The recorders trembled, their lips trembling at the force transmitted through the screen. Even as a 'Recorder of Fear', it was still difficult for the lower-ranking recorders to handle the pressure radiating from a constellation of late-stage of narrative-grade.</p>
<p>Finally, the 'Question Marker' leaped from his seat and demonstrated his writing prowess, taking Agni's punishment for him.</p>
<p>【Please give us a moment. There's an obstacle.】</p>
<p>[Is it taking this long to kill an incarnation?]</p>
<p>He thought it was out of place for him to call out [Fate] just to kill a single incarnation, but the 'Question Marker' didn't show it.</p>
<p>[I'll take care of it right away.]</p>
<p>Perhaps even in &lt;Veda&gt;, they're overdoing it.</p>
<p>Even in a scenario in the 70s, it's quite improbable for a Lokapala-level constellation to 'descend' into a region with no connection.</p>
<p>[Remember. Your role is to properly record the stars' footprints. If I don't like the records, I can replace you at any time.]</p>
<p>Agni declared this and then unilaterally cut off communication.</p>
<p>【Those damned constellations...】</p>
<p>It was strange.</p>
<p>Even if they were arrogant constellations, they'd never been this rude to the Recorder Guild.</p>
<p>The green mask interjected, seemingly embarrassed.</p>
<p>【With all due respect, I hear Veda has been looking into other Recorder Guilds.】</p>
<p>【Another Guild? Where? Could it be the 'Backup Chronicle Guild'?】</p>
<p>【It seems to be the 'Afterglow Library' side.】</p>
<p>The Backup Chronicle Guild.</p>
<p>And the Afterglow Library.</p>
<p>All of these were the recorder groups that had declared [Fate] together during the previous 'Battle for the Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p>The 'One Drawing the Question Mark' spoke with a sob.</p>
<p>【We can't let those guys take our work away. Contact the obstructing recorder. There's no need for unnecessary sacrifices. Tell him you'll grant him his request if he just yields the Light Sword Emperor.】</p>
<p>He doesn't know who the recorder obstructing the revision is, but judging by the fact that he sent tens of their recorders away after several revisions, it's definitely a monster.</p>
<p>Then it's wise for them to avoid confrontation as much as possible.</p>
<p>【Well, there's no response at all.】</p>
<p>【No response? Why?】</p>
<p>【It seems he's signed a 'recording contract' with the Light Sword Emperor.】</p>
<p>【This damn thing.】</p>
<p>All recorders suffer a huge blow if the subject of their 'recording contract' dies. In other words, they can never yield.</p>
<p>But if they continue this deadlock, they'll eventually incur the wrath of the Great Nebulae.</p>
<p>Finally, the 'One Who Draws the Question Mark' made a decision.</p>
<p>【It's clear this guy is no ordinary recorder. However, unless you're a high-ranking recorder, abnormal revision abilities are limited to the 'contractor' of a 'recording contract'.】</p>
<p>All recorders naturally react more strongly to those with whom they have a 'recording contract'.</p>
<p>【Our goal is to eliminate the Light Sword Emperor, so there's no need to limit [Fate] to the Light Sword Emperor. Change the target of [Fate].】</p>
<p>Currently, the Lokapala of Veda has decided to use 'Half-Body Descent'.</p>
<p>【For the next five minutes, we will support Agni's 'Full Descent'.】</p>
<p>In that case, it would be a more strategic choice to use [Fate] on Lokapala to increase the likelihood.</p>
<p>Even if a high-ranking recorder intervenes, this [Fate] will be unstoppable.</p>
<p>【Let's erase the name of that recorder forever, along with the Light Sword Emperor.】</p>
<hr/>
<p>「"Dokja-ssi."」</p>
<p>Jung Heewon bit her lip and stared into space.</p>
<p>It had already been five minutes since she had escaped the one-sided bombardment. Now, just standing still in Jung Heewon's incarnation body was a miracle.</p>
<p>「[You truly amaze me, young incarnation.]」</p>
<p>Agni was strong. A head-on collision would crush every bone in her body with a single blow.</p>
<p>「Still, Jung Heewon continued to move.」</p>
<p>Brightly glowing sentences supported her movements.</p>
<p>「The [Vermilion Phoenix], practiced tens of thousands of times, miraculously evaded Agni's attack.」</p>
<p>「The sword, never let go of her hand, deflected Agni's trajectory, imbued with a fatal force.」</p>
<p>Of course, I don't know how Jung Heewon lived.</p>
<p>But even without understanding her timeline, I can easily imagine. It was a fantasy possible only because I trusted her.</p>
<p>It was a sentence I could willingly write, believing that for the past eight years, she had undergone more rigorous training than I could ever imagine.</p>
<p>「The trajectory of the Heavenly Blade moved in her hand.」</p>
<p>Transcendental Stage 4.</p>
<p>The ultimate state, where, once fully mastered, one could stand a chance against even the most skilled constellations.</p>
<p>Kugugugugu.</p>
<p>The [Heavenly Blade Sword], barely activated, once again deflected Agni's fist. But now, it was her limit.</p>
<p>【If she pushes yourself any further, her sword will break.】</p>
<p>Bicheonhori, who had been watching the entire battle with amusement, intervened.</p>
<p>I knew it. Jung Heewon couldn't fight anymore.</p>
<p>【Heewon-ssi.】</p>
<p>And my strategy was just beginning.</p>
<p>「'Are you sure?'」</p>
<p>Jung Heewon glanced up at the sky, as if to confirm my sincerity, then sighed lightly and her expression hardened. Then, with a strange smile on her face, she opened her mouth to Agni.</p>
<p>「"Veda says there are only eight 'Locapalas', but how disappointing. Is this all there is? If it were the 'God of Supreme Light', he would have burned me to death long ago."」</p>
<p>It was a provocation the usual Jung Heewon would never have made. And it was also a provocation the usual Agni wouldn't have succumbed to.</p>
<p>「[You're talking funnily.]」</p>
<p>But the current situation was a bit special. This fight was being watched by another Locapala of Veda.</p>
<p>[The 'God of Supreme Light' makes an intrigued expression.]</p>
<p>And then there were one of the twelve constellations of &lt;Olympus&gt; and a constellation of the narrative-grade from &lt;Tamra&gt;.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'God of Wine and Ecstasy', bursts into mirthful laughter.]</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Monarch of the Small Fries', chuckles.]</p>
<p>Of course, if that were all, Agni wouldn't have been sincere.</p>
<p>[Many 'Recorders of Fear' are in the process of recording.]</p>
<p>This fight was being 'recorded' by the recorders.</p>
<p>In other words, no matter how this fight ended, it would inevitably remain a 'story'.</p>
<p>「[If you truly desire my wrath...]」</p>
<p>Agni's expression contorted like a vicious evil spirit.</p>
<p>「[It is the duty of 'Locapala' to lead you to 'liberation'.]」</p>
<p>His entire body, which had once stood over ten meters in a half-ascension state, began to grow again.</p>
<p>Twenty meters, thirty meters, forty meters... a hundred meters. He had already towered higher than most buildings.</p>
<p>「[Incarnations who worship Vedas, listen up.]」</p>
<p>The incarnations who had been hiding nearby, watching the battle, looked up at the sky, bleeding from their orifices, at the resonating sound of the mantra.</p>
<p>「[Those who do not wish to be liberated, flee this area immediately.]」</p>
<p>The terrified incarnations screamed and began to flee. Both ascended and non-ascended alike fled in a panic.</p>
<p>Only Jung Heewon remained unmoved, witnessing the descent of the great god.</p>
<p>「The heavens open, and a black beast, uttering a terrible howl, descends.」</p>
<p>A gigantic black goat raced through the sky and descended to earth.</p>
<p>「A divine being, wielding an axe, sat down on the ornately decorated black goat.」</p>
<p>Who could dare confront that being?</p>
<p>「He has three faces and many arms, yet he wears a crown of blazing flames.」</p>
<p>Just meeting his gaze felt like my entire body was on fire.</p>
<p>「He is the god of fire, Agni, the flame that purifies the universe.」</p>
<p>That was the true form of Agni, the god of fire, standing shoulder to shoulder with the 'God of Supreme Light'.</p>
<p>The moment I saw him, I was certain.</p>
<p>This wasn't a battlefield as plausible as the 'Great Battle of Good and Evil'.</p>
<p>For a power so close to its true form to be revealed in such a place meant someone else was helping.</p>
<p>[Many Recorders of Fear contribute to the depiction of the 'Flame of Purification'.]</p>
<p>Probably the work of the Recorders.</p>
<p>「"Dokja-ssi. That..."」</p>
<p>In scenario 70, a one-on-one confrontation with 'Locapala', who was close to complete descent. It was a truly desperate situation, but I didn't panic.</p>
<p>【Yes.】</p>
<p>Probably the same for Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>【I guess we've passed the point where we can call him a 'human'.】</p>
<p>Agni's transformed incarnation now looked less human and more like some other species.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon nodded and said,</p>
<p>「"I suppose it's more correct to think of it as a monster."」</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, 'Time of Judgment', activates!]</p>
<p>The characteristics of the Judgement trait.</p>
<p>'Judge of Demon Destruction', which activates against monsters, began to shine.</p>
