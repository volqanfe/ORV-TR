<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">874 Episode 47 King of Fear (18)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>Recorder of Fear.</p>
<p>I couldn't quite understand why I was given that role now.</p>
<p>[A huge amount of 'loss' has been collected.]</p>
<p>[The 'loss' you collected will be recorded on the Final Wall.]</p>
<p>As far as I know, I have not yet met the prerequisites to become a 'Recorder of Fear.'</p>
<p>According to the information I heard from Bicheonhori, there are two major conditions to become a 'Recorder of Fear'.</p>
<p>One, you must have reached the 'end' of the world, but were not satisfied with the ending.</p>
<p>Second, you must have the 'possibility of recording' that the Oldest Dream can hope for.</p>
<p>The latter condition was difficult to define, but the former condition was clear.</p>
<p>Both Asmodeus and Bicheonhori survived until the end of their respective world lines, but were not satisfied with the ending, so they became 'Recorders of Fear'.</p>
<p>However, I had not even seen the 'end of the world'. Of course, I did get a glimpse of the ending of the 40th Round through the 'Time Fault', but that was only a glimpse through the 'Time Fault'.</p>
<p>"How did I become a Recorder of Fear?"</p>
<p>Then the Demon King of Salvation answered as if asking why.</p>
<p>—You saw the end of the world.</p>
<p>"The end of the world? Are you talking about what I experienced in the 'Time Fault'?"</p>
<p>—What are you talking about? Hey, here it comes.</p>
<p>I quickly tilted my head back to avoid the shockwave mass flying towards me.</p>
<p>The shockwave mass that passed by my cheek as if it was scratching me crashed into the 'Time Fault Room' and turned the area into dust.</p>
<p>—You're Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>It was dizzying. But strangely, I didn't feel nervous.</p>
<p>As if I had already experienced all of this once, an unprecedented sense of composure settled deep in my heart.</p>
<p>—We already saw the 'End of the World' once in the 1,864th round.</p>
<p>The moment I heard that, something suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p>I looked through the message log and reconfirmed the message I had just seen.</p>
<p>[The effect of the trait, 'Record Repairer', is activated!]</p>
<p>[Record repair is complete!]</p>
<p>The effect of the trait 'Record Repairer' is to restore the 'story' that was lost through the 'Kim Dokja Fragment' that I obtained.</p>
<p>This time, because of the repair, I regained my skill [□□] and became a 'Recorder of Fear'.</p>
<p>"We already had the qualifications of a 'Recorder of Fear'."</p>
<p>—Yes.</p>
<p>"Did Kim Dokja have a story he wanted to change?"</p>
<p>—Maybe.</p>
<p>Even though Kim Dokja saw the end of the world, he still had a 'story he wanted to change'. Neither I, the Demon King of Salvation, nor perhaps the King of Fear know what it was.</p>
<p>Because only Kim Dokja, who was the 'One and Only Kim Dokja', knows.</p>
<p>What he wanted to change could have been the 999th Round, or the 1,864th Round. If not that—</p>
<p>「It could have been right now.」</p>
<p>The shockwave that flew in this time was a large lump. It was an electric shock that I couldn't avoid no matter how fast I moved.</p>
<p>So I didn't dodge. Instead, I opened the [Bookmark] and inserted 'Kyrgios Rodgraim', which I had sufficiently gained understanding of, into the bookmark.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, Electrification Lv.???', is activated!]</p>
<p>Kyrgios' exclusive technique, the perfect humanization that reached the realm of the realm, dyed my entire body in the aura of the Baekcheong.</p>
<p>I swung my 'Unbreakable Faith' with all my might toward the lightning wave that was flying towards me.</p>
<p>Tsutsutsutsut!</p>
<p>My fingertips burned brightly as if they had been electrocuted. Sparks began to flow through my entire body along with terrible pain.</p>
<p>It was the price I paid for using power that I couldn't handle at the moment.</p>
<p>—There are several advantages to becoming a Recorder of Fear. One of them is that your tolerance for 'probability' increases.</p>
<p>In fact, Asmodeus, the 'Recorder of Fear', did some ridiculous things, such as interfering with the early scenario, but he was not destroyed by the aftermath of probability.</p>
<p>—In your case, your tolerance would increase even more.</p>
<p>[The story, 'One Who Rewrites Fate', begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>In addition to the effects of 'Recorder of Fear', the unique effects of the story 'One Who Rewrites Fate' were also added.</p>
<p>As the effects of resisting the aftermath of probability created synergy, the sparks that had been strongly pressing on my entire body began to gradually decrease.</p>
<p>Even though I had called upon the power of 'Kyrgios', I was free from the probability of the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p>"This is not enough."</p>
<p>But it was still not enough to close the door of the Time Fault.</p>
<p>Even so, the Demon King of Salvation was calm.</p>
<p>—It's okay. We've already dealt with the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>"We did."</p>
<p>—The same goes for the Second.</p>
<p>As I slowly blinked, Second child Kim Dokja's story began to be heard through the [Fourth Wall].</p>
<p>He was the 'Watcher of Light and Darkness'.</p>
<p>The experience of the 'Great Battle of the Holy Demons' that he had preserved was being released through me. The story of the Archangels and Demon Kings fighting, and &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; being active.</p>
<p>[The Giant tale, 'Season of Light and Darkness', tells you.]</p>
<p>The temporarily activated Giant tale took hold of my body.</p>
<p>I started to dash through the lightning waves as if I had a booster.</p>
<p>Tsutsutsut!</p>
<p>I can do it. If I were me now, I could close that 'door'.</p>
<p>—Youngest, left!</p>
<p>I dodged, offset, and pushed back the lightning waves that flew in sporadically, and I slowly advanced toward the door where the final tail was shaking.</p>
<p>[No!]</p>
<p>Jang Hayoung shouted, realizing what I was trying to do.</p>
<p>【The first phase will end soon! The second phase will begin!】</p>
<p>The final dragon's shockwave consists of three phases. If the first phase was 'Lightning', the theme of the second phase was 'Flame'.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, I didn't have a bookmark for a character who could handle 'flames' well.</p>
<p>In other words, the only time I could close that 'door' was while the 'first phase' was still going on.</p>
<p>There was absolutely no time left, and there was no quick solution.</p>
<p>But it was okay.</p>
<p>[You want to do something unexpected.]</p>
<p>[Describe your own actions.]</p>
<p>[Use 5 probability points.]</p>
<p>If there is no method, just write down a method.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, '□□', is activated.]</p>
<p>The surrounding scenery began to turn colorless.</p>
<p>[□□, a skill that activates when someone is about to do something unexpected.]</p>
<p>I saved my life several times with this skill at the beginning of the scenarios.</p>
<p>[Warning! The activity of '□□' is not smooth in the area!]</p>
<p>[You have entered the 'Snowfield'.]</p>
<p>[The time to enter the 'Snowfield' is reduced.]</p>
<p>[Describe your next action.]</p>
<fieldset>
<p># Apocalypse Dragon's Paragraph</p>
<p>「At that moment, ■■■ is □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□…」</p>
<p>* Based on the current proficiency, a total of ??? additional descriptions are possible.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Is it because I activated the skill after a long time?</p>
<p>Many things were different than before.</p>
<p>My name disappeared, and the total amount of additional descriptions was not written down.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, time was also an issue.</p>
<p>[You can stay in the Snowfield for a total of 20 seconds.]</p>
<p>Only 20 seconds.</p>
<p>I guess the opponent is too strong, so the time you can drag them out is not long.</p>
<p>It was only 20 seconds, but I wasn't particularly nervous or disappointed. Because I could have written a story in those 20 seconds.</p>
<p>I paused for a moment when I was writing my name filled with '■■■'.</p>
<p>Once I started writing the sentence, I picked up speed, and unnecessary sentences and absolutely necessary sentences were quickly sorted out in my head.</p>
<p>[You are currently unable to use the probability you have accumulated.]</p>
<p>Normally, I would have used the accumulated probability to increase the scene reproduction rate, but it was impossible at the moment.</p>
<p>[You lack the probability allowed.]</p>
<p>So I described the sentence without 'additional probability'.</p>
<p>[You lack the probability allowed.]</p>
<p>I checked all the materials and situations, items I could use. Whether it was Constellations, incarnations, or anything else.</p>
<p>[You lack the probability allowed.]</p>
<p>And this was the result.</p>
<p>[You described strange and wonderful content.]</p>
<p>[The reproduction success rate of this description is 50%.]</p>
<p>[Would you like to check the reader feedback?]</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>I guess I should hear the opinions of our kkoma Kim Dokjas. But I didn’t hear the evaluations of the readers. Instead, I heard.</p>
<p>「rlaehrwk37 is saddened by your story.」</p>
<p>「rlaehrwk61 is saddened by your story.」</p>
<p>「rlaehrwk99 is saddened by your story.」</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I imagined the little readers reading this story in a movie theater, a library, or somewhere in a world I don’t know.</p>
<p>[Would you like to try to reproduce it?]</p>
<p>[If you fail to reproduce it, you will die.]</p>
<p>There is only one thing I wish for.</p>
<p>[You succeeded in recreating the scene.]</p>
<p>[You are leaving the 'Snowfield'.]</p>
<p>To make sure that this story I wrote and you read doesn’t become meaningless.</p>
<p>「At that moment, Kim Dokja ran.」</p>
<p>I ran with all my might. The magic power of my heart began to beat violently, and the power of the great story flowed over it like a wildfire.</p>
<p>「He was not a complete Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>I replayed the history of Kim Dokja in my head over and over again. I wondered what they would have done.</p>
<p>「But now he has met the 'Demon King of Salvation' and the 'Watcher of Light and Darkness'.」</p>
<p>So, in order to understand myself, you, and this world better, to endure all this tragedy without resenting it, I read the stories.</p>
<p>[The tale, 'Demon King of Salvation', continues its storytelling.]</p>
<p>[The Giant tale, 'Season of Light and Darkness', continues its storytelling.]</p>
<p>But their tale was too big, too grand, too loud for me to understand. Understanding was far away, like reaching out to a distant star.</p>
<p>That far awayness made me closer to Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>「Even if understanding is nothing more than the light of a star in the middle.」</p>
<p>"Ahhhhhhhh!"</p>
<p>I overcame the shock wave that flew into [Way of the Wind].</p>
<p>「As long as they don't give up understanding, humans can become anything.」</p>
<p>I broke through the shock wave that surged into [Jeon Inhwa].</p>
<p>「Yoo Joonghyuk proved it.」</p>
<p>By borrowing the power of the giant story, I temporarily split the dense lightning waves.</p>
<p>「Again, just like Kim Dokja proved it.」</p>
<p>I ran and ran. My thighs burst and my shoulders were torn, but I didn't care. It didn't hurt.</p>
<p>「That's how he reached the 'Time Fault Gate.'」</p>
<p>I saw a door. A door through which lightning waves were constantly pouring. Now, I just had to close that door.</p>
<p>Kwakwakwakwakwa!</p>
<p>I stepped through the wide-open doorway, canceling out the pouring lightning waves.</p>
<p>And at that moment.</p>
<p>「Kim Dokja thought. 'It's too late'.」</p>
<p>The second phase began.</p>
<p>「The second phase of the apocalypse, 'Flame Wave'.」</p>
<p>Beyond the shadow of the tail that was shaking as if mocking me, the second shock wave of the Final Dragon that would burn everything was coming. The heat was so hot that even the doorknob attached to the 'Time Fault Door' had melted.</p>
<p>「No matter how fast he moved, it couldn't be faster than the 'Flame Wave' starting.」</p>
<p>I saw the red-hot 'Time Fault Door'. The moment I grabbed that door, my hand would melt.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was no way for me to handle the 'Heat Wave' right now. It was impossible even if I used a [Bookmark] or activated the story.</p>
<p>I let out a bitter smile. I couldn't close the door by myself.</p>
<p>Unlike Kim Dokja of the 'Great Battle of Good and Evil,' I didn't have &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;.</p>
<p>「No, is there really no one else?」</p>
<p>Somehow, the back of my head felt hot. The heat wave is approaching from the front, and the back of my head feels hot.</p>
<p>I slowly opened my mouth, feeling the subtle heat.</p>
<p>"You managed to avoid getting on the train."</p>
<p>I knew you didn't.</p>
<p>Because I wrote it like that. I used every trick I could to make this guy come to his senses.</p>
<p>"You're a real fucking punk."</p>
<p>I grinned at Yoo Joonghyuk and said.</p>
<p>"I know. Please help me."</p>
<p>"Why should I do that?"</p>
<p>I know you'll help.</p>
<p>Because I wrote it like that.</p>
<p>"That way, the &lt;Star Stream&gt; won't be destroyed."</p>
<p>"I've always lived hoping this place would be destroyed."</p>
<p>I knew you'd say that.</p>
<p>Because I wrote it like that.</p>
<p>"Still, will you help me?"</p>
<p>The heat wave was right in front of me. With the end of a world right before my eyes, I grinned at him.</p>
<p>Then Yoo Joonghyuk said.</p>
<p>"I know your real name."</p>
<p>That wasn’t something I had written.</p>
