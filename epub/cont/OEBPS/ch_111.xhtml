<hr/>
<p>Noh Gyeonghwan moved forward one step at a time. Since he couldn't see in front of him, the world's scenery was complete darkness.</p>
<p>Noh Gyeonghwan muttered as he stretched deeper into the darkness.</p>
<p>"What is the scene like now?"</p>
<p>He didn't ask expecting an answer. But someone answered.</p>
<p>—It’s a flower arrangement, ahjussi.</p>
<p>The sound was so distant that he couldn't tell who it belonged to.</p>
<p>Noh Gyeonghwan heard that voice and imagined an invisible landscape. Then, one by one, flowers bloomed in the darkness.</p>
<p>Red marigolds blooming everywhere.</p>
<p>It was the flower that would kill him.</p>
<p>Noh Gyeonghwan said:</p>
<p>"It’s beautiful."</p>
<p>Noh Gyeonghwan thought about his wife who died after being hit by a meteorite.</p>
<p>He thinks about his wife who died in the flower garden and he dies.</p>
<p>If his life were a novel, wouldn't this be the place where his last sentence would be written?</p>
<p>Novel.</p>
<p>Noh Gyeonghwan recalled his daughter’s favorite novel.</p>
<p>He wishes this was also a story. He hopes someday his daughter reads this story and laughs. He wishes he could say something like that to his daughter.</p>
<p>See, this dad also appears in your favorite novel.</p>
<p>Noh Gyeonghwan smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>Jiyoon was probably dead.</p>
<p>He would have died in this life, just like his wife did.</p>
<p>He thought about his daughter's last days.</p>
<p>How painful was it? How lonely she must have been.</p>
<p>Noh Gyeonghwan gathered his strength once again and took his steps. Now he will soon be able to meet his wife and daughter.</p>
<p>To do so, he must end the story of Lee Dansu, not the human Noh Gyeonghwan.</p>
<p>'I am Lee Dansu.'</p>
<p>The name he received in the new world. What kind of life did the original owner of this body live?</p>
<p>He does not know.</p>
<p>However, his body was now at its limits and his consciousness continued to blur. It must be because too much blood was shed.</p>
<p>[The power of the star gem strengthens your body!]</p>
<p>If there weren't one star gem left, it wouldn't have been surprising if he didn’t collapse right away in this state.</p>
<p>The sound of the Lesser Dragon's breathing was getting closer.</p>
<p>A dizzying flowery scent reached the tip of his nose.</p>
<p>Lee Dansu finally remembered the name of one man.</p>
<p>'Inho-ssi, I'm sorry.'</p>
<p>And that moment.</p>
<p>The voice became clearer.</p>
<p>—I see you can hear me now.</p>
<p>The voice that said earlier that this place was a flower garden. Lee Dansu knew the owner of that voice.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi?"</p>
<p>I answered.</p>
<p>—Yes, it’s me.</p>
<p>Lee Dansu looked around even though he knew he was blind. The man’s voice was trembling.</p>
<p>"How did you wake up? You shouldn't be here. If you don't get back on the scaffolding-"</p>
<p>—I am safe. The important thing now is you.</p>
<p>"I’m done now."</p>
<p>The voice of someone who has already let go of life.</p>
<p>Lee Dansu's eyes were blind, and every part of his body was necrotic. The muscles in his limbs fell into clumps.</p>
<p>But the reason he wants to give up on life may not be because of his crippled body.</p>
<p>"Why is the world killing my family?"</p>
<p>I didn't know what to say.</p>
<p>What would Yoo Joonghyuk have said?</p>
<p>「"As soon as the scenario begins, there is a dead boy. Are you more unhappy? Or is the boy more unfortunate? What is the meaning of fighting over misfortune in this world?"」</p>
<p>What would Han Sooyoung say?</p>
<p>「"All misfortunes are ordinary. It looks special because it was captured in a story."」</p>
<p>But I couldn't talk like them.</p>
<p>Those words weren't what he needed.</p>
<p>"I don’t want to live anymore."</p>
<p>The reason I want Lee Dansu to live longer here is probably just my greed for liking him.</p>
<p>—Ahjussi.</p>
<p>I know. Even if he survives here, his misfortune will not go away.</p>
<p>He will have to endure life.</p>
<p>He will have to live in a world without his wife and daughter.</p>
<p>What does it mean to him? Can I make that meaning? How dare I do something like that?</p>
<p>Even though I was thinking about that, I couldn't suppress this greed.</p>
<p>「I want to write a novel.」</p>
<p>Sitting in an unknown theater, I wanted to show the next story to readers who, like me, were hoping that the man would survive. I started writing sentences.</p>
<p>「What kind of person was my father?」</p>
<p>Lee Dansu trembled with excitement and looked up into empty space.</p>
<p>「My mom died after being hit by a meteorite and my dad got cancer.」</p>
<p>The man's lips closing again and again.</p>
<p>「Are we a cursed family?」</p>
<p>Even a man who can't see anything will hear that sentence.</p>
<p>"Who just said that…"</p>
<p>The uncle stuttered in disbelief and then he asked:</p>
<p>"Is it Jiyoon?"</p>
<p>—Yes.</p>
<p>"Jiyoon, is she alive?"</p>
<p>I hesitated to answer.</p>
<p>If I answer honestly, the truth will take away his last hope.</p>
<p>But if I tell a lie, is it a lie that can be forgiven?</p>
<p>I blinked slowly.</p>
<p>And I thought about a person's heart, not about truth or lies.</p>
<p>「"Please save my father, Kim Dokja."」</p>
<p>A daughter's wish for her father to survive. I thought of a sentence that would represent that feeling.</p>
<p>—Yes.</p>
<p>This world is the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p>A world created by the author, readers, and protagonist together.</p>
<p>A world where it is possible for dead people to come back to life, to go against time, and to be reborn as a different person.</p>
<p>At least in this world.</p>
<p>-Yes, she is alive.</p>
<p>This is not a lie.</p>
<p>—For that to happen, you must survive first.</p>
<p>Spores were spreading rapidly in the air. It will now take less than 30 seconds for spores to cover the entire area.</p>
<p>"B-but how…"</p>
<p>The voice of an impatient man.</p>
<p>I possessed the man's body as if I would jump into the ocean behind him if I calmly took a breath.</p>
<p>[Stage 3 of 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' is strongly activated!]</p>
<p>The man’s eyes shone brightly. In the place where his eyes disappeared, pupils formed from clusters of light appeared.</p>
<p>"I can see it!"</p>
<p>It was my eyes.</p>
<p>—Run!</p>
<p>Ahjussi and I ran to avoid the spores. I continued running, being careful not to step on the flower buds on the floor.</p>
<p>—Coat!</p>
<p>The man picked up the coat that had fallen on the floor. It was my white coat that fell off while dodging the attack of the poisonous species earlier.</p>
<p>—There’s a brown bottle in my inner pocket!</p>
<p>The man immediately found the item I mentioned.</p>
<p>Sidok Kobulo's Horn Powder.</p>
<p>A consumable item with a poison neutralizing effect.</p>
<p>—Spores ahead! Dodge to the right! Pick up a book next to it!</p>
<p>There was something that looked like a small booklet rolling around on the floor where I pointed. It was an item dropped by the men of the king who died earlier.</p>
<p>[Item 'Donguibogam Miscellaneous Soldiers' was acquired.]</p>
<p>The groups gathered here are probably the ones who cleared the 5-person dungeon 'Donguibogam’s Field'.</p>
<p>[Item 'Donguibogam Bedding' was acquired.]</p>
<p>A total of 9 books by Donguibogam fell on the floor.</p>
<p>[Item 'Donguibogam'. The effect of 'incomplete version' is in effect.]</p>
<p>And Donguibogam is an item that activates the poison ability when you collect more than 8 pieces.</p>
<p>[Your body temporarily develops its own poisoning ability.]</p>
<p>I could feel the man's breathing getting easier. But this is nothing more than buying time.</p>
<p>Even if 'Sideuk Kobulo's Horn Powder' and 'Donguibogam' create synergy, not even 30 trillion will be able to be produced in these spores.</p>
<p>The man's body was turning brown after being touched by the spores.</p>
<p>Grrrr…</p>
<p>At that moment, the dragon, who sensed something unusual, also looked this way.</p>
<p>An additional phase is triggered when the man does not die despite its attack.</p>
<p>The poisonous dragon species let out a harsh cry into the air and let out its breath.</p>
<p>"Hey, Inho-ssi."</p>
<p>The man's complexion turned pale as he watched his breath fall like acid rain.</p>
<p>I reassured the man.</p>
<p>—It's okay. Run, hurry!</p>
<p>"Can I continue living?"</p>
<p>—We must meet Jiyoon again!</p>
<p>The man gasped without answering. That short silence was telling me.</p>
<p>Ahjussi already knows everything.</p>
<p>"Even if I survive, I will continue to be a burden to Inho-ssi."</p>
<p>A burden. Lee Dansu thought of himself that way.</p>
<p>—Ahjussi.</p>
<p>Killer King looked at him with [eyes of sin].</p>
<p>It is said that Lee Dansu had a pure white soul, as if he were wearing a white coat.</p>
<p>I could read the footsteps of the pure white soul.</p>
<p>「"Could you please tell me how to catch bugs?"」</p>
<p>A person who has completed 'Proof of Worth' by killing bugs on the subway.</p>
<p>「"Do you really have to kill others?"」</p>
<p>Lee Dansu, alone, defended his beliefs in a scenario where everyone was killing each other.</p>
<p>「"I won’t kill you. I won’t kill you."」</p>
<p>A person who ate the 'star jewel' and became a monster, but did not kill anyone in the end.</p>
<p>—None of us lived like you.</p>
<p>In this world, one person's life soon becomes a story.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' looks at incarnation 'Lee Dansu'.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' watches incarnation 'Lee Dansu'.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' supports the history of incarnation 'Lee Dansu'.]</p>
<p>However, in order to prove the story, a 'qualification' is needed.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' nods.]</p>
<p>A 'qualification' to prove that ahjussi’s story is worth recording.</p>
<p>That qualification was rolling around on the floor.</p>
<p>—Run! Pick it up! Hurry!</p>
<p>With my shout, the man picked up the 'brown flag' that had fallen on the floor.</p>
<p>A soft light shone all over Lee Dansu’s whole body.</p>
<p>[Incarnation 'Lee Dansu' took the 'brown flag'.]</p>
<p>[The King's Road begins!]</p>
<p>Acidic liquid fell from the air and poured down on the man's head. An attack that cannot be neutralized even with 'Donguibogam' or 'Sideuk Kobulo's Horn Powder'.</p>
<p>[The shield is activated by the effect of the 'brown flag'.]</p>
<p>A shield stretched out in the air blocked the acid breath.</p>
<p>I quickly looked around.</p>
<p>A total of eight flags fell to the ground. They were all dropped by dead kings.</p>
<p>In order to complete 'King’s Path' in this world line, we must achieve the 'Black Flag'.</p>
<p>—Pick it all up!</p>
<p>Every time a new flag is picked up, the color of the man's flag starts to change.</p>
<p>Dark brown, heat purple, purple, dark purple, and-</p>
<p>The man's body, caught on a stone, rolled on the floor. The sound of a flower bud bursting as it is crushed. The thick spores began to stick to the man's entire body.</p>
<p>"Ah."</p>
<p>Flowers grew on the man's skin. The wildflowers were blooming continuously, giving off a strong scent. The man’s magic began to disappear rapidly.</p>
<p>[Incarnation 'Lee Dansu' achieved the 'Black Flag'.]</p>
<p>The sound of breathing coming slowly.</p>
<p>I could feel the man’s fear.</p>
<p>Now even ahjussi knew.</p>
<p>What will happen from now on?</p>
<p>And what was my plan?</p>
<p>[The key conditions for 'The King’s Road' are unlocked.]</p>
<p>I don't know whether this operation will succeed or not.</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>The man covered in red petals smiled as if he knew how I felt.</p>
<p>「This is a path that only Lee Dansu can take in this world. And for this method to succeed, ahjussi must die once.」</p>
<p>Death.</p>
<p>I don't know what that is. Maybe I don't even want to know.</p>
<p>Is that something that can be 'experienced'? What happens after you go through that?</p>
<p>—Ahjussi, don’t worry.</p>
<p>No one knows that except Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>—I will be with you.</p>
<p>We will soon find out.</p>
<p>"Friend."</p>
<p>With the man's last words, my vision darkened completely.</p>
<p>A pitch-black void has arrived. A phrase with nothing written in it.</p>
<p>I called ahjussi over and over again. But Lee Dansu had no answer.</p>
<p>[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint has an abnormal reaction!]</p>
<p>Am I alive now or am I dead?</p>
<p>If it's none of the two.</p>
<p>Am I just looking at a huge wall?</p>
<p>I fumbled along the endless wall, searching like a madman for print that I could read.</p>
<p>And the next moment.</p>
<p>Black. With that feeling, the darkness sucked me in. The surroundings became brighter. I was in the labyrinth again.</p>
<p>[A new king was born.]</p>
<p>[You made a decisive contribution to the birth of a new king.]</p>
<p>[The &lt;Star Stream&gt; reassesses your story.]</p>
<p>[A new 'loss' is recorded on the 'Final Wall'.]</p>
<p>A dazzling light was shining through the fluttering red flower petals.</p>
<p>Inside, the body of Lee Dansu was being reconstructed.</p>
<p>「Now, it was the moment when a new 'King of No Killing' was born.」</p>
