<hr/>
<p>As the chatter of &lt;Asgard&gt; subsided, the sky over Ginnungagap was covered in silence again.</p>
<p>A sky where no star dares to shine.</p>
<p>It was not simply because the veil of 'Ginnungagap' hid the starlight. Beyond that veil, there was a being that caught the light of all the stars.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja burst into laughter under his breath.</p>
<p>"Look, you can’t do that."</p>
<p>The historical-grade Constellation remained silent, unable to respond to those words.</p>
<p>They probably felt it too.</p>
<p>Just now, a Constellation from &lt;Asgard&gt; fell from beyond the sky of 'Ginnungagap'. I don't know what the Constellation's modifier or true name is. However, judging from the reactions of the historical-grade Constellation, it seems that he is not a weak guy.</p>
<p>That Constellation fell all at once.</p>
<p>'Is Yoo Joonghyuk over there?'</p>
<p>Kim Dokja looked up at the sky without answering.</p>
<p>What Kim Dokja can see, I can also see. However, Yoo Joonghyuk was not visible in Kim Dokja's eyes. All that was reflected in my eyes was a landscape that looked like a pitch-black blackout curtain.</p>
<p>—There is.</p>
<p>Still, we could imagine.</p>
<p>The fragments recovered by Kim Dokja were talking to us.</p>
<p>「"Kim Dokja. Are you there?"」</p>
<p>It was a voice from the distant past.</p>
<p>Words that his colleagues once searched for him with.</p>
<p>「"Dokja-ssi."」</p>
<p>「"Ahjussi! Can you hear me? Ahjussi!"」</p>
<p>Since this world line did not allow communication with them, their voices were nothing more than auditory hallucinations created by Kim Dokja's memories.</p>
<p>Still, we knew. Even if the voice is different, even if the pitch and content of the words are different, &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; is looking for Kim Dokja beyond the stage.</p>
<p>Because this is 'that kind of story'.</p>
<p>—In the end, all that remains is the story.</p>
<p>This story is all about Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>'Do you miss them?'</p>
<p>The agitation felt like a faint ripple and then subsided.</p>
<p>—I told you. That's not my responsibility.</p>
<p>Suddenly my emotions soared.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p>You don't have to be that kind of person. There is no reason why you have to be the only 'Kim Dokja' like that.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I understood what he was saying.</p>
<p>His story was telling.</p>
<p>「This is the way of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.」</p>
<p>He can only say that. From the time he was born, he had no choice but to live like that.</p>
<p>Just like that stubborn Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>At that moment, this thought occurred to me.</p>
<p>If every 'Kim Dokja' had his own role. If you live a story appropriate for that role.</p>
<p>So what is my role as 'Kim Dokja'?</p>
<p>['Ginnungagap' will be lifted soon.]</p>
<p>The pitch-black sky was shaking.</p>
<p>The first thing that came to me was relief that I had survived.</p>
<p>When this 'stage' is lifted, the Constellations will no longer be able to harm us.</p>
<p>Even if it was a scenario where the scale of probability was at play, even if the opponent was &lt;Asgard&gt;, one of the three powers of the 'Nebula', there was no way they could have suffered a bigger loss than this.</p>
<p>However, the historical-grade Constellation showed no sign of giving up yet.</p>
<p>[Don’t bluff. No great being can cross that veil now.]</p>
<p>Valkyrie's daughter was right.</p>
<p>In order for the Yoo Joonghyuk I know to descend here, at least a Mythical Constellation would have to appear and balance the scales.</p>
<p>But there is no way that 'Odin' would appear here just to catch us.</p>
<p>"That means the Constellations can’t come to help you."</p>
<p>[There is no need for help from other Constellations. Because we alone are enough to hunt you down.]</p>
<p>"The three of them were torn apart earlier."</p>
<p>At those words, a bright roar flowed from 'Valkyrie's Daughter', who inherited the status of the seven historical-grade Constellation.</p>
<p>[I know what the 'old you' looked like.]</p>
<p>The old Kim Dokja?</p>
<p>[I have seen it several times in the stories of the Mythical Constellations that hunted you. It was so fascinating that I couldn't help but watch it over and over again. In that story, you were truly beautiful.]</p>
<p>I was wondering.</p>
<p>Is Kim Dokja's true identity really as they claim?</p>
<p>Even if it remains as a 'story', there is no guarantee that the incident was true.</p>
<p>In some stories, the facts are contaminated by false propaganda.</p>
<p>'Valkyrie’s Daughter' continued speaking in a cold voice.</p>
<p>[You are imitating God well despite the skin that God has shed.]</p>
<p>Those words struck my heart in a strange way.</p>
<p>"Imitate."</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation laughed without denying those words in any way.</p>
<p>The air around us began to vibrate. Seven Constellations, led by 'Valkyrie's Daughter', were approaching with all their might.</p>
<p>'Ginnungagap' is not over yet.</p>
<p>'What are you going to do?'</p>
<p>Three Constellations have already left. The remaining historical-grade Constellation will now risk their life to attack.</p>
<p>'If I use that skill one more time—'</p>
<p>—Then you’ll die.</p>
<p>I know. But there is no other way.</p>
<p>—There is a way.</p>
<p>'Valkyrie's Daughter' flew into the air and threw out a spear, spewing out chills. A fierce gust of wind struck my waist as if the space around me was being compressed.</p>
<p>It's enormous.</p>
<p>Even if it is not a Mythical-grade attack, if it is an attack of this level, one hit will kill me instantly.</p>
<p>Even in that situation, Kim Dokja was still smirking.</p>
<p>"Seven of you attack someone with nothing but fault? If we do this, we’ll have no choice but to call our side."</p>
<p>[There is no one on your side here—]</p>
<p>Kim Dokja put his hand into his chest and threw something toward the front.</p>
<p>Acrid smoke spread out with a small explosion sound.</p>
<p>'Poison Bomb.'</p>
<p>It was a trophy obtained when dealing with the Misreading association guys in the Star Labyrinth.</p>
<p>Naturally, it was an item that would not cause any harm to the Constellations.</p>
<p>[With just this insignificant skill!]</p>
<p>"Insignificant skill?"</p>
<p>The Constellations, startled by Kim Dokja's words, stopped for a moment.</p>
<p>Then, instead of running straight this way, they started creating wind pressure to blow away the smoke from the poisonous bomb.</p>
<p>They suspected that Kim Dokja might have set a trap.</p>
<p>But that was exactly the effect Kim Dokja was aiming for.</p>
<p>"Anna Croft."</p>
<p>Anna Croft, who was standing in the back, trembled at Kim Dokja's call.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja said, reaching out his hand toward her.</p>
<p>"Heart."</p>
<p>The processing of the 'Lesser Dragon’s Heart' that I requested earlier has just been completed.</p>
<p>Valkyrie's daughter, who witnessed the scene, warned.</p>
<p>[Prophet! What are you trying to do now!]</p>
<p>Anna Croft's movements stopped at the bloody voice.</p>
<p>[I'm sure you're not trying to betray &lt;Asgard&gt;.]</p>
<p>At those words, both Anna Croft, Selena Kim, and Christina Page who were by her side turned pale.</p>
<p>[Have you forgotten whose incarnation you are?]</p>
<p>The reason 'Zarathustra' was able to become as strong as it is now is because of the support of the Nebula &lt;Asgard&gt;.</p>
<p>Helping me in a situation where I and &lt;Asgard&gt; were at a loss was tantamount to betraying the Nebula behind her.</p>
<p>Anna Croft's 'Eye of the Great Evil' was seen turning red for a moment.</p>
<p>Tsutsutsu.</p>
<p>Anna Croft stumbled, frowning as sparks flew through the air.</p>
<p>She attempted to read the future with [Future Sight]. Judging by the expression on his face, [Future Sight] probably failed.</p>
<p>Anna Croft, who looked at us for a moment, lowered her head and said.</p>
<p>"I am definitely the incarnation of &lt;Asgard&gt;."</p>
<p>I understood.</p>
<p>In the seventh scenario, it was obvious what the price would be for betraying the third-tier Giant Nebula.</p>
<p>If she helps us now, Anna's group will be defeated. So her judgment now was extremely reasonable.</p>
<p>"But."</p>
<p>Anna Croft slowly raised her head, looked at 'Valkyrie's Daughter' and continued her words.</p>
<p>"I’m not sure if you can represent &lt;Asgard&gt;."</p>
<p>The moment I looked into Anna Croft's eyes, I slowly got goosebumps.</p>
<p>I forgot for a moment.</p>
<p>That she is a 'Gambler in Las Vegas'.</p>
<p>[What are you saying now?]</p>
<p>"This stage is from the beginning, 'Ginnungagap', what happened here is not recorded. Since it is not handed down, no one outside can know what happened here."</p>
<p>Anna Croft has just placed a bet.</p>
<p>"If you all die here, who will remember what I did?"</p>
<p>[What nonsense are you talking about? Prophet!]</p>
<p>A gamble with little chance.</p>
<p>A situation in which a normal 'Anna Croft' would never have intervened.</p>
<p>And yet now, Anna Croft has placed her entire stake on the conman she hates the most.</p>
<p>"Cheon Inho. Can you do it?"</p>
<p>I don’t know if Cheon Inho can do it or not. However, it was not Cheon Inho who was answering now.</p>
<p>"It is possible."</p>
<p>The Constellations realized something was wrong and shouted.</p>
<p>[Attack!]</p>
<p>In the meantime, we received the 'Refined Lesser Dragon Heart' from Anna Croft.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask her.</p>
<p>Why did you decide to help us?</p>
<p>In a situation where there is no future in sight, what on earth did you believe and bet on us?</p>
<p>"In no round was I recognized as a 'companion' by the Supreme King."</p>
<p>Anna Croft's gaze was focused on the fallen Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>"If such a powerful king recognized you as a comrade, there must be a good reason."</p>
<p>Anna Croft had a feeling that this round was the end of the world lines. Therefore, she may also have taken her last gamble.</p>
<p>"Joonghyuk has an eye for people."</p>
<p>The Constellations that cleared away the poisonous fog each fired their weapons.</p>
<p>The one that flew first was again the spear fired by 'Valkyrie’s Daughter'.</p>
<p>The thunderous strike contained in the weapon flew over, turning the entire floor over.</p>
<p>[Kill! Recover the fragments!]</p>
<p>Kim Dokja dodged the spear and immediately swallowed the 'Lesser Dragon's Heart'.</p>
<p>[Use 'Refined Lesser Dragon’s Heart'.]</p>
<p>My heart was beating loudly and my body was shaking violently. The magical power emanating from the dragon's heart was merging with my heart. Like the fable of a chrysalis becoming a butterfly, I felt my body breaking through its limits.</p>
<p>[Your body evolves!]</p>
<p>[The story of the 'Braqui Clan' dwells in your heart.]</p>
<p>But the opponents were Constellations.</p>
<p>It was not possible to overcome the defense just by absorbing a single 'Lesser Dragon's Heart' and increasing the amount of magical power.</p>
<p>The weapon that had passed us was flying back to us across the distant sky.</p>
<p>Considering that the range of the lightning discharged was larger than before, it seemed difficult to avoid it by fluke.</p>
<p>This time we have to hit with all our might.</p>
<p>—Youngest.</p>
<p>'Yes.'</p>
<p>The moment my heart beat loudly, the dragon's heart carried rough magical energy throughout my body.</p>
<p>As I felt pain due to torn blood vessels, pages started turning in my head.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]</p>
<p>We are Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>Readers fight in their own way.</p>
<p>—The person we need right now.</p>
<p>'It's a monster that can take on seven historical-grade Constellations.'</p>
<p>—It’s hard to do just that. The physical size doesn't match, so the cost of class is too high.</p>
<p>'It won't work even with a broken sword.'</p>
<p>A character who can defeat seven historical-grade Constellation.</p>
<p>There were many people that came to mind, but it was hard to think of anyone who could take them down without unduly harming the balance of the scales.</p>
<p>—There is one.</p>
<p>But will it work? That person is a 'Constellation'.</p>
<p>Originally, [Bookmark] only works on 'characters'.</p>
<p>In fact, in the Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, Kim Dokja never once borrowed the power of 'Constellations' as a bookmark.</p>
<p>—Maybe, because I happened to get the 'Dragon Heart' too.</p>
<p>But it wasn't impossible.</p>
<p>There was definitely an increase in understanding of bookmarks for 'Constellations'.</p>
<p>'Then let's do it.'</p>
<p>An existence that is at the limit that my current body can handle and that the probability of the scale allows.</p>
<p>「"This guy was born to be a businessman."」</p>
<p>As the pages stopped turning, his history filled my ears.</p>
<p>「"I was born with the blood of a dragon."」</p>
<p>In the main story, there was no opportunity to borrow his power as a 'bookmark'.</p>
<p>This is because there was insufficient understanding.</p>
<p>[You possess the 'Dragon Heart'.]</p>
<p>[Your body specifications are similar to the person's body specifications.]</p>
<p>But what about now?</p>
<p>[Bookmark number 21 is activated.]</p>
<p>My heart was pounding loudly and my vision was distorted.</p>
<p>The rushing Constellations shouted as if they were struggling.</p>
<p>[I don’t know what you’re trying to do—]</p>
<p>[Kill him! At best, he can only use the power of a historical-grade Constellation!]</p>
<p>At best, he is a historical-grade Constellation.</p>
<p>However, even historical-grade Constellation have a hierarchy.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Three Swords Lv. ???' is activated!]</p>
<p>He is the most powerful Constellation.</p>
<p>He is a being who has never swung his sword at the same opponent more than three times in his life.</p>
<p>A warrior who cut down a thousand people with one sword, collapsed a mountain with two swords, and split the sea with three swords.</p>
<p>[Bookmark number 21 'Goryeo First Sword Cheok Jungyeong' is activated!]</p>
<p>The Constellation at the rear, who belatedly realized something, shouted.</p>
<p>[Wait, stop! Valkyrie's daughter! Something is wrong! Now he is—]</p>
<p>Before he could even finish his words, the entire landscape in front of him was torn apart.</p>
