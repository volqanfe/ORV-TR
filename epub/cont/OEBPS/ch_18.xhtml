<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">570 Episode 3. Protagonist(?) (7)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>"They say there's nothing ahead."</p>
<p>Thanks to the cockroaches' forewarning of danger, we were able to move at a faster pace than before.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein said admiringly.</p>
<p>"The cockroaches are so OP."</p>
<p>"What's OP?"</p>
<p>"That...... It's too good, so maybe your sponsor is more useful than I thought?"</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' grumbles asking 'Did you realize that just now?']</p>
<p>Things certainly weren't bad.</p>
<p>At this point, Dansoo ahjussi could easily play the role of Lee Gilyoung in the main story.</p>
<p>We walked for about ten minutes.</p>
<p>He stopped for the first time.</p>
<p>"There's something up ahead."</p>
<p>We gasped in unison.</p>
<p>A few cockroaches scurried toward him, their antennae twitching violently.</p>
<p>"I think it's one ground rat."</p>
<p>I didn't think there were ground rats in this section.</p>
<p>I thought for a moment and said.</p>
<p>"Let's wait, maybe it's one that got separated from the mischief and is wandering around."</p>
<p>I didn't want to risk an encounter. We waited, hiding ourselves.</p>
<p>1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes.</p>
<p>The ground rat showed no sign of going away.</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi looked a little tired, as if he'd used [Diverse Communication] too many times in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>"What shall we do?"</p>
<p>Oksu Station was just around the corner. It would be a shame to turn back here.</p>
<p>"Let's catch it, it's only one."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein suggested first.</p>
<p>"We have to fight at some point, and we can't go through the scenario without catching one. It's a monster that Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung also caught, so let's not be scared."</p>
<p>Turns out she was right.</p>
<p>Lightly stretching her shoulders and neck, Kyung Sein continued.</p>
<p>"If you have any useful skills, show them all instead of hiding them. For reference, I have [Average Correction]."</p>
<p>As expected, I thought that if she was a complete reader, she would have at least one hidden hand.</p>
<p>By the way, [Average Correction].</p>
<p>It's a skill that wasn't detailed in Omniscient Reader, but I remembered setting it up.</p>
<p>"It's a little tricky to explain, but if you raise one of your stats, the rest of your stats will be corrected to 70% of your highest stats. For example, if you raise your physique level to 10, you'll have a performance level of 7 without leveling up strength or agility."</p>
<p>"Huh, that's a pretty cool skill."</p>
<p>It was definitely a powerful skill. It meant that from now on, Kyung Sein could go all-in on just one main stat.</p>
<p>In the early stages, when coins are hard to come by for stats, there's no better skill.</p>
<p>"I only have the [Diverse Communication] I showed you earlier....... What about my mate?"</p>
<p>I checked my skills one by one.</p>
<p>[■■]</p>
<p>[Character List]</p>
<p>[Incite]</p>
<p>These were the only three skills I knew.</p>
<p>Sometimes I hear a character's inner thoughts, so I think there's a skill that's similar to [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint], but I haven't figured out how to activate it yet.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, my skills are all related to inciting through speech. As you can see, it's Cheon Inho."</p>
<p>"Phew, it can't be helped, but it's not a bad situation. There are three of us and one of it, so on the signal of one, two, three, we'll all run and beat it up."</p>
<p>"Let's be careful not to get hurt."</p>
<p>We looked at each other and cautiously approached the ground rat.</p>
<p>We must have taken thirty steps.</p>
<p>The shadow of a monster emerged from the darkness.</p>
<p>「The size of a fully-grown wolf. A mole-like creature with developed forepaws.」</p>
<p>There was no mistaking it.</p>
<p>It was a 9th grade underground species, the ground rat.</p>
<p>But...... Was it that big?</p>
<p>"Uh, wait a minute."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein also stopped walking as if she noticed something strange.</p>
<p>Kooooo.</p>
<p>An ominous howl.</p>
<p>A pair of yellow eyes glowed in the darkness, and a boar-like creature charged toward us. The ground rumbled lightly, and stones bounced off the bottom of the track.</p>
<p>The frail Kim Dokja had actually caught a monster like this?</p>
<p>"Hiyoooop!"</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi let out a strange shout and swung his pipe in an excited gesture.</p>
<p>But his weak pipe grazed the ground rat's face and bounced off.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi!"</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi barely rolled out of the way of the collision.</p>
<p>I was next.</p>
<p>Come.</p>
<p>Despite this, my strength level is 10. There's no way I can't catch a monster that even a kid like Lee Gilyoung could catch.</p>
<p>I swung the pipe with all my might, but it missed. The moment the blow hit, the ground rat quickly lowered its head.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>I spun around and landed on my butt.</p>
<p>When I quickly raised my head, the ground rat was running past me toward the target. It had instinctively chosen the weakest-looking prey among us.</p>
<p>"Sein-ssi!"</p>
<p>The terrified Kyung Sein held up her pipe, her arms shaking.</p>
<p>"Uh, Uwaaaak!"</p>
<p>Throwing the pipe, Kyung Sein turned around and started running.</p>
<p>"What are you doing! Catch it!"</p>
<p>"H-How can I catch something like that!"</p>
<p>What a difference between fiction and reality.</p>
<p>Is that really the same beast that Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung fought?</p>
<p>Kyung Sein, who was running fast, tripped over the tracks and fell. The ground rat didn't miss the opportunity, howled, and hit her.</p>
<p>With a thud, she bounced off and hit the wall of the train tracks.</p>
<p>I thought she was dead, but to my surprise, Kyung Sein staggered to her feet.</p>
<p>"Uaaaa! It hurts! It hurts!"</p>
<p>The reason was obvious.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein had gone all-in on her physique.</p>
<p>Just as I had invested my coins in strength, she had invested all of her coins in physique.</p>
<p>"Don't run, pick up your weapon! Over here! You bastard!"</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.2' is activated.]</p>
<p>I activated [Incite] half-heartedly, and it turned to look in my direction. It didn't seem to understand me, but at least I'd turned off its aggression.</p>
<p>With Kyung Sein haphazardly picking up her weapon, Dansoo ahjussi and I formed a chaotic formation.</p>
<p>Luckily, the ground rat only let out a snarl and didn't try to charge again.</p>
<p>"You said you were going to be a man worthy of Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p>"Heewon-nim is strong, I can help her as a wife!"</p>
<p>"You've killed people, you can't just run away like that."</p>
<p>I wish I hadn't said that.</p>
<p>Pale and fed up, Kyung Sein asked.</p>
<p>"I killed a man? Who told you that?"</p>
<p>"Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p>"I...... I just closed my eyes and finished the kid Heewon-nim left half dead."</p>
<p>As I watched Kyung Sein's shaking hand holding the pipe, it all made sense.</p>
<p>That was why Jung Heewon had such a strong expression on her face.</p>
<p>"If you really don't want to die, make up your mind."</p>
<p>The plan was a complete failure.</p>
<p>There was no way an ordinary reader in real life could possess someone in a novel and suddenly start acting like Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>「I wonder how many of them survived.」</p>
<p>Just as the sudden anxiety was taking over my mind, Dansoo ahjussi called out to me in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>"I-Inho-ssi."</p>
<p>The ground rat that had been confronting us had four eyes now.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>He'd called for his colleague.</p>
<p>"Turn around."</p>
<p>We started running toward Geumho Station. But the chasing ground rats were faster.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi! Hurry!"</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi, who has relatively low physique and strength, lagged behind. I slowed down a bit to keep pace with him.</p>
<p>That's when I heard a squeak. I looked to the side and saw a ground rat nibbling at the hem of my clothes.</p>
<p>It seemed to be bleeding profusely.</p>
<p>I couldn't believe I was going to die like this, not from a monster, but from an earth rat. At the same time, I realized that I wanted to write a novel about this story.</p>
<p>「The Ultimate Omniscient Reader Party. Wiped out by a 9th grade underground species, the ground rat.」</p>
<p>But who would read such a novel?</p>
<p>I let out a shout and smashed the ground rat's head with my pipe. But its grip was stronger than I thought.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi! Run! Come on!"</p>
<p>I can't take on both of them with all my might now. It's even more impossible for me alone.</p>
<p>At least I can buy some time.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.2' is strongly activated!]</p>
<p>My skill once again drew the attention of the ground rats.</p>
<p>I gripped the pipe with both hands like a baseball bat and slammed it into the side of one of them. It squirmed in pain and fell from me.</p>
<p>The problem was the other one.</p>
<p>In an ominous flash of foreboding, a large shadow leaped up behind me. It was too late to react.</p>
<p>"Get out of the way!"</p>
<p>With a sharp voice, a pipe flew out of nowhere and pierced the ground rat's eye.</p>
<p>Kuaaaak!</p>
<p>The sharpened end of the pipe went straight through the ground rat's skull and out the other side.</p>
<p>The pipe was pulled straight out and left an efficient trajectory toward the second ground rat.</p>
<p>I knew the identity of that trace.</p>
<p>A skill that was dismissed as insignificant in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>[Kendo(劍道)]</p>
<p>However, there were some characters who practiced it to the limit and finally slit the throats of demons.</p>
<p>The flowing trace of the pipe sliced through the head of the staggering second ground rat.</p>
<p>As it collapsed, the red glow extinguished from its eyes as it looked at me.</p>
<p>"I knew this would happen."</p>
<p>Last time, I thought I couldn't help it even if Ji Eunyoo teased me. This time, I thought I might actually fall in love with her.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?"</p>
<p>It was Jung Heewon.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Sniff sniff, Heewon unni, I mean, it was so hard for us."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein held on to Jung Heewon and sobbed for a long time. I thought I was really going to die. Why did she come now?</p>
<p>"Thanks to you, I'm alive. I didn't know they were so strong......."</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi also thanked her, exhausted.</p>
<p>I did the same.</p>
<p>"You saved my life, you really put up a good fight."</p>
<p>"Are your wounds okay?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It's nothing, thankfully."</p>
<p>Luckily, the ground rat's teeth had only scratched my side.</p>
<p>Still, if Jung Heewon hadn't come, I would have died there.</p>
<p>I completely miscalculated our power. I didn't expect the readers party to be so crappy.</p>
<p>"I came here because I was worried. I saw two weak men and a small girl leaving as a scouting party..... I was honestly nervous."</p>
<p>Apparently, Jung Heewon was the only one who objectively grasped our party's strength.</p>
<p>However, the previous battle was surprising even when I thought about it again.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon was this strong.</p>

</fieldset>
<p>I can't believe that 'Cheon Inho' is trusted by Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>Life really is hard to understand.</p>
<p>"But why did you move in such a hurry?"</p>
<p>Jung Heewon's question made Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi look at me at the same time.</p>
<p>"Because we have to rescue the survivors."</p>
<p>"Survivors?"</p>
<p>"There's someone I know near Oksu Station."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon nodded as if she understood.</p>
<p>"I see. Your parents, your family?"</p>
<p>"If I had to say...... They're like family."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi looked at me and nodded.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon said.</p>
<p>"If that's the case, I'll help you too."</p>
<p>"I'd really appreciate it."</p>
<p>I thought it would be okay to go with Jung Heewon. She was going to be a main member of Kim Dokja's Company, so there was no harm if she accompanied us in advance.</p>
<p>However, there was something I needed to do before I left again.</p>
<p>I looked down at the bodies of the two fallen ground rats.</p>
<p>"Hmm? What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>There were two main reasons why our party was so unsuccessful.</p>
<p>One, the lack of main combat skills, and two.</p>
<p>"Let's make weapons."</p>
<p>As if something had come to their mind, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi jumped out of their seats.</p>
<p>It must have been the development of the main story.</p>
<p>However, Kyung Sein's expression brightened for a moment, and then quickly darkened.</p>
<p>"But...... Inho-ssi."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Do you know how to do it?"</p>
<p>That was the problem.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Ground rat's spine sword! Ground rat's spine sword!"</p>
<p>Kyung Sein had been repeating the words like a mantra for several minutes now, holding the head of a ground rat.</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi asked.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"I'm trying to do something."</p>
<p>I think she has watched too many cartoons.</p>
<p>I left Kyung Sein alone and took out the knife I had borrowed from the Cheoldoo Group earlier.</p>
<p>Then I used Incite on myself.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv2' is activated!]</p>
<p>「This isn't gross at all. I'm a professional butcher.」</p>
<p>I grabbed the ground rat by the head and started tearing off its skin. Honestly, I was worried because I've never done any butchering before, but it wasn't as hard as I thought.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, I realized that the skin had a dotted line along the spine. Like a creature made to be cut along the dotted line.</p>
<p>I thought that this was enough for people who hadn't read 'Ways of Survival' like Kim Dokja, then I turned to the side and saw Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi gagging.</p>
<p>Oh well, that's normal.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, on the other hand, stuck to my side and watched the whole grooming process with interest.</p>
<p>"Where did you learn to do this?"</p>
<p>"Self-taught."</p>
<p>"Wow......."</p>
<p>My shoulders got tense for no reason.</p>
<p>I must be pretty talented, right? Jung Heewon added with a wry smile.</p>
<p>"But since you're self-taught, you're not very good at it."</p>
<p>"Don't bully me."</p>
<p>I grunted for about twenty minutes.</p>
<p>With a snap, the first ground rat's spine was cleanly separated.</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi was impressed.</p>
<p>"Now that's a convincing one."</p>
<p>Even in their natural state, the vertebrae of ground rats resembled a sword. Indeed, a creature that defied evolutionary odds to have a spine made by a single bone.</p>
<p>"This is for Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p>"Really? Can I take it?"</p>
<p>"Because you're our team's biggest power."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon was a monster who could beat two ground rats with a pipe, and then I gave her a ground rat knife?</p>
<p>It's only a matter of catching the bus from now on.</p>
<p>"Ah...... Thank you."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon accepted the knife as if she was embarrassed, and then examined the front and back of the knife for a long time.</p>
<p>"Suddenly I feel like I'm back in the Paleolithic age."</p>
<p>I stopped and looked up. I thought it sounded familiar, but then I realized it was a line from Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>I hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>「May I answer?」</p>
<p>I inhaled lightly, then spoke in a somewhat theatrical tone.</p>
<p>"You need to grind it a bit more for it to be useful. There are rocks around so skillfully grind the blade."</p>
<p>"Huh, understood, Captain."</p>
<p>Originally, this conversation had been between Kim Dokja and Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein, who came up behind them, scolded me with a whisper.</p>
<p>"Don't you think you're getting too close to Heewon-nim?"</p>
<p>"Well, someone has to look out for her. Until we meet Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>As I said that, my heart gradually grew heavy.</p>
<p>I wondered if I could do as much as Kim Dokja did.</p>
<p>Would I be able to help Jung Heewon survive in this world?</p>
<p>"By the way, there's a problem. Heewon-nim won't be able to grow as fast as things are going now."</p>
<p>As if reading my mind, Kyung Sein whispered.</p>
<p>"You remember that? Heewon-nim, gets stronger for real after her awakening as the 'Judge of Destruction'. At this rate, even if we meet the real Kim Dokja, Heewon-nim may not be as active as she was in the main novel."</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon's strongest skill is [Hour of Judgement].</p>
<p>In order to obtain it, she must become the 'Judge of Destruction'.</p>
<p>However, there are two prerequisites for her to do so.</p>
<p>One is that she is subjected to brutal violence by the Cheoldoo Group.</p>
<p>And two.</p>
<p>"In order for Heewon-nim to awaken as in the original, Cheon Inho-ssi must die."</p>
<p>My death.</p>
