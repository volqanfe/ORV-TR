<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">599 Episode 9. Words That Can't Be Said (5)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>Everything is white. An empty, blank space, like a manuscript page with nothing written on it.</p>
<p>My thoughts blinked like a cursor.</p>
<p>「"Inho-ssi, how did you become a writer?"」</p>
<p>Jung Heewon asked me that question when we were trapped inside the ichthyosaur.</p>
<p>Strangely, the answer didn't come to me immediately.</p>
<p>How did I become a writer?</p>
<p>The memory was distant and fuzzy.</p>
<p>「You're here?」</p>
<p>I forced my eyes open and saw a snowy sky.</p>
<p>I immediately realized where I was.</p>
<p>A snowfield covered in white.</p>
<p>As I slowly raised myself up, I saw the face of the protagonist I knew so well.</p>
<p>「Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja nodded. Just like the last time we met, he was still standing alone in the snowfield.</p>
<p>He waved lightly at me, then squatted down and stared at the ground. He was looking so intently at the ground that I couldn't help but approach and ask.</p>
<p>「Is there something there?」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja shook his head and smirked. His finger pointed down.</p>
<p>There was a pitch black footprint.</p>
<p>It wasn't the original footprint.</p>
<p>They were clearly recent.</p>
<p>I looked down at my feet, then back up at the print.</p>
<p>Then I slowly squatted down next to Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>「I wanted to be strong like you.」</p>
<p>I don't know why I said that, it just came out of my mouth.</p>
<p>「Like you.......」</p>
<p>「You know.」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja said.</p>
<p>「I'm not that strong.」</p>
<p>As he said this, he slowly turned around and saw the vague trail of footsteps behind him.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja, as if counting the footprints, said.</p>
<p>「I just kept walking.」</p>
<p>Keep walking.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja continued.</p>
<p>「It's going to be very hard from now on.」</p>
<p>「......」</p>
<p>「It will be lonely.」</p>
<p>After hearing those words, I felt really lonely. I said.</p>
<p>「This story won't have a happy ending.」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja didn't answer for a moment.</p>
<p>We looked at the footprints. Footprints that had disappeared. Footprints that were being made. And footprints that would be made.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja asked.</p>
<p>「Will you be alright?」</p>
<p>I nodded slowly.</p>
<p>「As long as you keep reading.」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja's eyes were on me. I felt awkward and averted his gaze.</p>
<p>He said.</p>
<p>「Well, it's not supposed to be like that.」</p>
<p>He hesitated, rummaged through his coat pockets, and placed something in my hand.</p>
<p>「Take it. And.......」</p>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
<p>I opened my eyes with a sight.</p>
<p>It was Chungmuro Station.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p>I put a hand on my forehead and raised my upper body. Kyung Sein's face came into view.</p>
<p>"Everyone......."</p>
<p>"It's okay, everyone's okay."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein squeezed my hand.</p>
<p>"Hey, Inho-ssi."</p>
<p>It was then that Dansoo ahjussi came to my side. He sat on his knees and stared at me.</p>
<p>His face looked like he was scolding me, or maybe he was worried.</p>
<p>But he didn't ask me anything, just hugged me quietly.</p>
<p>Then Kyung Sein next to us suddenly burst into tears and hugged us both.</p>
<p>In their arms, I looked out at the scenery of Chungmuro Station.</p>
<p>I could see the faces of the survivors.</p>
<p>Gong Pildu, Ye Hyunwoo and other people were building a fort at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>I could also see a large tarp over the entrance to the stairwell to prevent the poisonous gas from rising.</p>
<p>On the bench, injured people were tending to their wounds.</p>
<p>Some incarnations fell asleep after eating the [Elaine Forest Essence].</p>
<p>I could also see Jung Heewon lying on the ground and Lee Jihye sitting on the bench, staring at the tarp.</p>
<p>[There are 3 hours and 39 minutes remaining until the end of the 'Emergency Defense Battle'.]</p>
<p>[The 'Bureau' is currently considering an early end to the 'Emergency Defense Battle'.]</p>
<p>A faint cheer erupted from the people building the fort.</p>
<p>Early termination of the scenario.</p>
<p>It was an option the Bureau was considering.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' grumbles about how long he has to watch the obvious.]</p>
<p>[Some constellations are asking if the results are out already.]</p>
<p>The constellations were getting tired of the scenario, and it was clear that more time here wasn't going to change the outcome.</p>
<p>Even now, behind that tarp, monsters were dying in real time from the poisonous fog.</p>
<p>I stared at the thin membrane that separated the life and death of humans and monsters.</p>
<p>"Ah, Inho-ssi."</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo spotted me and waved at me. I hesitantly waved back.</p>
<p>"You."</p>
<p>A large shadow fell over my head. I looked up and saw a head glistening in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Gong Pildu frowned and ran his eyes down my arms and legs, each one scarred with the bite marks of ground rats.</p>
<p>"What were you going to do if you died?"</p>
<p>"I thought I wouldn't die."</p>
<p>Gong Pildu stared at my face for a long time, as if he didn't like my answer.</p>
<p>"Thanks to you, we all lived."</p>
<p>I swallowed hard.</p>
<p>It wasn't anyone else, it was Gong Pildu. The Ten Evil of Chungmuro Station. The second most proud person in the entire Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>He had just expressed his gratitude to me.</p>
<p>However, Gong Pildu's expression was a little strange.</p>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>Suddenly, I turned around and saw a ground rat's pup with its nose stuck in my side, calmly breathing.</p>
<p>Several people freaked out when they saw it.</p>
<p>No wonder.</p>
<p>They had just been in a fight for their lives with the ground rats, and now they were seeing a baby monster right in front of them.</p>
<p>Apparently frightened by their stares, the pup scurried into my arms.</p>
<p>Gong Pildu asked.</p>
<p>"Why did you bring it here?"</p>
<p>I put my hand on the frightened pup's head and thought.</p>
<p>I could have said I did it out of pity, or I could have said I felt guilty.</p>
<p>I could have plausibly argued that there was no one here today who fought because they wanted to fight, and that would have been the same for the monsters.</p>
<p>"Do you like dogs?"</p>
<p>Gong Pildu was silent for a moment.</p>
<p>As if reading our minds, the pup stuck its head out and looked at him.</p>
<p>Gong Pildu stared at the pup, then asked.</p>
<p>"Will you raise it?"</p>
<p>I hadn't thought about it.</p>
<p>I wondered if I could raise him.</p>
<p>Gong Pildu slowly bent down and squatted.</p>
<p>"Max."</p>
<p>Gong Pildu said in a scary voice. He spoke again, with a slight pause.</p>
<p>"Max."</p>
<p>Then with a whimper and a small cry, the ground rat pup hesitantly crawled out. After a moment's hesitation, it scooted closer to Gong Pildu, sniffed, and wagged its tail.</p>
<p>Gong Pildu's pupils shook faintly. In his wrinkled face, the faintest hint of longing came and went.</p>
<p>I asked.</p>
<p>"Have you ever had a dog?"</p>
<p>Instead of answering me, Gong Pildu stared at the tarp-covered stairwell for a moment.</p>
<p>"A dog would be perfect for guarding the land."</p>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
<p>After taking the ground rat pup away, Gong Pildu turned to the group and announced.</p>
<p>"We're going to raise this guy."</p>
<p>Max yawned loudly in Gong Pildu's hands.</p>
<p>"As you can see from the way those guys fought earlier, they're very tenacious and strong monsters. We're going to train him and use him as a guard dog. Anyone with a complaint, come out now."</p>
<p>One of the men, who had been glaring at the pup the whole time, held up a hand in frustration.</p>
<p>"What if it isn't well trained and attacks us?"</p>
<p>"In that case, I will be responsible for killing it."</p>
<p>Gong Pildu said firmly, and several men nodded. Some even hesitantly approached and took a closer look at Max.</p>
<p>"The pup is kind of cute in his own way."</p>
<p>"Huh, is that what he'll be like when he grows up?"</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi, who was watching the scene from the sidelines, said.</p>
<p>"When Jiyoon stayed in her room and read web novels."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I was in the living room watching old movies."</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi, who rarely talks about himself, brought up the topic for the first time in a long time.</p>
<p>"What kind of movies do you watch?"</p>
<p>"King Kong, Godzilla, King Kong vs. Godzilla......."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>The daughter read Omniscient Reader in her room, while the father watched King Kong vs. Godzilla in the living room. With a firmly closed door between them.</p>
<p>"When you watch a monster movie, there's always someone who takes pity on the monster and tries to raise it."</p>
<p>"......."</p>
<p>"Every once in a while, Jiyoong would walk by and say something like, 'There are no humans like that. How could people who were about to be eaten a moment ago want to raise the monster'?"</p>
<p>In the distance, Gong Pildu was teaching Max, a ground rat, how to 'give the paw'. Max looked up at him and licked his hand.</p>
<p>"I wish I could have shown her this view."</p>
<p>Gong Pildu frowned, and the people in Chungmuro Station smirked.</p>
<p>People were laughing, like actors backstage after a curtain call. As if everything that happened under that tarp was a lie.</p>
<p>Some people got hurt, some people got killed, but some people laughed.</p>
<p>They know that if they don't, they won't get to play the next scene.</p>
<p>"Mate."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"I don't want to watch a movie where my mate dies."</p>
<p>I stare at the people laughing and talking, unable to answer.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has sponsored you.]</p>
<p>[500 coins have been sponsored.]</p>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
<p>As a reward for risking my life, I was mentally attacked by Kyung Sein for a while.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi, you're just like Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"No, I mean, who in their right mind would suddenly jump into a mischief of ground rats in that situation? Aren't you actually Kim Dokja? Do you have the King of No Killing or something?"</p>
<p>That comment complicated my feelings quite a bit.</p>
<p>I mean, I like Kim Dokja, but this was kind of.......</p>
<p>—Hey.</p>
<p>There was a small spark in the air, and Bihyung's voice called out.</p>
<p>—Are you up?</p>
<p>Apparently, Bihyung was also waiting for me to wake up.</p>
<p>'Yes, I'm awake.'</p>
<p>Bihyung cleared his throat several times, then continued with a solemn voice.</p>
<p>—I'm really surprised this time. I didn't think you'd start a story.</p>
<p>At the same time as he spoke, the logs that had been pushed aside suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>[You have accomplished an achievement that never existed before.]</p>
<p>[You are beginning your first 'story' in the 3rd scenario.]</p>
<p>[A few constellations doubt your accomplishment.]</p>
<p>[Some constellations are interested in your achievement.]</p>
<p>[A very small number of constellations have noticed your existence.]</p>
<p>[10,000 coins have been sponsored.]</p>
<p>It's an achievement that made the nebulae pay attention to me.</p>
<p>Considering this is only the third scenario, that's quite an accomplishment.</p>
<p>—Don't get cocky. Oh, do you even know what a story is?</p>
<p>'I kind of know. If you collect them, you get stronger.'</p>
<p>—Well, it doesn't matter if you know that now....... Anyway, don't get carried away. You don't have a story yet, just the germination of the first one, okay?</p>
<p>'Yes.'</p>
<p>I couldn't help but smile bitterly, it was as if he was trying to calm down a writer who was excited about an unexpected box office hit.</p>
<p>In fact, as Bihyung said, I couldn't get cocky.</p>
<p>My first story was still a seed, and I wasn't sure if it would ever bloom. And even if it did, there was a chance it would be a bad one.</p>
<p>—You're the worst because you look obedient on the outside. Damn it.</p>
<p>As I listened to Bihyung's rambling, I remembered the beginning of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>The novice dokkaebi Bihyung was surprised and horrified by Kim Dokja's behavior.</p>
<p>—Anyway, there will be additional rewards after the scenario is completed, since no other incarnation has solved the 'Emergency Defense Battle' like you.</p>
<p>What kind of ending will this world's Bihyung have?</p>
<p>Will he become the Dokkaebi King of this world?</p>
<p>—Ha, by the way, this is really unusual. I can't believe there are already three people germinating stories.</p>
<p>I paused for a moment, then asked.</p>
<p>'There's other ones?'</p>
<p>Who is it? Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
<p>—Yes. They're pretty famous now. One dark person, one white person.......</p>
<p>The dark person is definitely Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>Who is the white one?</p>
<p>'Can you tell me who they are?'</p>
<p>—Naturally, I can't give you that kind of information, but I think they're a little crazy. They keep buying lemon candy from the 'dokkaebi bag'. It costs like 200 coins a piece.</p>
<p>'Lemon candy?'</p>
<p>—Anyway, I have to go. I've got a lot of other noisy places to be right now. Damn, I shouldn't have opened the Hidden Dungeon at a time like this.......</p>
<p>With those words, Bihyung disappeared.</p>
<p>I turned to Kyung Sein, who was still talking about Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>"Sein-ssi. Has Yoo Joonghyuk returned yet?"</p>
<p>"No, and you're still looking for Yoo Joonghyuk. Inho-ssi, you're really—"</p>
<p>"Sein-ssi."</p>
<p>"That bastard didn't even show his nose. Why?"</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, there's only one place Yoo Joonghyuk could have gone if he wasn't participating in the 'Emergency Defense Battle'.</p>
<p>「The Theater Dungeon.」</p>
<p>I had an ominous feeling.</p>
<p>Of course, Yoo Joonghyuk is strong in this world, so he won't die in the 'Theater Dungeon'.</p>
<p>At least, that's how it was supposed to be.</p>
<p>「Yoo Joonghyuk is stuck on the sunfish route again」</p>
<p>That comment from a few hours ago stuck with me.</p>
<p>I glanced at my surroundings and secretly opened my phone. The battery was almost dead.</p>
<p>[A new chapter has been updated!]</p>
<p>A new chapter already?</p>
<p>I absentmindedly scrolled through the list and stopped when I saw the new episode title.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>Episode 10. Writer (1)</p>
</fieldset>
<p>As soon as I saw the title, Bihyung's words ran through my head.</p>
<p>「They keep buying lemon candy from the 'dokkaebi bag'.」</p>
<p>I absentmindedly shoved my hand in my pocket.</p>
<p>Since when?</p>
<p>In my pocket, there was something I'd never put there before.</p>
<p>「Take it. And.......」</p>
<p>Too late, I remembered the words from my dream.</p>
<p>I took the object out of my pocket. Slowly, a chill ran down my spine.</p>
<p>A small candy wrapped in a yellow shell.</p>
<p>Surely, that's what Kim Dokja said.</p>
<p>「Give it to him.」</p>
<br/>
