<hr/>
<p>When I still didn't know much about web novels, I briefly attended a web novel academy because of Ji Eunyoo's recommendation.</p>
<p>The instructor was a writer who flavored a generation of genre literature.</p>
<p>He had a quiet, nervous voice and spoke very slowly, which is why I dozed off during the entire class.</p>
<p>However, one thing he said stuck with me.</p>
<p>"Don't hesitate to include chances, the more the merrier. Give them to the main character."</p>
<p>The instructor who used to live by those words disappeared from my life. I often imagined that maybe he transmigrated to the novel he wrote.</p>
<p>Just like me now.</p>
<p>"I-I-it's real! Inho-ssi! It's real!"</p>
<p>"It is."</p>
<p>Who would have thought that I would be the one to retrieve the chance.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein let out a scream of delight, shaking the box and turning it upside down several times.</p>
<p>"How did you know? It doesn't say anything about this in Omniscient Reader!"</p>
<p>To be honest, I was just as confused.</p>
<p>This box was an item in the 'preliminary manuscript' of chapter 23 of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>「An item described in the manuscript that was left out on draft 2.」</p>
<p>Anyway, the settings existed, so I looked it up just in case, and the item was indeed there.</p>
<p>Here's the question.</p>
<p>If this were setting for 'Ways of Survival', then of course Kim Dokja would have used this box in the original novel.</p>
<p>However, since Kim Dokja didn't use it, it means that this 'box' is not mentioned in the text of 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p>So since when has this setting been around?</p>
<p>From the moment I thought of it? From the moment Han Sooyoung handed me the manuscript?</p>
<p>The more I thought about it, the more my head spun.</p>
<p>Is this really the '41st round' of the Ways of Survival that I know?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>For now, we have the item, so let's just think about that.</p>
<p>I replied to Kyung Sein.</p>
<p>"It just occurred to me that this box was originally an item made by a dokkaebi and then discarded."</p>
<p>The box, which was dangerous enough to unbalance the scenario, was once an item in the Bureau designed by a mad dokkaebi.</p>
<p>"Uh...... that's right?"</p>
<p>"But did they really just dump that one item...... only one in the same place?"</p>
<p>"Wow, really. Wow."</p>
<p>After hearing my explanation, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi each grabbed their knifes and</p>
<p>started poking around the floor.</p>
<p>Of course, they wouldn't find another box.</p>
<p>There are only two of these boxes.</p>
<p>[Some constellations are shocked to discover the existence of the item.]</p>
<p>[A few constellations protest, asking when they released such an item.]</p>
<p>[A very small number of constellations start to point out the probability problem.]</p>
<p>A few constellations started to protest, but Bihyung doesn't seem to have gotten the memo.</p>
<p>I wondered what would happen if we closed the channel and ran away like in the original story, but I was glad.</p>
<p>I needed to see the reactions of the constellations.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is interested in your luck.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' asks if that box is real.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' widens its eyes in disbelief.]</p>
<p>In this world, there are countless 'readers', including me.</p>
<p>From what I've learned in the fight against the Misreading Association, readers are possessing not only incarnations, but also constellations.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow' taps its chin with its forefoot.]</p>
<p>I looked carefully at the indirect messages from the constellations.</p>
<p>If any of them were readers, they would surely unwittingly drop clues.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' piles up bricks.]</p>
<p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier tells you to enter the box.]</p>
<p>I observed each subsequent message, trying to figure out who they were.</p>
<p>One that looks like a normal constellation.</p>
<p>One that looks like it was possessed by a reader.</p>
<p>One I couldn't tell if it was a reader or a constellation.</p>
<p>One that is possessed by a reader, but remains true to the concept of a constellation.</p>
<p>One that is possessed by a reader that doesn't understand the concept of constellations.</p>
<p>Just plain weird and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all speculation on my part.</p>
<p>But hey, what can you really tell from one line of indirect messages?</p>
<p>They've all been reading Omniscient Reader so it shouldn't take much to convince for them to act like constellations.</p>
<p>By the way...... Where's Sneaking Schemer?</p>
<p>I was most curious about that guy's reaction.</p>
<p>"I guess that's the only box, I can't find anything else."</p>
<p>Apparently, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi were still digging.</p>
<p>"Ugh...... well, we have one. It's too bad we don't have a Broken Faith, because that's all we need for Unbroken Faith!"</p>
<p>As Kyung Sein said, we would only need that, but I couldn't get my hands on a Broken Faith right away.</p>
<p>So I made a decision.</p>
<p>"I've been thinking about it, and since we're at this point, why don't we try something different?"</p>
<p>"Something different?"</p>
<p>I pulled out an item I had just gotten from near the box.</p>
<fieldset>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">[Item information]</h3>
<p>Name: Unformed Idea</p>
<p>Rating: D</p>
<p>Description: A shapeless weapon of the past. It could have been anything, but ultimately became</p>
<p>nothing.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>An item that, at first glance, looks like spoiled jelly.</p>
<p>"If you don't mind, I was wondering if I could put this item in."</p>
<p>"This is...... Isn't this an item that didn't appear in Omniscient Reader?"</p>
<p>Right. It's probably not used in Ways of Survival either.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja wasn't particularly interested in this item either.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein glanced at the Unformed Idea and said.</p>
<p>"Well, we wouldn't have found the box if it weren't for you, Inho-ssi, so it's up to you."</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi nodded.</p>
<p>"I think so too."</p>
<p>"Wow, we're becoming a bit like 'Kim Dokja's Company', aren't we?"</p>
<p>"Haha, I guess so."</p>
<p>The two of them conceded so readily, I almost felt rather sorry.</p>
<p>"Thank you then."</p>
<p>Without further ado, I put 'Unformed Idea' into the 'random item box'.</p>
<p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier says it's a risky choice.]</p>
<p>I know it's a risky choice.</p>
<p>But there was a chance of failure no matter what I put in there in the first place.</p>
<p>"Now I need to get the starting material......."</p>
<p>"That's the core of a demon species, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>In order to use the box like in the original, we need to put the target item and the Demon Species Core together.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we failed to hunt the Dark Keeper, a 7th grade demon species.</p>
<p>For now, it's best to use the auction to get one...... but I don't know what kind of madman would risk a demon king curse to hunt a demonic species from the beginning.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' asks if you need a 'Demon Species Core'.]</p>
<p>We look up in surprise.</p>
<p>What was even more surprising was its next words.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' says that it can give you the 'Demon Species Core'.]</p>
<p>Kyung Sein, who was looking at the air with us, asked in a reminiscent voice.</p>
<p>"Rice Cake-Eating Tiger is the one from the traditional fairy tale, right? 'The Sun and the Moon'......."</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>Because that's the only fairy tale that comes to mind when I think of Korean 'Rice Cake-Eating Tigers'.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' says it's him.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' picks his nose and asks if he's a famous constellation.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' timidly replies that he is a bit famous on the Korean Peninsula.]</p>
<p>To get an item sponsored by a constellation from the beginning. Even Kim Dok-ja had never received such a sponsorship at this time.</p>
<p>If he's sponsoring items so early on, he has a reason to do so.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' says he has a favor to ask in exchange for the 'Demon Species Core'.]</p>
<p>As I said.</p>
<p>"I appreciate the offer, but......."</p>
<p>Normally, this kind of deal would be followed by a ridiculous request.</p>
<p>That's Kim Dokja's proverb.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' says he only needs you to attend one 'Twelve Zodiacs Ball' later.]</p>
<p>Twelve Zodiacs Ball?</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' says it's just a twelve zodiacs social event.]</p>
<p>This was another unexpected suggestion.</p>
<p>Twelve Zodiacs Ball.</p>
<p>It's probably the zodiacal version of the 'Constellation Banquet' or the 'Gourmet Association'.</p>
<p>As they listened to the message, Kyung Sein and ahjussi whispered.</p>
<p>"Wow, it's the &lt;Twelve Zodiacs&gt;......."</p>
<p>"They're the rat, cow, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, chicken, dog, and pig. Right?"</p>
<p>"That's...... right."</p>
<p>"When I was young, there was a cartoon movie with twelve zodiacs as the main characters......."</p>
<p>In the original version of the Omniscient Reader, the constellations of the nebula &lt;Twelve Zodiacs&gt; were the enemies of Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>But this time, the situation is a little different.</p>
<p>Is it because I'm a villain?</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' says there's no need to feel pressured.]</p>
<p>I've made my decision.</p>
<p>"I'll attend the Twelve Zodiacs Ball. Is that really all I have to do?"</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' says that's really it.]</p>
<p>"Okay, then."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' is greatly pleased.]</p>
<p>[A '7th grade Demon Species Core' has been sponsored.]</p>
<p>It was a very cool sponsorship.</p>
<p>A pitch black colored orb then appeared from thin air.</p>
<p>'7th grade Demon Species Core'.</p>
<p>It was even superior in color.</p>
<p>Tsuchuchuchut.</p>
<p>Judging from the faint sparks, it seemed that 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' had taken quite the probability.</p>
<p>What is he up to showing such sincerity to me when I'm not even his own incarnation?</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow' is sharing the probability of 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger'.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' is sharing the probability of 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger'.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself Into the Flames' is sharing the probability of 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger'.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' claps his hands at the animal brothers.]</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks to the animal friends, I have gathered all the ingredients.</p>
<p>Looking at the glowing core, Kyung Sein said excitedly.</p>
<p>"Oh, go ahead and put it in, Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p>"Why don't the three of us cover it at the same time?"</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>We covered the box.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein chanted.</p>
<p>"God! Buddha! Demon King of Salvation! Please!"</p>
<p>A moment later, a bright light emanated from the box.</p>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
<p>A place dozens of steps away from the core of the 'Edge of Darkness'.</p>
<p>In the center of the deep, black ether of the 'Dark Root', a woman in a white coat stood.</p>
<p>"Wow......."</p>
<p>She frowned at the 'random item box' glowing in the distance.</p>
<p>"Even the box was taken? From me? Is that even possible?"</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' asks why didn't you move faster.]</p>
<p>"Who's that guy?"</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' says he seems to be a reader from another world line.]</p>
<p>"A reader?"</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' says yes.]</p>
<p>The woman tilted her head at that, then smiled, baring her fangs.</p>
<p>"Not a guy?"</p>
<p>In her hand was a 'Broken Faith' that no reader in this world could have gotten.</p>
<br/>
