<hr/>
<p>When I first saw the 'collector' message, I had a feeling that it might be true.</p>
<p>But the head that appeared beyond the swirling portal was not an unfamiliar one.</p>
<p>[What number is this? You really want to ruin the company, don't you?]</p>
<p>A Dokkaebi with soft fur like a formless one. I had seen it at the 'Twelve Zodiac Ball'.</p>
<p>「Dokkaebi Yeonggi.」</p>
<p>The spirit giggled as it spun its head around in the air.</p>
<p>[Huh? Why aren't you answering? Are you thinking of not paying this time either?]</p>
<p>Looking at that Yeonggi, I thought of the setting of the main story.</p>
<p>This kind of collection work is usually given to low-level Dokkaebis or demoted Dokkaebis.</p>
<p>Even after 8 years, has he still not escaped being a low-level Dokkaebi?</p>
<p>Even his personality was clearly different from the 'Yeonggi' I knew. If the original Yeonggi was a 'rookie' who didn't understand what was being said but worked hard, the current Yeonggi seemed like a guy who had met the wrong shooter and only learned strange things.</p>
<p>[You're not going to pay? You're not going to pay? You're not going to pay? You're not going to pay? You know what happens if you don't pay?]</p>
<p>Yeonggi's neck started spinning around and the atmosphere started to change like a horror movie.</p>
<p>"Didn't I tell you to wait a little longer!"</p>
<p>The one who said those words was Namgung Myung, who had hurriedly opened the door and came in.</p>
<p>Namgung Myung looked around at Kyung Sein, me, and Yeonggi who were standing there awkwardly, then hurriedly lowered his head and added.</p>
<p>"I'm, I'm sorry, Benefactor. It's not the time for tax collection yet, so I didn't expect a tax collector to come by all of a sudden..."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein let out a light sigh and stepped forward to stop Namgung Myung.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, but I still need time to prepare."</p>
<p>[I think I heard that last time too—?]</p>
<p>"Just give me a little more time. You won't get coins that didn't exist if you keep urging me like that."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein's voice was quite calm as she answered. If it were the Kyung Sein I remember, she would have made a fuss and hidden behind me, and said, "Dokja-ssi, try to do something."</p>
<p>[Huh.]</p>
<p>The spinning Yeonggi's neck stopped.</p>
<p>[What are you so proud of? What's there to brag about not being able to pay taxes?]</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>[The deferrals up until now were close to special treatment. How strange. Why would the higher-ups be interested in such a small company? Anyway, that special treatment ends today. I can't wait any longer.]</p>
<p>"Even if you say that, it's difficult right now—"</p>
<p>[No. If it weren't for another incarnation, you would have a 'way to pay', right?]</p>
<p>Kyung Sein's face turned pale. Kyung Sein, who had been staring blankly into space, soon opened her mouth with a face of resignation.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>[Huh. Okay. Then shall we start collecting?]</p>
<p>I don't know exactly what 'collecting' Yeonggi meant, but judging from Kyung Sein's reaction, it didn't seem like a good thing.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute."</p>
<p>The moment a bright light appeared on Yeonggi's fingers, I stepped forward as if to protect Kyung Sein.</p>
<p>"I don't know what it is, but I will pay the tax instead."</p>
<p>[Huh? What is this?]</p>
<p>I was puzzled by Yeonggi's expression as he glared at me with a bad look.</p>
<p>[How long have you been there?]</p>
<p>He didn't recognize me?</p>
<p>That was odd.</p>
<p>A Dokkaebi from the Management Bureau, who is not even another being, didn't recognize me?</p>
<p>[You seem like an incarnation I've never seen before, so don't meddle in things that don't concern you and just stay quiet. If you don’t want to get screwed.]</p>
<p>Not only that, the guy didn’t seem to remember me.</p>
<p>I thought it was a good thing.</p>
<p>"If I’m someone related?"</p>
<p>[What do you mean?]</p>
<p>"It’s my company’s business, so there’s no way it wouldn’t be related."</p>
<p>At those words, Yeonggi’s head suddenly turned toward Kyung Sein.</p>
<p>[Is this incarnation a new employee?]</p>
<p>Just before Kyung Sein shook her head urgently, I interjected.</p>
<p>"I just got hired. So I have the obligation to take on the company’s debt as well."</p>
<p>[There’s no way… There’s an incarnation that gets hired at a company like this? You’re joking, right?]</p>
<p>"Dokkaebi Yeonggi, does that matter now? You’re just going to collect taxes anyway, right?"</p>
<p>When I mentioned the guy’s name, Yeonggi’s expression changed once again.</p>
<p>[Huh, does a mere incarnation know me?]</p>
<p>"Uh."</p>
<p>[No, it seems like you don’t know. If you really knew me, you wouldn't act like that...]</p>
<p>Namgung Myung took a step toward me, perhaps sensing that the situation was taking a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>I raised my hand to him as a sign that I was okay, and continued to speak.</p>
<p>"You seem to be the one who doesn't know much. Are they teaching the Dokkaebis at the Management Bureau to act like that these days?"</p>
<p>Yeonggi looked down at me with a blank expression for a moment, as if he didn't understand what I was saying, and then laughed in vain.</p>
<p>But I'm also dumbfounded.</p>
<p>[How dare a bug...]</p>
<p>He even brought out his 'bug' repertoire, as if he were a successor.</p>
<p>"Why, you'll make my head explode?"</p>
<p>[Do you think you can't?]</p>
<p>"Have you forgotten which scenario this is? Do you still think this is a tutorial?"</p>
<p>A faint anger began to form in Yeonggi's two eyes. The power of the Management Bureau was in the guy's eyes, shining faintly.</p>
<p>[You're very confident. If you think that killing a bug will cause trouble when there are no Constellations to see—]</p>
<p>"Why do you think there are no Constellations to see?"</p>
<p>[What?]</p>
<p>The next moment, I let out a blast. A loud noise shook the entire garden.</p>
<p>There it was.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein, who was startled, looked back at me, and Namgung Myung, whose face turned pale, slumped down. Of course, the most surprised one was Dokkaebi Yeonggi.</p>
<p>[This is ridiculous…]</p>
<p>Yeonggi, who was startled, trembled and asked me.</p>
<p>[Oh, were you by any chance a Constellation?]</p>
<p>In times like this, it's best to just laugh silently like Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>[What? Why can't I see the relevant information… And the modifier… What on earth are you?]</p>
<p>It's probably because of the [Fourth Wall] that he can't access my information.</p>
<p>Yeonggi must be perplexed. A mere incarnation has the status of a Constellation, and it must be a situation where he can't even look up modifiers. I decided to help him out a little.</p>
<p>"If you're really curious, open the 'Dokkaebi Bag'."</p>
<p>Yeonggi listened to me obediently.</p>
<p>And after a while.</p>
<p>[H-how on earth?]</p>
<p>'Dokkaebi Bag' has a system that assigns 'membership levels' by referencing the Constellation's item purchase history.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, the level of my former sponsor, 'Demon King of Salvation's' Dokkaebi Bag is...</p>
<p>[Diamond level...?]</p>
<p>Yeonggi's eyes widened and he looked back and forth between the screen in front of him and me, exuding shock.</p>
<p>As expected, it seemed that the 'Dokkaebi Bag' level of the 'Demon King of Salvation' had been transferred to me.</p>
<p>I guess I'm seeing the benefit of having a good sponsor here too.</p>
<p>[Demon King of Salvation? The owner of this modifier must have already disappeared? Why do you have the right to use it...]</p>
<p>"You don't need to know that. I think this is enough proof that I have the ability to pay."</p>
<p>Yeonggi groaned as if he didn’t want to admit it, then opened his mouth in a much more polite tone.</p>
<p>[Are you really going to pay your taxes in advance?]</p>
<p>"Yes. How many coins?"</p>
<p>Fortunately, I had quite a few coins.</p>
<p>However, the words that came out of Yeonggi’s mouth were somewhat unexpected.</p>
<p>[100,000 D coins.]</p>
<p>Namgung Myung, who was next to me, shouted in protest.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute! There can’t be that many! Last time, I’m sure…"</p>
<p>[You seem to have forgotten how much tax arrears there have been. All tax arrears accrue interest.]</p>
<p>"I know that, but…"</p>
<p>[The Management Office is not a poverty relief agency. And originally, you were supposed to pay 101,235 D coins, but since you, Diamond, specially agreed to pay in advance, I’ve reduced the rest.]</p>
<p>Yeonggi looked back at me and asked.</p>
<p>[Will you pay your tax arrears?]</p>
<p>"I don’t have any D coins. Can’t I just pay in coins?"</p>
<p>Then Yeonggi laughed.</p>
<p>[In this 'scenario area', only 'D Coins' are circulated.]</p>
<p>"Why don't you exchange the coins for D coins? What's the rate?"</p>
<p>Yeonggi's eyes started rolling at my words. Even at first glance, he had an expression that seemed to have an ulterior motive.</p>
<p>[If that's true, I'll exchange 10,000 coins for 1 D Coin.]</p>
<p>10,000 coins for 1 D Coin.</p>
<p>This kid must have learned how to catch people somewhere.</p>
<p>"Did we have coin inflation? The exchange rate can't be like that, right?"</p>
<p>[In principle, currency exchange is not allowed in this scenario area. This is also a suggestion I made because you are a Diamond member...]</p>
<p>No matter how much the coins rot, there's no way they would exchange them at that rate.</p>
<p>[Would you like to exchange them?]</p>
<p>"Would you?"</p>
<p>[Then let's just pretend that the tax payment never happened... ]</p>
<p>As if the results were visible, Yeonggi spoke with a shameless face.</p>
<p>I grinned.</p>
<p>Yeah, that’s how you come out.</p>
<p>"I’ll pay it. Before that, I have one question."</p>
<p>[Hmm? Go ahead.]</p>
<p>"What authority do you have to carry out this 'collection work'?"</p>
<p>Yeonggi tilted his head as if he didn’t understand what I was saying and asked back.</p>
<p>[What do you mean? I’m a Dokkaebi in charge of the collection mission, so of course I have the authority to collect, right?]</p>
<p>"That’s talking about other companies. It seems like the higher-ups didn’t specifically issue a collection order to this company?"</p>
<p>The guy clearly said it with his own mouth.</p>
<p>The higher-ups are giving Kyung Sein's company a 'deferral close to special treatment'.</p>
<p>That meant that someone in the management office was 'looking after this company' so that they could defer their taxes.</p>
<p>[That’s… ]</p>
<p>"I don't know where the guy who couldn't even properly explain the scenario learned such bad things and is acting like this..."</p>
<p>Yeonggi looked like he was hit with a sharp look. Looking at him, I somehow felt like I knew who the 'Dokkaebi who's looking after this company' was.</p>
<p>"Does Bihyung know that you're doing this here?"</p>
<p>At Bihyung's name, Yeonggi's face turned pale for a moment. I didn't miss the opportunity and continued to speak.</p>
<p>"It seems Bihyung doesn't know, does he?"</p>
<p>After hesitating for a moment, Yeonggi let out a faint sigh and answered.</p>
<p>[I don't know how you know that person, but even if you tell Bihyung, I can't give up on this collection.]</p>
<p>It was a stronger response than I thought.</p>
<p>Did he receive instructions from another high-level Dokkaebi other than Bihyung?</p>
<p>I thought for a moment and then said.</p>
<p>"Then give me a little more grace."</p>
<p>[How much...]</p>
<p>"A week."</p>
<p>[A week is too long.]</p>
<p>"Instead, I'll keep it a secret from him."</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>"I don’t know why the Management Bureau needs something like D-coins, but I can pay the taxes. I just want a little more time."</p>
<p>After thinking for a moment, Yeonggi answered.</p>
<p>[Okay. Since you seem to be close with Bihyoung, I will accept your offer. However, if you still can’t pay after a week, I will force the company’s executives to 'collect' the money.]</p>
<p>Yeonggi gave Kyung Sein a fierce look, then turned to me and said.</p>
<p>[I don’t know why someone like you is here, but I hope you have the grace of the story.]</p>
<p>With those words, Yeonggi disappeared beyond the swirling portal.</p>
<p>Namgung Myung looked at me with a somewhat impressed expression, and Kyung Sein looked at my toes with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi, you don’t have to go this far."</p>
<p>"I did it because I wanted to."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein’s eyes were red.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi… why?"</p>
<p>"Why? We're colleagues."</p>
<p>"Why, why did you come now…"</p>
<p>As she was saying that, Kyung Sein's breathing began to tremble.</p>
<p>"Why, why on earth did you come now… Are you making me expect…"</p>
<p>Kyung Sein, who had been muttering quietly, began to stumble.</p>
<p>"Sein-ssi?"</p>
<p>I hurriedly grabbed Kyung Sein, who was falling forward. Kyung Sein's entire body felt hot as if it were on fire.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi, you shouldn't get involved in this scenario."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute. Sein-ssi, the incarnation…"</p>
<p>I realized the moment my hand touched her. Kyung Sein's condition was so serious that I couldn't understand how she could have talked normally in such a body.</p>
<p>"If that happens, Inho-ssi too…"</p>
<p>With those words, Kyung Sein lost consciousness.</p>
<p>I felt Kyung Sein's pulse as she fell and checked the state of her hair.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein's hair was deeply damaged.</p>
<p>No, it wasn't just 'damage'.</p>
<p>It was like…</p>
<p>「A wound that felt like someone had ripped a part of her soul off.」</p>
<p>I laid Kyung Sein down neatly and held her hand.</p>
<p>Just by holding her hand, I could tell what kind of life she had been through. I felt like it was becoming clearer little by little what I had to do here.</p>
<p>I looked down at Kyung Sein who was sleeping and slowly opened my mouth.</p>
<p>"Gungmyung-ssi, how can I get something called D-coins?"</p>
