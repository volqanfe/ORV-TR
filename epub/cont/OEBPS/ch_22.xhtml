<hr/>
<p>In my dream, Kim Dokja called me Cheon Inho. However, when I listened carefully, it sounded like he was calling me Lee Hakhyun.</p>
<p>No, when I listened again.......</p>
<p>「■■■.」</p>
<p>I'm not sure what he was saying.</p>
<p>But there he was, and I was standing next to him.</p>
<p>We were looking at a very large snowfield.</p>
<p>A snowfield with letters floating on it.</p>
<p>It was so big, it seemed like no matter how much letters there was, they would never be able to cover it all.</p>
<p>「How long have you been here?」</p>
<p>I may or may not have asked that question.</p>
<p>「A very long time.」</p>
<p>I don't know if that's what Kim Dokja said or not.</p>
<p>As I stared at the snowfield for a while, I noticed something like footprints.</p>
<p>They were human footprints.</p>
<p>As if to test the waters, he gestured at me and started walking along the footprints.</p>
<p>I followed him too.</p>
<p>「This person must have really big feet.」</p>
<p>We walked, overlapping our footprints on top of each other. Occasionally, I'd take a wrong step and leave a footprint in the wrong place.</p>
<p>「Ah.」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja laughed, and I laughed, too.</p>
<p>「■■■ is going to get angry.」</p>
<p>I could almost hear him saying that.</p>
<p>And I wonder how long we walked.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but the big footprints split into two directions. One big footprint kept moving forward, and the other big footprint started walking diagonally.</p>
<p>So were there two the persons leaving big footprints from the beginning?</p>
<p>I couldn't be sure.</p>
<p>They were all the same size.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why, but here the owners of the big footprints suddenly became two. So one walked straight ahead and the other walked diagonally.</p>
<p>I stared at the path of the footprints in front of me, and then tried to follow them for a few steps.</p>
<p>I must have taken a dozen steps.</p>
<p>「It stopped.」</p>
<p>The footprints stopped here.</p>
<p>Where had the owner of these footprints gone?</p>
<p>A strange thought occurred to me as I stared at the footprints.</p>
<p>Perhaps the owner of the footprints was still standing on them.</p>
<p>When I turned around, Kim Dokja was standing tall and looking in my direction.</p>
<p>I waved at him and asked.</p>
<p>「Can I keep walking this way?」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja nodded.</p>
<p>I asked again.</p>
<p>「I might make a mistake like I did before.」</p>
<p>「It's okay.」</p>
<p>「I might make a mess of the snowfield.」</p>
<p>「It doesn't matter.」</p>
<p>Is it really okay?</p>
<p>I wanted to ask again, and again, and again.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja smiled and said something. Unfortunately, I couldn't hear his last words.</p>
<p>「I'll keep watching you.」</p>
<p>It sounded like that.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Inho-ssi! Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p>My whole body ached: the wound in my side throbbed and the pain in my broken left arm was excruciating.</p>
<p>"You said you weren't going to sleep! It's already started!"</p>
<p>"Uh, sorry."</p>
<p>I must have fallen asleep. I wondered why I had such a fairy tale-like dream,</p>
<p>"Pinocchio wasn't good during the operation either."</p>
<p>I guess it was because I heard about Pinocchio. Kim Dokja's last words still echoed in my head.</p>
<p>When I looked around, the stomach was already pumping out digestive juices.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon was spraying 'Mucus of the Hammer Seahorse' all over my head. My shoulders slumped as the sticky liquid trickled down.</p>
<p>"Stay still, you said it's safe to apply this."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon smeared her own body with the Mucus of the Hammer Seahorse.</p>
<p>Our plan was simple.</p>
<p>One, smear our entire bodies with mucus to resist the ichthyosaur's digestive juices.</p>
<p>Two, when the digestive juices start spewing, stick a 'Stone Hog's Pointed Thorn' into the openings.</p>
<p>This is the exact same tactic that Kim Dokja did in the original novel.</p>
<p>The difference is.......</p>
<p>"By the way, who's Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"You mentioned him in your sleep."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>I thought for a moment, then opened my mouth.</p>
<p>"It's just a friend's name."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon asked, squeezing my mucus-covered head.</p>
<p>"Then what about Ji Eunyoo?"</p>
<p>"Did I say that name too?"</p>
<p>"Yes. You asked me to save you."</p>
<p>Did I have a deadline in my dreams?</p>
<p>"It's the name of my editor."</p>
<p>"Your editor?"</p>
<p>I thought it would be okay to be a little honest. I didn't know what Cheon Inho's real job was anyway. He was probably a swindler or something.</p>
<p>"I used to be a writer."</p>
<p>Still, it's better to be a writer than a swindler.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"Wow, a writer? What kind of books did you write?"</p>
<p>"That...... Do you know web novels?"</p>
<p>"Web novels? Is it like a webtoon?"</p>
<p>"That...... like Lord of the Rings......."</p>
<p>"Oh, Lord of the Rings! I've seen the movies! Is that what you wrote?"</p>
<p>"Well, something similar......."</p>
<p>I don't know why my voice kept getting lower.</p>
<p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is asking you to speak up.]</p>
<p>Easier said than done.</p>
<p>I sighed lightly and said.</p>
<p>"Would you mind not telling the others?"</p>
<p>"Why? I think it's cool."</p>
<p>This is why you shouldn't introduce yourself.</p>
<p>"Let's start with that side first. Hold this and insert one on each opening."</p>
<p>"Maybe because you're a writer you're good at changing the subject."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon grumbled, but stuck the thorns where I pointed.</p>
<p>As expected, the physicality of a main character was truly something else.</p>
<p>There were four openings.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon stuck one thorn into each of the three openings, then closed them tightly to keep the digestive juices from flowing out.</p>
<p>"There's only one left."</p>
<p>"Let's shove the rest of them into this one opening."</p>
<p>"Is that okay?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It'll probably work better."</p>
<p>The 'Stone Hog's Pointed Thorn' is an item that grows by sucking the fluids of sea species.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja had only used one thorn for each opening.</p>
<p>But in theory, the more thorns you put in an opening, the better.</p>
<p>The more thorns there are, the more thorns will grow at the same time, and the faster the ichthyosaur will fall.</p>
<p>"One."</p>
<p>Digestive juices gurgled out of the thorn.</p>
<p>The second thorn was inserted, and the ichthyosaur's stomach began to wriggle grotesquely.</p>
<p>It wasn't so easy from the third thorn on. Jung Heewon frowned as she stuck the thorn into the hole again and again.</p>
<p>"After the third one, it's a bit difficult, can you...... support me from the back?"</p>
<p>"I'd love to, but my arms are like this."</p>
<p>"Support me with your back. Like this."</p>
<p>I stood with my back against Jung Heewon's back. Inhaling and exhaling, she pushed the thorn with all her might into the opening.</p>
<p>The part we were standing on shook for a moment, but the thorn went in just right.</p>
<p>After taking a breath, Jung Heewon asked.</p>
<p>"Are we done?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Now we just have to wait."</p>
<p>"It's really simple."</p>
<p>The job was done faster than I thought. In the main novel, Kim Dokja even practiced stabbing to get this done...... Why did he struggle so much anyway?</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' admires your composure.]</p>
<p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier says it's easy because it's a 'sea serpent'.]</p>
<p>According to my calculations, the time it'll take to subdue the ichthyosaur is half a day to a day.</p>
<p>Considering the number of thorns it has, and the fact that it's smaller than the original, it could go down sooner than that.</p>
<p>Now it was just a matter of waiting.</p>
<p>I felt a sudden chill rush through me as I relaxed, probably because I was soaking wet from the river.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon looked at me wistfully as I shivered, then made an unexpected suggestion.</p>
<p>"Shall we stand back to back?"</p>
<p>"If you don't mind, may we?"</p>
<p>"Please sit that way."</p>
<p>We meekly sat back to back. The warmth of Jung Heewon's body transmitted through my back, and I felt a little less cold.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon asked.</p>
<p>"By the way, how did you come up with this method?"</p>
<p>"It's just something that often appears in web novels."</p>
<p>"You're a writer, I see."</p>
<p>As my back warmed up, I slowly dozed off.</p>
<p>I wish I could use the 'Elaine Forest Essence' sold in the Dokkaebi Bag, but I couldn't right now.</p>
<p>The Elaine Forest Essence recovers your body's wounds completely while you sleep.</p>
<p>I couldn't leave her alone without knowing what would happen.</p>
<p>She kept talking to me as if she knew my condition.</p>
<p>"Tell me something funny."</p>
<p>This was the most embarrassing moment of my life as a writer.</p>
<p>In fact, writers are not very funny people. None of the writers I know are funny.</p>
<p>Still, I managed to squeeze out some dry humor.</p>
<p>"In my novel, there's a character named Jung Heewon."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"She looks really strong on the outside, but she's actually a fragile person. She doesn't shy away from fights because she's a very hard person, so she often breaks."</p>
<p>I thought of the 'Jung Heewon' I knew.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I had a question.</p>
<p>Can I really say that the Jung Heewon I know is the Jung Heewon behind my back now?</p>
<p>I continued.</p>
<p>"She's good at physical work and have a quick mind. When she was in high school, she was confessed to by junior girls."</p>
<p>"......."</p>
<p>"She's bad at bearing public criticism, but she's good at kendo. She's been going to a kendo academy since she was a kid."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, who had been listening until here, clapped her hands. She was genuinely impressed.</p>
<p>"That's great, you almost got it all right."</p>
<p>Of course I did. Most of it comes from the main novel.</p>
<p>"But the last one is wrong, I never went to a kendo academy, I just went to kendo club at school."</p>
<p>I know. I said that on purpose.</p>
<p>"That's a shame."</p>
<p>"I went to the nationals, and I was elected district representative, but I quit."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because of an injury."</p>
<p>This was a story I didn't know.</p>
<p>More accurately, it was a story I hadn't written.</p>
<p>"Injury? Were you hurt badly?"</p>
<p>Jung Heewon was silent for a moment, and then, a beat too late, she answered.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>It hit me like a ton of bricks. There must be a story in this world that I didn't write.</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered that Jung Heewon's attribute was 'Crouching Figure'.</p>
<p>How did she become a 'Crouching Figure'?</p>
<p>Originally, 'Crouching Figure' is an attribute that is generated based on the strong mental shock of an incarnation.</p>
<p>However, Jung Heewon was already a 'Crouching Figure' before she met the Cheoldoo Group.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi, how did you become a writer?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I..."</p>
<p>I naturally opened my mouth to speak, but I shut up again. An eerie sensation flickered across my chest.</p>
<p>「How did I become a writer?」</p>
<p>I suddenly couldn't remember.</p>
<p>It was then that the ichthyosaur's stomach wriggled ominously.</p>
<p>I quickly kept my balance and said.</p>
<p>"I think it's about to start."</p>
<p>There was no time for distractions now.</p>
<p>The fight was about to begin.</p>
<p>The ichthyosaur would go down first, or we would go down first?</p>
<p>I took off the shirt I was wearing and used both sleeves to tie Jung Heewon's and my wrists together.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to get cold? Ugh!"</p>
<p>The floor vibrated sharply.</p>
<p>The ichthyosaur was twisting its body in pain. The thorns had begun to dig into its body in earnest.</p>
