<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">578 Episode 5. Villain (3)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>After realizing that this world was the '41st round' of Ways of Survival, Kyung Sein slowly dropped to the ground and began to do planks.</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi was speechless for a while, as if he hadn't realized what was happening yet.</p>
<p>I didn't stop them and waited for a while.</p>
<p>I could hear Kyung Sein counting.</p>
<p>"Nine, ten, eleven......."</p>
<p>In the distance, I saw Bang Cheolsoo talking to Dayoung's mother.</p>
<p>"Cheolsoo-ssi, how come you're so fearless and brave?"</p>
<p>"Haha, the life I've lived is a little different than most people."</p>
<p>Suddenly, I wanted to slap Bang Cheolsoo on the back of the head.</p>
<p>"Thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty...... Inho-ssi."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What do we do now?"</p>
<p>Apparently, no amount of planking could give him an answer, because he collapsed to the floor.</p>
<p>I helped him to his feet.</p>
<p>"It's okay, there's Dansoo ahjussi and Sein-ssi. And Sein-ssi said you've read Omniscient Reader's Encyclopedia or something like that ten times."</p>
<p>"What's the point of reading that? This is not Omniscient Reader, it's Ways of Survival. The 41st round is barely mentioned in the novel. The only thing that is mentioned is......."</p>
<p>I know. It's all about how bad Yoo Joonghyuk was.</p>
<p>Just because this world is the 41st round, some of the methods Kim Dokja used are now obsolete.</p>
<p>"Still, we can't give up yet. It's still early in the scenario."</p>
<p>"But it's the 41st round! Yoo Joonghyuk is a scumbag!"</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi, who finally realized the seriousness of the situation, muttered his daughter's name.</p>
<p>Suddenly, memories of the days when I was writing my manuscript came back to me.</p>
<p>When I was writing the 'Disaster of Floods' episode, in which the Shin Yooseung from the 41st round was a disaster, I received a letter from a reader at the management office.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk can't be such a bad guy. Honestly, 41st round Yoo Joonghyuk is a plot hole, please fix it immediately.</p>
<p>It was a letter that said something like that.</p>
<p>At the time, I thought, 'Who are you, asshole?' But now that I think about it, the reader was right.</p>
<p>I should have just fixed it then.</p>
<p>"He'll become trashier and trashier, but maybe he's not irredeemable yet. Even in Omniscient Reader, Yoo Joonghyuk was a psychopath at first. He changed later on, so maybe there's a chance for him here."</p>
<p>You can't rewrite people, but you can rewrite characters.</p>
<p>It's funny that I'm defending a guy who tried to kill me, but I'm not going to lose hope yet.</p>
<p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is looking at you.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' says they're not sure what you are talking about, but the man in the black coat looks like a bad guy.]</p>
<p>As long as you carry out the scenarios, you will continue to run into Yoo Joonghyuk. You can't just keep avoiding him every time.</p>
<p>After all, you'll need his help to clear the final chapter.</p>
<p>Especially if this is 'Ways of Survival' instead of 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<p>"If possible, I'll be the one to contact Yoo Joonghyuk from now on. You should avoid him no matter what."</p>
<p>"Will you be alright?"</p>
<p>"After all, he gave me the 'Elaine Forest Essence'."</p>
<p>"Isn't that just to take advantage of Inho-ssi?"</p>
<p>"That's what I think, too, so that's good, because he won't kill me right away if I'm worth using."</p>
<p>I'm sure he'd left something like that because he still has expectations for me.</p>
<p>Besides, I didn't tell them, but there were still secrets in this '41st round' that I didn't know about.</p>
<p>For example, there's some kind of deal between Cheon Inho and Yoo Joonghyuk from the previous round.</p>
<p>There's no need to think about it right now. We'll just have to find out slowly from now on.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' picks his nose and asks how long the filter will be up.]</p>
<p>Please be patient with us, constellations-nim.</p>
<p>We're talking about something important.</p>
<p>"Don't be discouraged, just do what you can. Our pace isn't bad either. Heewon-ssi has awakened, Dansoo ahjussi knows how to tame bugs, Sein-ssi has [Average Correction], and Sein-ssi, you're putting all your coins on physique, right?</p>
<p>"Yes. Of course, but......."</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>As expected from the soul of a muscular man.</p>
<p>If Kyung Sein could play the tanker role, the party now had a basic formation of damage dealer-support-tanker.</p>
<p>So what's my position?</p>
<p>"I've got Cheon Inho who can carry the eloquence role, so we're not that far behind &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt;."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein laughed weakly at my joke.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Dansoo ahjussi, who was already in high spirits, nodded his head.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi is right."</p>
<p>"You recovered quickly."</p>
<p>"This is nothing."</p>
<p>"You're not from a different world than ours, are you?"</p>
<p>"Jiyoon will be disappointed if I get frustrated over this."</p>
<p>Perhaps the most frustrated person here is Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p>He's not even a devoted reader of Omniscient Reader, he's just a guy who ended up possessing someone in the novel because of his daughter.......</p>
<p>I became a little curious about what kind of life Dansoo ahjussi had that led him possess someone here.</p>
<p>"Let's go get the hidden piece first. We were lucky enough to start at Geumho Station, so we have an advantage over everyone else."</p>
<p>"Ah! Do you mean, to get 'that'.......?"</p>
<p>"Yep. Let's go get it."</p>
<p>At Geumho Station, there is a representative hidden piece that Kim Dokja gets.</p>
<p>The star relic, 'Unbroken Faith'.</p>
<p>In order to get it, you must go to the 'Edge of Darkness' of Geumho Station and enter the 'Ground Rat's Treasure Trove'.</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi's expression was dark.</p>
<p>"If that's the case, we'd better hurry."</p>
<p>"Oh, right. Actually......."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein said as she jumped to her feet.</p>
<p>"There are people who have already set out that way."</p>
<p>No, you should have told me that first, guys.</p>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
<p>We quickly finished our preparations and stood in the tunnel leading to the Yaksu Station.</p>
<p>I thought about waiting for Jung Heewon to wake up, but I was impatient that there were people who had already left ahead of us.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about Heewon-ssi and go."</p>
<p>When Dayoung's mother opened her mouth as if to leave it to her, Bang Cheolsoo thumped his chest and spoke up.</p>
<p>"I'll protect Geumho Station!"</p>
<p>Dayoung'mother nodded reliably and looked at Bang Cheolsoo.</p>
<p>I stared at the two figures for a moment, a weird atmosphere beginning to form. Something has definitely changed, but I don't know if it's for the better.</p>
<p>"Let's go."</p>
<p>We stepped into the tunnel, and in an instant, the voices grew quieter, followed by another deep darkness.</p>
<p>This time, it was Kyung Sein who spoke up first.</p>
<p>"It's not fair to wake up Heewon-nim and come back again, is it?"</p>
<p>"You said you fed her Elaine Forest Essence, so she won't wake up even if you try."</p>
<p>"But we don't even have a DPS¹ now...... Isn't it dangerous?"</p>
<a href="#note1" epub:type="noteref">[NOTE 1]</a><p>"We don't have much time left. If they passed through here twenty minutes ago, they might have already entered the 'Edge of Darkness'."</p>
<p>Honestly, I didn't expect anyone to go first. Kim Dokja in the original novel was still in the middle of his hidden scenario.</p>
<p>"How many people went first?"</p>
<p>"Two, a man and a woman. They came down from upstairs all of a sudden......."</p>
<p>"Were they readers?"</p>
<p>Actually, this was a question to get her thinking.</p>
<p>She answered immediately.</p>
<p>"I don't know, but I guess so, because the timing doesn't allow for any characters to pass by here. I didn't get a good look at them because they were going too fast on their bikes, but......."</p>
<p>A bike? This early on?</p>
<p>"But Inho-ssi, you do know that there's a boss monster at the 'Edge of Darkness', right?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I know."</p>
<p>For reference, there is an initial boss monster in the 'Edge of Darkness', the 'Dark Keeper'.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was a way to deal with it in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein asked, her eyes shining with anticipation.</p>
<p>"Did you happen to buy [Purest Sword Force] or the 'Broken Faith'?"</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>[Purest Sword Force] was sold out, and from what I could know through Bihyung there were no sellers for Broken Faith, only a long waiting list.</p>
<p>-Why is everyone getting that crappy item? Is there some kind of patch I don't know about?</p>
<p>Kyung Sein's expression darkened.</p>
<p>"Then we won't be able to catch the 'Dark Keeper'? Even in the original, Kim Dokja barely beat it with the combo of [Purest Sword Force] and 'Broken Faith'."</p>
<p>"I'll think about it as we go."</p>
<p>"If you don't have 'Broken Faith', you can't make 'Unbroken Faith'......."</p>
<p>"First of all, we should get the random item box."</p>
<p>There is a 'random item box' in the Ground Rat's Treasure Trove, which is guarded by the 'Dark Keeper', that allows you to 'upgrade items' in the first use.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja used the box to upgrade his 'Broken Faith' to 'Unbroken Faith'.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein shook her head.</p>
<p>"Well, you can get 'Broken Faith' later. Do you remember all the boss patterns?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>The problem is the physique to perform the pattern.</p>
<p>I opened the rewards messages I'd been putting off.</p>
<p>[There are currently 3 unclaimed rewards.]</p>
<p>I hit the collect button one by one.</p>
<p>[You have claimed the reward for the hidden scenario 'Serpent Slayer'].</p>
<p>[The scenario was cleared early due to the intervention of other sea species.]</p>
<p>[You have received part of the scenario's reward.]</p>
<p>[2,000 coins have been earned.]</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I only received half of the reward because the final hit was stolen by the Sea Commander. The next reward, however, was more than enough to make up for the disappointment.</p>
<p>[The incarnation you awakened, 'Jung Heewon', hunted the 'Sea Commander'.]</p>
<p>[The incarnation 'Jung Heewon' succeeded in looting the rewards of the hidden scenario—'Commander Slayer' that someone was performing.]</p>
<p>[A portion of the looted reward is attributed to you.]</p>
<p>[4,000 coins have been earned.]</p>
<p>[2,000 additional coins have been earned for your first looting reward.]</p>
<p>Looting rewards?</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Does it mean there was an incarnation hunting the 'Sea Commander'?</p>
<p>My head was spinning.</p>
<p>According to the main story of Omniscient Reader, it was Kim Dokja who hunted down the 'Sea Commander' and earned the reward.</p>
<p>Since there will most likely not be a Kim Dokja in this round, it must be a regular reader who read Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>What happened to that reader?</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' chuckles.]</p>
<p>I feel sorry for that reader, but 6,000 coins for the looting was a great harvest anyway.</p>
<p>And that wasn't the only reward.</p>
<p>[You have claimed the constellations' sponsorship rewards.]</p>
<p>[6,800 coins have been sponsored.]</p>
<p>Jung Heewon's awakening scene was quite popular on the &lt;Star Stream&gt;, and we received a significant amount of sponsorships for such an early stage.</p>
<p>Prisoner of the Golden Headband, Abyssal Black Flame Dragon, and the nice animal constellations donated coins.</p>
<p>[14,800 coins have been earned in total.]</p>
<p>[Coins Possessed: 17,100 C]</p>
<p>I'm rich now.</p>
<p>If I were Kim Dokja, I'd be saving this like it was my last dollar.</p>
<p>But I'm different.</p>
