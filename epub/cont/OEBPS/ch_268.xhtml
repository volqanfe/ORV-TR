<hr/>
<p>Her eyes widened as she found me sitting in the seat.</p>
<p>"You."</p>
<p>Her blond hair swayed in the wind. Her eyes shook as if she was agitated.</p>
<p>I waved my hand lightly at her and smiled.</p>
<p>"It's been a while."</p>
<p>I never thought we would meet in a place like this.</p>
<p>Her expression hardened at my greeting, and she hesitated for a moment before approaching me briskly.</p>
<p>"Cheon Inho."</p>
<p>The person who called me 'Cheon Inho'.</p>
<p>"Why are you here?"</p>
<p>Prophet Anna Croft.</p>
<p>She was in the same 'Fear' as me.</p>
<hr/>
<p>As I live, there will come a day when I ride the same subway as Anna Croft.</p>
<p>I thought about my last encounter with her. The last time I saw her was at the 'Washington Dome'.</p>
<p>At that time, I fell into 'Gingagap', a trap set by &lt;Asgard&gt;, and there, I borrowed the power of the Demon King of Salvation and defeated the great Constellations. Come to think of it, I owed Anna Croft that time. If she hadn’t processed the 'Lesser Dragon's Heart' with her own trait, neither I nor the Demon King of Salvation would have been able to summon the power of 'Cheok Jungyeong' as a [bookmark].</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, Cheok Jungyeong is here too. I don’t know if it was a coincidence or not, but things were going quite strangely.</p>
<p>I pointed to the seat next to me and said to Anna Croft.</p>
<p>"Please sit down."</p>
<p>Anna Croft hesitated for a moment, as if she was uncomfortable sitting next to me, and then sat down with a helpless expression.</p>
<p>"What are you planning here?"</p>
<p>"I’m not planning anything in particular."</p>
<p>"What are you planning—"</p>
<p>The moment we got to that point in the conversation, I felt the gaze I had felt the other time.</p>
<p>「On the sub way」</p>
<p>Oh, again.</p>
<p>「You’re tal king too loud ly」</p>
<p>My stomach started to churn and I felt faint dizziness.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is activated.]</p>
<p>Fortunately, I had already experienced it once, and the [Fourth Wall] was also activated, so I could endure it.</p>
<p>But it seemed that Anna Croft was not like that.</p>
<p>"W-what is this?"</p>
<p>Anna Croft, whose face had turned pale, was already sweating profusely.</p>
<p>Even she, who had a fairly high level of mental barrier, could end up like that.</p>
<p>"Lower your voice."</p>
<p>As I whispered, the gazes aRound her disappeared as if they had been washed away.</p>
<p>Anna Croft, panting and wiping away her sweat, asked.</p>
<p>"What was that just now?"</p>
<p>"Probably a Fear effect."</p>
<p>The subway we were riding in had not yet experienced the 'Crime Zone'.</p>
<p>Judging from the fact that a similar phenomenon occurred when I called and when I spoke to Anna Croft—this place seemed to be a space dominated by the common 'Spirit-Bound Combat Technique' of public transportation.</p>
<p>It could be something like this. Do not talk loudly or make noise. Do not eat food.</p>
<p>Do not make noise.</p>
<p>Give up your seat to pregnant women or the elderly.</p>
<p>Anna Croft also seemed to have noticed the rules.</p>
<p>"A peculiar rule is in effect."</p>
<p>"It's an ordinary rule. This was normal before the scenarios came."</p>
<p>We sat side by side and admired the everyday scenery that we had forgotten. The soft breathing of people. People looking down and concentrating on the small screen.</p>
<p>It felt real again. This was the ordinary world we knew. People in those days were trapped in their own worlds, and perhaps the scenario pulled them out of there.</p>
<p>'Scenarios' that Kim Dokja had read.</p>
<p>I glanced over and saw that Anna Croft was also lost in a short reflection.</p>
<p>She must have sensed my gaze, but she came to her senses and said in a cold voice.</p>
<p>"I knew you were alive, but you're much better than I thought."</p>
<p>Anna Croft seemed to have already heard the news about me.</p>
<p>"You're glad I'm okay, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"No one can go through something like that and be fine."</p>
<p>"Have you heard any rumors?"</p>
<p>"I heard that you were chased by giant nebulae and torn apart."</p>
<p>Torn apart.</p>
<p>That's not wrong.</p>
<p>I was not the one who was 'torn apart' to begin with.</p>
<p>"Wow, it almost turned out like that."</p>
<p>"You're so tenacious that you survived that kind of defeat."</p>
<p>"Because I'm good at coming back from the dead. But why did you come here?"</p>
<p>"Are you really asking because you don't know?"</p>
<p>A thought occurred to me belatedly.</p>
<p>The last time I saw Anna Croft, she went against her own Nebula, &lt;Asgard&gt;, to help me.</p>
<p>I knew what the incarnation that went against the nebulae would say.</p>
<p>"You seem to be blooming too."</p>
<p>"Thanks to who? I was going to ask you about it at the Recycling Center anyway..."</p>
<p>"Um, I didn't see you there?"</p>
<p>"I didn't know you were a crazy person who wanted to clear it all the way."</p>
<p>"Did you come all the way to the Fear Realm to chase me?"</p>
<p>"Look here. Do I look like someone who's free?"</p>
<p>"Then why did you come to the Fear Realm?"</p>
<p>"I'm not the incarnation of &lt;Asgard&gt; anymore. What choice would an abandoned incarnation have?"</p>
<p>"Aha, you're thinking of becoming a Transcendent."</p>
<p>The only path left for her abandoned by &lt;Asgard&gt;.</p>
<p>Anna Croft had come here to climb the only ladder of social mobility that a mortal abandoned by the Constellations could attempt.</p>
<p>"I think that's also a failure since I came all the way here to meet you."</p>
<p>"Come on, let's forget about the old days and get along. That's how we'll get out of here. We'll go out and become Transcendents, and take revenge on the Constellations . Anyway, let's go on good terms."</p>
<p>Anna Croft muttered as if she was shocked at what I said.</p>
<p>"On good terms? Do you think that's possible between you and me?"</p>
<p>"I've become a colleague with Yoo Joonghyuk. I'll embrace you with a big heart."</p>
<p>"Who's talking to whom right now—"</p>
<p>Anna Croft, who was about to shout, suddenly stopped talking. The passengers' eyes were turned towards her.</p>
<p>Anna Croft asked again, sighing as if she was going to collapse.</p>
<p>"Cheon Inho. Do you know anything about this 'Fear'?"</p>
<p>I nodded and briefly relayed the information I knew.</p>
<p>Anna Croft nodded after hearing my story.</p>
<p>"I expected it since the backgRound was the subway. Then I guess we'll have to create a Crime Zone to get out of here."</p>
<p>"I'm against it."</p>
<p>"Against it?"</p>
<p>"We have to find a way to get out without activating the Crime Zone."</p>
<p>"Didn't you say that the method is unknown? With your abilities, you could easily be the last one standing even if you use the 'Crime Zone'."</p>
<p>"You were on board with me, of all people."</p>
<p>Anna Croft looked momentarily flustered.</p>
<p>"Because of me?"</p>
<p>"The Cheon Inho of this world line is quite affectionate."</p>
<p>"You always said that and aimed for my back."</p>
<p>"Cheok Jungyeong is riding in the next car."</p>
<p>"Cheok… Jungyeong?"</p>
<p>"Do you know the Goryeo Swordsman?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no way—"</p>
<p>Only then did Anna Croft's face turn pale as if she realized the situation.</p>
<p>"We're dead."</p>
<p>"That's why I need your ability now."</p>
<p>Come to think of it, it was my good fortune to meet Anna Croft now. Anna Croft was the incarnation with the ability specialized in this 'Fear Realm'.</p>
<p>"Can you see something in [Future Sight]?"</p>
<p>Anna Croft can read the future with [Future Sight]. This means that if she uses her ability well, she can also power up the threatening Fear that will come in the future.</p>
<p>But Anna Croft's expression was unusual.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"My [Future Sight] lost its power after coming here."</p>
<p>Anna Croft glared at me for a moment as if she didn't want to admit it, then added,</p>
<p>"It's as if the entire future is covered in fog."</p>
<p>This was unexpected.</p>
<p>She can't see the future. Why?</p>
<p>Looking back, there were several times in the main story when 'Anna Croft's' prophetic ability was blocked.</p>
<p>Why was that?</p>
<p>Oh... Wait a minute. Could it be?</p>
<p>A hypothesis suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p>To verify that hypothesis, I reviewed Han Sooyoung's guide once again. But why?</p>
<p>[Some spoilers in this document have been removed.]</p>
<p>Some sentences that were previously marked as 'spoilers' have been released.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>A common experience was observed in all passengers who survived without using the 'Crime Zone' in the subway.</p>
<p>All passengers who successfully escaped stated that 「the subway lights blinked three times」.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>The subway lights blinked three times.</p>
<p>It was an incredibly crucial hint. So, what I have to do is make the subway lights blink three times.</p>
<p>Should I cause a power outage?</p>
<p>"Cheon Inho."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Is that how you see it?"</p>
<p>Anna Croft tilted her head slightly, so I hurriedly hid my phone and answered.</p>
<p>"I just read some web novels."</p>
<p>"Novels? You're reading novels in this situation? Are you crazy?"</p>
<p>Anna Croft glared at me like she was looking at a bug, then made a resigned expression.</p>
<p>"I used to read a lot of novels, too."</p>
<p>At that moment, my vision went black for a moment and then came back. My mind was blank.</p>
<p>What? What just happened?</p>
<p>Anna Croft also looked surprised. She hurriedly looked aRound and muttered quietly.</p>
<p>"Is it a power outage?"</p>
<p>My mind felt brighter at the word power outage.</p>
<p>"Anna Croft. Please continue what you were just saying."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? A power outage?"</p>
<p>"No, you were talking about novels."</p>
<p>"What’s the big deal about that right now—"</p>
<p>"Listen to me."</p>
<p>Anna Croft nodded her head slightly at my serious tone.</p>
<p>"But what else do I have to say…"</p>
<p>"Hmm."</p>
<p>I realized that this person is also quite inexperienced at having conversations.</p>
<p>After all, she is a 'Prophet'.</p>
<p>A being who can read the past and the future. In a sense, she is a character as 'omniscient' as Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>Would a prophet who knows all of someone’s shortcomings and secrets before they even become close to her really make an effort to build deep relationships with others?</p>
<p>Perhaps all humans would look like characters with past and future plots in front of her.</p>
<p>Thinking about it that way, I could finally understand Anna Croft’s attitude toward her colleagues.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I am a more social person than Kim Dokja or Anna Croft.</p>
<p>"Do you have a favorite author?"</p>
<p>"Ah."</p>
<p>Anna Croft nodded belatedly and answered.</p>
<p>"There is."</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>"Ted Chang, Charles Yu, Liu Cixin. And…"</p>
<p>I smiled, feeling like I expected it.</p>
<p>Well, Anna wouldn't read web novels.</p>
<p>Anna Croft let out a snarl, interpreting my smile.</p>
<p>"Are you making fun of my reading tastes?"</p>
<p>"No, I just laughed because I thought it suited you well."</p>
<p>"Who do you like?"</p>
<p>"My favorite author."</p>
<p>I muttered, looking at the letters shining on the screen of my smartphone.</p>
<p>"It's someone named Han Sooyoung."</p>
<p>Anna Croft muttered, "Han Sooyoung," and tilted her head.</p>
<p>"I've never heard of that author before. Is she a famous author in Korea?"</p>
<p>"In some worldline."</p>
<p>Anna Croft tilted her head for a moment, as if imagining a worldline where Han Sooyoung is famous.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I was staring at the ceiling light. The light was flickering, emitting an uncertain light that seemed to be fading.</p>
<p>It was almost like a blink, which was a pity.</p>
<p>Is this not enough?</p>
<p>In that case, I had no choice but to resort to a desperate measure.</p>
<p>"Anna Croft, what role will I assign you from now on?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"You are Korean from now on and your name is Kim Anna."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Ms. Kim Anna. Do you speak Spanish?"</p>
<p>Kim Anna looked at me with her typical bewildered expression, then answered as if she had no choice but to follow along.</p>
<p>"I know a little bit."</p>
<p>"Puede prestarme dinero."</p>
<p>Kim Anna asked back with a dumbfounded expression.</p>
<p>"Why are you suddenly asking me to lend you money?"</p>
<p>"Do you have any apps you can recommend for me?"</p>
<p>"Apps?"</p>
<p>"Like apps to learn Spanish."</p>
<p>"Cheon Inho. What the hell are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"Inho has an Inho's life."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"And Anna has an Anna's life."</p>
<p>At that moment, the lights flickered again.</p>
<p>I felt a surge of joy inside.</p>
<p>As expected, my guess was right.</p>
<p>Anna Croft asked back in a bewildered voice.</p>
<p>"What did you do just now?"</p>
<p>"Be quiet."</p>
<p>It was clear now.</p>
<p>I muttered as I looked back at the passengers. I don’t know if it was one of them or someone outside this space.</p>
<p>"We’re being 'audited' right now."</p>
<p>Someone was watching us here.</p>
<p>"What—"</p>
<p>"Do you remember what the First Scenario was?"</p>
<p>The First Scenario was about 'killing a living being'.</p>
<p>The name of the scenario was 'Proof of Worth'.</p>
<p>Proof of Worth.</p>
<p>Every incarnation had to prove their 'worth' to 'someone' through the First Scenario.</p>
<p>Anna, who had been looking aRound, asked with a hardened expression.</p>
<p>"No way. The Constellations are watching?"</p>
<p>"Not Constellations."</p>
<p>"Then?"</p>
<p>"I don’t know. I think we have to make them happy to get out."</p>
<p>The lights had blinked twice so far. And both of those blinks happened when I parodied the development of the 'main story'.</p>
<p>But now there was no more main story content to parody. The situation where even the 'Reader's Life', which was a desperate measure, was used. In terms of the main story development, this was the 'beginning of the scenario'.</p>
<p>It means that the 'Crime Zone' must open.</p>
<p>"Then the 'Crime Zone' is..."</p>
<p>"It would have been the easiest way to entertain someone."</p>
<p>In fact, I had a vague idea of ​​who that 'someone' was.</p>
<p>「At least this Fear is related to Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>In the first place, the only people who would enjoy watching the parody of the main story would be Kim Dokja or Kim Dokja's acquaintances.</p>
<p>Then, the way to make the subway lights blink is simple.</p>
<p>All I had to do was start a story that would make even that 'Kim Dokja' curious.</p>
<p>"Anna Croft."</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was with someone who knew one of those stories.</p>
<p>"I want to know exactly what happened in the last 40th Round."</p>
<p>This was also something I was curious about.</p>
<p>Anna Croft asked, lightly puffing out one cheek and then bursting it.</p>
<p>"Cheon Inho. What are you up to? I'd rather ask you about the last Round."</p>
<p>"I don't know much because I lost my memories of that Round. What happened? What did I do? Why do you and Yoo Joonghyuk hate me so much."</p>
<p>A story I should have found out a long time ago, but kept putting off.</p>
<p>"I don't know anything. That's why I want to know."</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, an old memory suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p>The red coat. The wings of the Demon King, the being called 'the Evil Sophist' by the Constellations.</p>
<p>The two blades that crossed to kill each other.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a question I should have asked a long time ago. In order to meet the Second Kim Dokja, to become a proper comrade with Yoo Joonghyuk, in order to resolve this 'Fear', I—</p>
<p>"Who on earth is 'Cheon Inho' from the 40th Round?"</p>
<p>I need to know exactly who I am first.</p>
