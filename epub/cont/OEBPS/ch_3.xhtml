<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">555 Episode 1. The World After The End (2)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>―Ah, ah. Microphone test.</p>
<p>Was this how the characters felt when they first saw Bihyung on the subway?</p>
<p>―Do you all hear me?</p>
<p>The woman on the screen was so similar to the Han Sooyoung I imagined that I got goosebumps.</p>
<p>Maybe I wasn't the only one who thought so, the other readers were also looking at the screen with their mouths open.</p>
<p>―There are still people who remember that guy’s story. Well, you were all Kim Dokja, too.</p>
<p>It was Han Sooyoung, perfect down to her rude way of speaking. It was probably made by applying deepfake technology, but whoever played her was really amazing.</p>
<p>But Han Sooyoung suddenly started saying strange things.</p>
<p>―I sent a short side story to the cloud a while ago, have you all read it?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>―Of course you saw it. I know. But this was just an appetizer. The real 'side story' will begin soon.</p>
<p>No, wait a minute. What if you say that when I don't have any chapter ready yet?</p>
<p>Give me the manuscript right now.</p>
<p>―So, I’ll ask you to take care of me in the future. Finally, you get one question.</p>
<p>The readers who were staring at the screen looked at each other.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung added.</p>
<p>―Please tell me where you bought Yoo Joonghyuk's boots, please tell me if Gilyoung eats grasshoppers or not, I don't know anything about this, so please take note in advance.</p>
<p>Someone sighed as if it was a pity.</p>
<p>Readers seemed to hesitate whether they could really ask questions.</p>
<p>Well, that's just a recorded video in the first place, so even if you ask a question, you won't get an answer.</p>
<p>But there was a person who raised her hand.</p>
<p>"Is Kim Dokja back to life?"</p>
<p>It was a small girl fan sitting in the front row.</p>
<p>A brief silence fell over the room.</p>
<p>A question that any reader who has read the final chapter would be curious about.</p>
<p>In a sense, everyone knows the answer, so it's a question that can't be answered.</p>
<p>I felt sad. If Han Sooyoung in that video is really Han Sooyoung, she will feel the same as me.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>―Oh, yeah. You mean Kim Dokja, right?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>―That's...</p>
<p>Was it a real-time video?</p>
<p>And the next moment, the screen turned off with a tsutsutsu sound.</p>
<p>An exclamation came from the audience.</p>
<p>"Oh, unfortunately, the signal was cut off. Let's check whether Kim Dokja is alive or not in the side story together!"</p>
<p>Indeed, the host's skillful hosting was at a level comparable to Kim Dokja's.</p>
<p>I could hear readers chatting with excitement.</p>
<p>"Is a side story really coming out?"</p>
<p>“I don’t think it was ever announced separately.”</p>
<p>Of course. Because I've never actually announced it.</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu, who was sitting next to me, whispered playfully.</p>
<p>"Isn't it a cute threat to start serializing it soon?"</p>
<p>"No, but that's too earnest."</p>
<p>While I let out a light sigh, the host was introducing the final segment.</p>
<p>"Then it’s time for today's last event, the ORV quiz. We’ve prepared enough prizes so that everyone can be rewarded equally, so if you get a question right, please come up to the stage right away."</p>
<p>Looking at the readers’ eyes shining, it seemed that this was the main event.</p>
<p>The host standing in front of the screen read the question.</p>
<p>"The first question is―"</p>
<p>After reading the question, the readers raised their hands. It was unexpected. I thought it was a pretty difficult question.</p>
<p>When the designated reader gave his answer, the host clapped his hands.</p>
<p>"Congratulations. Please come this way."</p>
<p>The reader with a flushed face was guided by the host and entered the curtain behind the screen.</p>
<p>After a while, the reader's presence disappeared with a tsutsutsu sound.</p>
<p>I laughed, and so did the readers.</p>
<p>It's an interesting directing.</p>
<p>Let's try to guess it this time.</p>
<p>"Now, the second question. How many times did ■ appear in the whole 'ORV'?</p>
<p>Ahem...</p>
<p>No matter how much I thought about it, I wondered who would know that.</p>
<p>Even I, the writer, don't know.</p>
<p>But there was a person who raised their hand.</p>
<p>"Me! The answer is―”</p>
<p>The reader raised their hand and started talking. Of course, I thought they were saying any number, but surprisingly, the host clapped his hands.</p>
<p>"Congratulations. Please come this way."</p>
<p>How on earth did you get it right?</p>
<p>The reader who correctly answered the second question also disappeared inside the curtain after being guided by the host.</p>
<p>The host said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Are the questions too difficult? This time it's an easy question!"</p>
<p>I focused on the host's words.</p>
<p>Okay, this time for sure.</p>
<p>"Third question. In 'Ways of Survival', Yoo Joonghyuk regresses 1,863 times. What does the number '1,863' symbolize here?</p>
<p>I was stunned for a moment after hearing the question.</p>
<p>What symbol was there in that number?</p>
<p>I guessed for what purpose ORV’s author used the number 1,863.</p>
<p>I think... The author had no intention. It's definitely the case. I know it well because I'm the author of ORV.</p>
<p>This time, there were quite a lot of readers who raised their hands.</p>
<p>When the host pointed to someone, the reader spoke.</p>
<p>"1,863 is the year when the world's first subway opened, symbolizing that Yoo Joonghyuk's repeated regressions circle back to the subway."</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I thought, ‘That can’t be true,’ but the readers around me agreed.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's right, that's right. It was that."</p>
<p>"Ah, I saw it in RepresentativeKimDokja’s analysis article."</p>
<p>As the host clapped his hands, the reader who had given the answer went up to the stage with a smile.</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu asked me,</p>
<p>"Did 1,863 really have that meaning?"</p>
<p>"Of course. In what I wrote, every single number has meaning. Every element is connected in an amazing way."</p>
<p>The quiz continued.</p>
<p>Some questions were about things I knew, and for some I didn't know the answer at all.</p>
<p>However, as words were exchanged, I felt indescribable emotions.</p>
<p>A story I remember. A story I don't remember. Even stories I didn’t intend to tell. The story I hadn't written for the past three years was still continuing here.</p>
<p>I suddenly had such a question.</p>
<p>Can I say that I love this story more than them?</p>
<p>"What is the name of the sword that Jung Heewon received as a gift from Kim Dokja in the Theater Dungeon?"</p>
<p>"Me! Me!"</p>
<p>Judge Heewon, who was sitting next to me, also managed to get one question right.</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu muttered in a nervous voice as she watched him excitedly pull back the curtains and disappear.</p>
<p>“If this continues, we’ll be the only ones left. Is there a penalty for staying behind?”</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu also began to raise her hand from then on.</p>
<p>After about ten or twenty questions, Ji Eunyu got an answer right.</p>
<p>"I'll go first. See you outside."</p>
<p>Even after Ji Eunyu waved her hand and disappeared, I didn't raise my hand.</p>
<p>The struggling readers also stood up from their seats one by one after answering a question correctly.</p>
<p>There were also readers who suddenly wiped away tears.</p>
<p>I watched them leave the theater for a long time.</p>
<p>"Now there's the last question left."</p>
<p>A voice that echoes through the silent theater.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was the only one left in the audience.</p>
<p>Looking at the countless empty seats in the front row, I thought about the person named “Kim Dokja” for the first time in a long time.</p>
<p>"This is the final question."</p>
<p>I was nervous and listened to the question.</p>
<p>There should be an easy question.</p>
<p>The host asked with a bright smile.</p>
<p>"Who is the heroine of ORV?"</p>
<p>I opened my mouth for a moment then closed it again.</p>
<p>Maybe sensing my embarrassment, the host added to reassure me,</p>
<p>"I'll give you a minute to think."</p>
<p>ORV’s heroine.</p>
<p>Who would Kim Dokja think of as a heroine? I don't know. Because I'm not Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>So, I decided to think about it from the perspective of ORV’s writer, “Writer Lee.”</p>
<p>「Who is the heroine of ORV?」</p>
<p>In fact, since “ORV” was not a story written with a heroine in mind, the proportion of romance was almost non-existent.</p>
<p>"10 seconds left."</p>
<p>"The heroine of ORV―”</p>
<p>I said the name of the heroine I was thinking of. I wasn’t sure if he was talking about this person. Compared to other main characters, she didn’t appear that much.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, that person was a person I made for Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>The host was silent for a moment at my answer then asked,</p>
<p>"Why do you think so?"</p>
<p>I'm probably not the one who loves this story the most.</p>
<p>I may not be the one who knows this story best.</p>
<p>But I wanted to say this at least once.</p>
<p>"Because I wrote it."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>The host asked back as if he hadn't heard it properly.</p>
<p>I smiled bitterly and raised my voice.</p>
<p>"Because she's my favorite person."</p>
<p>I couldn't tell if my answer was the right answer or not.</p>
<p>However, the host nodded without saying a word, and slowly clapped his hands.</p>
<p>Is that right or wrong?</p>
<p>When I think about it, the host has never once said “correct answer” so far.</p>
<p>"Congratulations."</p>
<p>With the host's words, I walked down the stairs of the theater and went to the stage.</p>
<p>As I followed the path that the readers had walked down before me, the empty seats of the theater came into view.</p>
<p>The words [Fourth Wall] were faintly glowing on the screen.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I remembered the readers who walked down this road, wiping their eyes, and the readers who were smiling and looking back every now and then.</p>
<p>Only then did I seem to know their feelings. They didn't cry or laugh because they were happy to get a question right.</p>
<p>Because this is the completion of 『Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint』.</p>
<p>I felt like I was going down the road that I should have gone down a long time ago.</p>
<p>The readers reached the end point in their own way, and now it was my turn.</p>
<p>When I went up the stage, the host was waiting for me. We looked at each other for a moment on stage.</p>
<p>The host looked at the nickname written on my name tag.</p>
<p>[■■■]</p>
<p>"Your nickname is very hard to pronounce."</p>
<p>I smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>Even though I saw it up close, I couldn't see the host's face well. The voice was strangely neutral, so I couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman.</p>
<p>I suddenly wanted to ask if he was “RepresentativeKimDokja.” But I didn't ask. I thought I wasn’t qualified to ask.</p>
<p>"The goods are beyond the curtain. You can just pick it up and leave."</p>
<p>I was a little excited when I heard that it was a product.</p>
<p>What is it? A cultural gift certificate?</p>
<p>I reached out to the curtain of the stage. Then I stopped. Because if I open this curtain, I really thought this story would end.</p>
<p>Isn't there still a story left to write?</p>
<p>There are sentences that I forgot and words that I haven't written.</p>
<p>At the last moment, I looked back. I thought there were still people left.</p>
<p>And if someone was there, I thought I wanted to write a story for that person.</p>
<p>But there was really someone in the place I looked back.</p>
<p>When did he move there?</p>
<p>The host was waving in the middle of the audience.</p>
<p>You can see the audience better than I thought on the stage.</p>
<p>I waved back at the host, then slowly turned back and pulled back the curtain.</p>
<p>Now, it was time to live in the world after the end.</p>
<p>"Are you really going to end it like this?"</p>
<p>But at that time.</p>
<p>“If you finish it on your own, what will the rest of us do?”</p>
<p>I heard the host's words.</p>
<p>Yes? The moment I was about to answer, I heard a tsutsutsutsu sound from somewhere. I reflexively held my cell phone. It wasn't the phone vibrating.</p>
<p>"So, please tell me that story."</p>
<p>Something was swirling in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>The vortex sucked me in, including the sound in my mouth. Sparks flew in front of me and my vision flickered. It felt like someone had rolled my body into a ball and thrown me into a subway that kept repeating infinite sudden stops.</p>
<p>My mouth tasted a bit like vomit after holding my breath.</p>
<p>And when I opened my eyes.</p>
<p>「I was really on the subway.」</p>
<p>A slightly higher field of view than usual.</p>
<p>A lukewarm wind blew from the vent hanging from the ceiling. Smelling the strangely musty smell of underground dust, I blinked.</p>
<p>The vague sensation of floating slowly clung to my skin, and a sense of reality gradually returned.</p>
<p>「To be exact, it was a subway station.」</p>
<p>Why am I here? As soon as I asked the question, an answer emerged from deep within my mind.</p>
<p>I already know where this place is.</p>
<p>「“But author-nim, why did you start on the subway?”」</p>
<p>One day, Ji Eunyu asked me that.</p>
<p>「“Because it's the most natural place.”」</p>
<p>But I couldn't accept that answer.</p>
<p>"What the hell is this?"</p>
<p>I was surprised at how unnatural the voice that came out of my mouth was.</p>
<p>I looked forward reflexively.</p>
<p>On the screen door, a man with narrow eyes was looking at me, not “Lee Hakhyun.”</p>
<p>"No―"</p>
<p>An unknown cell phone was in my hand.</p>
<p>I absentmindedly pressed the phone’s power button.</p>
<p>「It was just a coincidence that I looked at the time at that moment.」</p>
<p>The clock numbers on the phone changed with a ticking sound.</p>
<p>7:00 PM.</p>
<p>The moment I raised my head, I heard a message from somewhere along with a small explosion.</p>
<p>[The free service of planetary system 8612 has been terminated.]</p>
<p>[The main scenario has started.]</p>
<p>I knew the sentence that would follow very well.</p>
<p>「It was the moment the genre of my life changed.」</p>
<p>That was not what I thought.</p>
<p>「So.」</p>
<p>At that moment, I was “thinking.”</p>
<p>「I entered 『Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint』.」</p>
