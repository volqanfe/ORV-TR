<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">752 Episode 31 Yoo Joonghyuk (4)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>After 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' left, a message was released.</p>
<p>[Due to the scenario's direct change, the start date of the 'Zodiac Ball' is adjusted.]</p>
<p>[The 'Zodiac Ball' will begin in 12 hours.]</p>
<p>[Currently, 71% of the prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]</p>
<p>[To participate in the 'Zodiac Ball' you must secure an additional 9%.]</p>
<p>In the process of fighting the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake', our approval rating actually rose despite the fact that a huge number of prisoners died.</p>
<p>"I never thought there would be an incarnation that could stand against the &lt;Zodiac&gt;…"</p>
<p>Someone had expectations of us.</p>
<p>"Zone 13 is in the spotlight because of you guys."</p>
<p>Someone criticized us.</p>
<p>"I think it would be a good idea to leave Zone 13 at this point."</p>
<p>Some people advised us to give up on Zone 13.</p>
<p>He was the crane owner in 「The Fox and the Crane」.</p>
<p>"I would welcome any of the zodiac signs. I have never seen such an outstanding incarnation at Zone 13 of the 'Recycling Center'."</p>
<p>According to the system, the story of exterminating the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' was widely known throughout Star Stream through the center director.</p>
<p>[Your new tale spreads widely throughout the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.]</p>
<p>[Some Constellations were greatly impressed by your story.]</p>
<p>[18,000 coins were donated through the 'Recycling Center'.]</p>
<p>As evidence, messages were still being delivered in real time.</p>
<p>[A few Nebulae want you to join them.]</p>
<p>[The Nebula &lt;Hongik&gt; invites you.]</p>
<p>[The Nebula &lt;Tamra&gt; invites you.]</p>
<p>[The Nebula &lt;Samyo&gt; invites you.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The small and medium-sized Nebulae that were being pushed out by the Giant Nebulae sent me messages to do business with me.</p>
<p>Among them, there were even &lt;Hongik&gt; and &lt;Tamna&gt;, the Nebulae of the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>I was curious because it was Nebulae that did not appear properly in the main story, but I had no intention of choosing them here.</p>
<p>This was because we were still trapped in the 'Recycling Center' and the scenario related to the &lt;Zodiac&gt; was still in progress.</p>
<p>[The faction 'Monkey God' invites you to the 'Zodiac Ball'.]</p>
<p>[The faction 'Dragon God' invites you to the 'Zodiac Ball'.]</p>
<p>Some factions of the Zodiac also sent invitations to me, as if word had spread that I had declined the tiger's invitation.</p>
<p>"I have no intention of entering &lt;Zodiac&gt;.»</p>
<p>But I didn't come this far just to join that animal union.</p>
<p>"I will attend the 'Zodiac Ball' without anyone’s sponsorship."</p>
<p>I needed the support of eighty percent of the prisoners.</p>
<p>And that was the reason why I was now meeting the crane owner.</p>
<p>"Many prisoners, including me, are already supporting you."</p>
<p>The crane owner, who already knew my situation, sighed lightly and continued.</p>
<p>"But there has never been a representative whose approval rating exceeded 80% in Zone 13."</p>
<p>"Just because it’s never happened doesn’t mean it’s impossible."</p>
<p>"Now the only ones left are the bears and some other beastmen. But it will be difficult to gain their support."</p>
<p>The prisoners nearby are all supporting me. The only exceptions were the bears that followed the Tiger, and their subordinate forces.</p>
<p>But no matter what I did, I could not persuade them.</p>
<p>"Because they don’t have any stories left that you can repair."</p>
<p>The prisoners who we were able to persuade all had 'forgotten stories'.</p>
<p>We revived those stories through 「Staging」and spread them through the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p>The prisoners supported us in return. But in the case of the bear beastmen, that was impossible.</p>
<p>"Is there no way?"</p>
<p>"Honestly, there is none. Wouldn’t it be great if you were a Constellation like the 'Master of Fables'? Isn’t it impossible to give individual stories to all of them?"</p>
<p>"If it's the owner of fables, you're probably referring to the Constellation that wrote 'Aesop's Fables'."</p>
<p>"That’s right. We don’t have enough time."</p>
<p>"They are not people who can listen by simply threatening them with force. In particular, the 'Bear That Will Spare You If You Pretend To Be Dead' is a Constellation with strong pride."</p>
<p>He looked down at Yoo Joonghyuk, who was sleeping soundly on the bed, and added:</p>
<p>"Perhaps there is a 'story' that can sweep them all away at once. Can you help me with this?"</p>
<p>I helped the crane owner  wake Yoo Joonghyuk up from his sleep and fed him some soup. It was a special soup with the story of 「The Fox and the Crane」.</p>
<p>He's the kind of guy who never eats food made by someone else, so I was glad he was unconscious right now.</p>
<p>After feeding him some soup, Yoo Joonghyuk's pale complexion became a little more lively.</p>
<p>The crane owner sighed lightly and said.</p>
<p>"Anyway, this guy got smaller again, but I was really scared when he cut down the</p>
<p>"I’m glad he's smaller."</p>
<p>"Anyway, take care of him. I’ll come again."</p>
<p>With those last words, the crane owner left the room.</p>
<p>I took a few bites of the soup the owner left behind and looked at Yoo Joonghyuk who was sleeping for a moment.</p>
<p>After that incident three days ago, Yoo Joonghyuk had been sleeping ever since.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the side effects of [Story Engraving], Yoo Joonghyuk became little Yoo Joonghyuk again.</p>
<p>He wasn't as small as the little Yoo Joonghyuk I saw in the snowfield, but he would probably be like this for a while anyway.</p>
<p>The 41st Round was the last Round for Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>He transmitted his experience to his past self through Shin Yoosoung and exited the record of 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p>I repeat, no one knows what happened to that guy after he left.</p>
<p>Has he stopped regressing in some way, or has he disappeared forever from his records in some way I don't know?</p>
<p>If he had disappeared from his records, would he have finally achieved his wish?</p>
<p>"Don’t worry too much."</p>
<p>I muttered as I covered the sleeping little boy, Yoo Joonghyuk, with a blanket.</p>
<p>"Because this Round won’t be ruined so easily."</p>
<p>The person who starts a story has a responsibility not to give up on it.</p>
<p>I made a promise to Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>[The story 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear' responds to your oath.]</p>
<p>This story may not be 『Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World』 or 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』, but it will definitely have the right ending.</p>
<p>Now it was time to go see the end of this Round for that conclusion.</p>
<hr/>
<p>An hour later, I gathered together the Bear Beastmen and the Beastmen who had not expressed support.</p>
<p>The guys seemed taken aback or confused by my sudden call.</p>
<p>Some even reacted with hostility .</p>
<p>[Why did you call us?]</p>
<p>Their representative was the Constellation that invaded this place—'Bear That Will Spare You If You Pretend To Be Dead'.</p>
<p>[If you're calling us to support you, you'd better give up.]</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>[Because we have no intention of supporting you.]</p>
<p>"So why?"</p>
<p>[There is no reason to explain that.]</p>
<p>"Of course you will.</p>
<p>I squatted down in my seat and let out a deep sigh. Then I looked up at the guys.</p>
<p>"But you… is it okay for you to continue like that?"</p>
<p>No matter what I say, they won't be persuaded by me.</p>
<p>The reason is obvious.</p>
<p>Because they don't need my help.</p>
<p>What should we do for those who have lost their stories?</p>
<p>Maybe I've been thinking about this problem for quite some time.</p>
<p>Some extras found their own stories on their own. Like Bang Cheolsoo from Geumho Station. Like the mother and daughter. Like the crane owner.</p>
<p>But not everyone could do it like they did.</p>
<p>Some people find their own stories, but others live and die without even knowing what their stories are.</p>
<p>For example, like the bears in front of me right now.</p>
<p>"Honestly, it doesn’t really matter whether you support me or not. I can rise to the top somehow."</p>
<p>[Then why did you call us?]</p>
<p>"To give you one last chance."</p>
<p>I know that not everyone can purely support me.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja also knew that.</p>
<p>No matter what he did, some Constellations hated Kim Dokja's story.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja pioneered his life by fighting against that gaze, and eventually it also became his story.</p>
<p>But it wasn't easy for me to accept it.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because I'm a 'writer'.</p>
<p>I wanted to write a perfect story that Kim Dokja had never read and that he didn't know about.</p>
<p>[The story 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear' responds to your emotions.]</p>
<p>But it was impossible.</p>
<p>I finally realized it as I went through Geumho Station, Chungmuro, the Theater Dungeon, Gwanghwamun, Washington Dome, and the Recycling Center.</p>
<p>There is no story that all the Constellations in the world love.</p>
<p>Even more so if it is the story of the 'Forgotten Round'.</p>
<p>So I accepted.</p>
<p>It's okay even if not all prisoners support me. It's safe to say that they hate the stories I'm going to write.</p>
<p>"This is truly your last chance. Your chance to choose me by yourself."</p>
<p>But I just write stories.</p>
<p>[What does that mean?]</p>
<p>"I don’t think there’s any reason to explain what it means."</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Bear That Spares One's Life if One Pretends To Be Dead' is outraged!]</p>
<p>Even a Constellation that has lost all of its status still has pride.</p>
<p>[How dare a mere incarnation carry beastmen on its back—!]</p>
<p>But he misjudged.</p>
<p>"It’s not just an incarnation."</p>
<p>I grinned and looked at him.</p>
<p>Until a few days ago, its power was threatening. I thought that he would be a difficult enemy to defeat if I did not use 『Staging』.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>"Has your eyesight deteriorated and you’ve forgotten how to read stories?"</p>
<p>His status no longer seemed great to me.</p>
<p>I slowly stood up.</p>
<p>[You are currently acting as the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]</p>
<p>[The status of the Constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' rests fully upon you.]</p>
<p>As my entire body radiated the majestic energy of stories, bright light began to flow from my incarnation body.</p>
<p>Some of the prisoners who noticed it were frightened and bowed their heads.</p>
<p>"Stand, the Constellation…!"</p>
<p>Even the 'Bear That Spares One's Life if One Pretends To Be Dead' was looking at me with shocked eyes.</p>
<p>As I lightly placed my hand on the guy's shoulder, his knees slowly began to buckle.</p>
<p>The guy shouted as if he was struggling.</p>
<p>[No matter what you do, it’s useless. We will never do your favor—]</p>
<p>"Oh, did that sound like a request?"</p>
<p>A way to persuade those who have lost their stories, lost their memories, and ultimately lost the ability to read.</p>
<p>"I’ll tell you again. You only have one choice."</p>
<p>The crane owner said. Those who have lost their own stories are just being swept away by other 'stories' like a torrent.</p>
<p>So the only way to persuade them is through 'stories'.</p>
<p>[The story begins 'Incite'.]</p>
<p>So, the method I would choose was decided.</p>
<p>[Support me.]</p>
<p>It becomes the story of 'I will sweep them all away'.</p>
<p>[It must be scary to jump into the scenarios again. I know. That's why I'm saying it.]</p>
<p>I saw the confused beastmen looking up at me one by one. A faint trace of emotion passed through their dead eyes.</p>
<p>[At least as long as you support me, I will be your 'story'. I will fight on your behalf and become a laughingstock for the Constellations on your behalf.]</p>
<p>My persuasion was not persuasion.</p>
<p>My words will not be heard in their ears. They are simply overwhelmed by my story and crushed by the status of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p>So their choice now is,</p>
<p>[Just support me. Then at least you will be able to see the end of this world through me.]</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn't a choice.</p>
<p>[Your approval rating begins to rise.]</p>
<p>[Your approval rating has reached a certain level.]</p>
<p>[Currently, 83% of prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]</p>
<p>It was an easy and clear ending.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is scolding you for not doing this sooner.]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Reclining Dragon' says that sometimes a decision like that of an 'Adventurer Who Laid An Egg' is needed.]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'The One Who Brought Ten Lambs' looks at you sadly.]</p>
<p>And as always, clear cider,</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Bear That Spares One's Life if One Pretends To Be Dead' rejects your instigation.]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Bear That Spares One's Life if One Pretends To Be Dead' loses his story and chooses to disappear.]</p>
<p>The aftertaste was bitter.</p>
<p>[You have obtained permission to attend the 'Zodiac Ball'.]</p>
