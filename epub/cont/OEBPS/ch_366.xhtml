<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">918 Episode 52 Mad Sword Emperor (3)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>A suffocating storm of white and blue struck the manor.</p>
<p>The three Ascendants, their faces paling, simultaneously dodged.</p>
<p>A spark of probability erupted eerily from the dust.</p>
<p>Sentences then emerged.</p>
<p>「This power? Could that Constellation be...?」</p>
<p>「That can't be. That Constellation must have died then!」</p>
<p>「Nonsense...!」</p>
<p>Sentences that seemed to be the inner thoughts of the Recorders. They didn't seem to have been written directly by them; perhaps they were part of their subconscious.</p>
<p>"Everyone, wake up! The record is leaking!"</p>
<p>The 'Unchanging One' warned, and the intermittent lines of text abruptly cut off.</p>
<p>"Don't panic! It's the same as a Narrative-grade! And there are three of us!"</p>
<p>Perhaps not yet fully grasping the situation, the Ascendants seemed to be regrouping. I said to those guys.</p>
<p>"They're not the same Narrative-grade."</p>
<p>Five stars shining from my entire body. I gradually drew on the power contained within the Constellation.</p>
<p>[Your incarnation is overloaded!]</p>
<p>Power acquired after enduring the 1,863rd Round with Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p>AKA 'Demon King of Salvation' mode.</p>
<p>Use time is approximately 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Instantaneous combat power is 'late stage of Narrative-grade.'</p>
<p>"Wh, what... the level keeps rising!"</p>
<p>"Don't be intimidated by the level alone! I've heard information about that guy! That Constellation's combat prowess isn't that great compared to its level!"</p>
<p>I was a little surprised by the accuracy of the information.</p>
<p>As he said, the 'Demon King of Salvation' didn't have great combat skills compared to his level.</p>
<p>But the reason the 'Demon King of Salvation' is so scary isn't because of his 'powerful techniques'.</p>
<p>"Heir-ah, I'll borrow another story."</p>
<p>With a tsutsutsu, a new story was added to the constellation.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Insect Massacre', begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>Story 「Insect Massacre」.</p>
<p>A story that unleashes overwhelming power when the opponent is 'weaker' than the story's owner.</p>
<p>The sphere surrounding my incarnation body began to glow even brighter.</p>
<p>[This story resonates with the constellation 'Demon King of Salvation'!]</p>
<p>The reason the Demon King of Salvation is so terrifying is because his story affinity is unparalleled among other Constellations.</p>
<p>The story's power, instantly activated, took control of the entire area through my body.</p>
<p>"That's—"</p>
<p>The Ascendants, recognizing the story, retreated.</p>
<p>But it was too late.</p>
<p>In a flash, Baekcheong's sword swung, slicing off the head of one ascendant.</p>
<p>"First, one."</p>
<p>Even if it were the 'Insect Massacre' unleashed by the 'Demon King of Salvation', this story, born of 'Historical-grade' origins, wouldn't work well against beings possessing a certain level of power.</p>
<p>For example, with someone like Yoo Joonghyuk, who had only faced overwhelmingly stronger opponents, 'Insect Massacre' couldn't fully demonstrate its capabilities.</p>
<p>But the ones before me were different.</p>
<p>"R-R-Run! We must inform the other Ascendants!"</p>
<p>The Ascendants before me had relied solely on their own power, crushing only weaker opponents. That was why they were dying now. Their history had become their weakness.</p>
<p>"Two."</p>
<p>「 Baekcheong-Ganggi, overlaid with Way of the Wind, decapitated another ascendant.」</p>
<p>As the two incarnations crumbled in vain, the constellation's terrifying scream echoed through the air.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Horse-Possessing Twins', suffer a massive blow and are removed from the scenario!]</p>
<p>Interestingly, the recorders who recorded them are in a similar situation.</p>
<p>[The Recorder of Fear, 'One Who Writes Youth', loses his records and enters a period of inactivity.]</p>
<p>[The Recorder of Fear, 'One Who Doesn't Like Twists', loses his records and enters a period of inactivity.]</p>
<p>It seems the Recorders of Fear who signed a 'Recording Contract' take a major blow when the contracted incarnation dies.</p>
<p>So that's why Bihyung said I only need to deal with the contracted incarnation.</p>
<p>In any case, this leaves only one thing.</p>
<p>I turned my head to see a terrified Yoon Hyunseok preparing to flee.</p>
<p>Normally, he would have thrown a tantrum, having been cornered.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Unchanging One', lowers the synchronisation with the incarnation.]</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the guy's sponsor seemed to have made an unusual choice.</p>
<p>"Spo-Sponsor?"</p>
<p>Feeling his own status rapidly diminishing, Executive Director Yoon Hyunseok wore a blank expression.</p>
<p>"Hey, wait. Don't come! I told you not to come!"</p>
<p>If he were to lower his synchronisation with the incarnation in this situation, his purpose was clear.</p>
<p>Since this was a losing battle anyway, he'd probably lower his synchronisation to lessen the damage to his true form.</p>
<p>But I couldn't just let him run away. I pulled the 'Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword' from my pocket.</p>
<p>[The S+grade item 'Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword' evolves into the holy relic 'Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword.']</p>
<p>Originally, it could only be used with the power of the Big Dipper, but at the level of a Narrative-grade Constellation, it could be replaced with one's own Constellation.</p>
<p>My stories were imbued into the hilt of the 'Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword', and a bright starlight was engraved on its blade.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Unchanging One', looks at you in astonishment!]</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Unchanging One', implores you. If you do not kill its incarnation-]</p>
<p>Swinging the 'Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword', it slashed at its chest.</p>
<p>Immediately, a horrifying scream and the Constellation's message were heard.</p>
<p>[The Constellation, 'Unchanging One', suffered a massive blow and was forced out of the scenario!]</p>
<p>Leaving Yoon Hyunseok behind, who had collapsed to the ground, spilling his stories, I retrieved the D-Coins dropped by the dead executives.</p>
<p>[You have acquired a total of 25,300 D-Coins.]</p>
<p>As expected of an Executive, he had quite a lot of D-Coins.</p>
<p>At this rate, I should be able to collect 100,000 D-Coins in no time.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is retrieving the stories you borrowed.]</p>
<p>Just then, the time limit for 'Demon King of Salvation' mode expired. I tasted blood on my tongue. I forced myself to remain calm and swallowed my breath.</p>
<p>A faint spark coursed through my body.</p>
<p>I guess five stories is still too much.</p>
<p>"Benefactor, are you alright?"</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi—!"</p>
<p>I saw Namgung Myung and Kyung Sein, who had retreated for a moment, approaching.</p>
<p>I held out my palm to them, signaling them not to move.</p>
<p>Yoon Hyunseok's lifeline was still attached.</p>
<p>"Keuk..."</p>
<p>Even though he couldn't use the power of his sponsor, I couldn't let my guard down forever.</p>
<p>I approached him, maintaining [Baekcheong-ganggi].</p>
<p>"S-Spare me, spare me… "</p>
<p>I looked down at him and said,</p>
<p>"I have some questions for your 'Recorder'."</p>
<p>When I mentioned the Recorder's existence, Yoon Hyunseok's body trembled as if struck by lightning.</p>
<p>[The Recorder of Fear, the 'Unchanging One', is staring at you!]</p>
<p>Then, as if waiting, a message flashed through my mind.</p>
<p>[The Recorder of Fear, the 'Unchanging One', expects your generosity!]</p>
<p>There was a reason I kept him alive in the first place. There was information I needed to uncover.</p>
<p>What on earth are so many Recorders plotting in this city?</p>
<p>What are the Dokkaebis thinking hiring these guys?</p>
<p>Perhaps this 'Recorder' before me knows all that information.</p>
<p>"What do I get if I spare you?"</p>
<p>[The Recorder of Fear, the 'Unchanging One', offers D-Coins!]</p>
<p>"That's not necessary."</p>
<p>Considering what happened to my Eldest Brother, I had no intention of letting any of them live.</p>
<p>Still, I finally got the information. I couldn't miss this opportunity to rip it out.</p>
<p>But the next moment, instead of his answer, I heard his inner thoughts.</p>
<p>「Just a little more time.」</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>「It'll be 'that time' soon. If we take refuge in the 'Records Archive' before we lose the contract, we can avoid the end of writing...!」</p>
<p>Records Archive?</p>
<p>Sensing something odd, I was about to swing my sword at Yoon Hyunseok's arm when...</p>
<p>「Hahahaha! That's it! It's two o'clock!」</p>
<p>A bright light emanated from Yoon Hyunseok's entire body, and soon a translucent energy surged through him.</p>
<p>The next moment, what looked like a pen mark the guy had left rippled through the air. I reached out and firmly grasped it, and a message flashed before my eyes.</p>
<p>[Would you like to enter the 'Records Archive' in that area?]</p>
<p>Seeing the message, something occurred to me.</p>
<p>「"Hmm. I heard there's a separate space only the recorders can access..."」</p>
<p>It seems I've finally figured out where the 'subspace' Bihyung spoke of was.</p>
<hr/>
<p>A pure white, circular space reminiscent of a gigantic Colosseum. Fierce sentences were floating in real time above the space's margins.</p>
<p>「Blood Jade Fist Master Jo Jincheol shouted, "Damn it, Mad Sword Emperor! I won't miss this time!"」</p>
<p>「Paradise Emperor Reinheit gritted his teeth. "As expected, Mad Sword Emperor. she truly lives up toher reputation."」</p>
<p>「Nirvana, filled with madness, shouted, "Hahahaha! Where did you go!? Become one with me!"」</p>
<p>As various incidents unfolded in the city, a dozen or so recorders scribbled on the screens, examining each one.</p>
<p>「...Auction house unusual report...」</p>
<p>「...High-level fragment analysis. Currently assessing probability...」</p>
<p>What was unusual was that each recorder wore a mask. Most were blue or purple, but occasionally green and orange masks were seen.</p>
<p>The recorder wearing the orange mask spoke first.</p>
<p>【What happened to the order from the Nebula? Has there been any change?】</p>
<p>The green mask beside him answered.</p>
<p>【It's the same. I've protested several times, but they say the decision won't be reversed. The city will be closed in the next scenario.】</p>
<p>【Is that how it's going to end?】</p>
<p>The orange mask spoke in a dejected tone. The city's scenery was reflected in his eyes behind his mask.</p>
<p>「New Murim District.」</p>
<p>Until now, this city has been divided into two parts, the remnants of the fallen Fear Realm. Its lifespan was sustained by the power of the three.</p>
<p>The fragments of the Fear Realm that were occasionally unearthed were refined into 'D-Coins', and these 'D-Coins' were transmitted to the constellations in the higher scenarios, proving their worth.</p>
<p>However, the vitality of such a system was limited.</p>
<p>【If only the Mad Sword Emperor hadn't destroyed the Orbital Elevator...】</p>
<p>When the orbital elevator was destroyed, the D-Coin circulation route was blocked, and naturally, the Ascendants who had become stronger through D-Coins also found their path to ascending blocked.</p>
<p>A single incarnation brought the entire city's system to its knees.</p>
<p>【In fact, this was expected even without the Mad Sword Emperor. The story fragments found in the Fear Realm were practically nonexistent.】</p>
<p>The Mad Sword Emperor was merely a trigger. Perhaps the constellations in the higher scenarios simply concluded that the city had outlived its usefulness.</p>
<p>【That's true. Wasn't there a harvest worth using this week?】</p>
<p>【There was talk of an 'End-level fragment' being discovered during the day...】</p>
<p>【End-level fragment?】</p>
<p>【Yes. The situation was so absurd that the new recruits stepped in and altered the records. The 'Management Bureau' is also investigating the probability of the scale.】</p>
<p>【End-level fragment...】</p>
<p>【If that's true, the Giant Nebulae above might have changed their minds.】</p>
<p>The orange mask, who had been thinking so, shook his head.</p>
<p>【There's no way there's an End-level fragment of Fear.】</p>
<p>【If there were still such fragments, the 'Twelve Thrones' of &lt;Olympus&gt; and the 'Locapala' of &lt;Vedas&gt; would have already descended, turning the city upside down.】</p>
<p>【When is the next scenario launch?】</p>
<p>【It's in an hour.】</p>
<p>【The Mad Sword Emperor? Or are we just going to leave her alone?】</p>
<p>【A small [Fate] launch order will soon be issued from the 'Giant Nebulae'.】</p>
<p>「Fate.」</p>
<p>At that statement, the recorders in the room whispered.</p>
<p>【You're using [Fate] to deal with just one incarnation?】</p>
<p>【It's not just one incarnation. We've deployed Ascendants, but we still haven't caught him. It's an incarnation with combat power greater than that of a Narrative-grade heavy machine.】</p>
<p>The orange mask, listening to the recorders' conversation, asked.</p>
<p>【Where was he last seen?】</p>
<p>【Near &lt;Tamra Heavy Industry&gt;.】</p>
<p>【Then the objective is clear.】</p>
<p>The orange mask stared at the &lt;Tamra Heavy Industry&gt; headquarters on the screen.</p>
<p>In the basement of that company, a monster once sealed by the recorders was imprisoned.</p>
<p>The orange mask smiled faintly, as if thinking about something.</p>
<p>【Since it's come to this, let's create a proper finale. A scenario of this scale will surely interest even the 'high-ranking Recorders'.】</p>
<p>The objective of every 'Recorder of Fear' is clear. It was about completing the 'ultimate sentence' to be left on the 'Final Wall'.</p>
<p>However, not all Recorders were able to achieve this ultimate sentence. Only the chosen recorders left behind great records.</p>
<p>Therefore, most recorders wanted to write 'commentaries' to accompany such a 'great sentence'.</p>
<p>【Listen carefully, everyone. If we successfully complete this scenario, we might even be able to claim the 'commentary' position from the high-ranking Recorders who monopolize the interpretation of the wall.】</p>
<p>【Re-Really?】</p>
<p>【Yes.】</p>
<p>The Recorders' eyes were filled with fear and excitement. It was understandable, before them, were the 'high-ranking recorders' of the &lt;Star Stream&gt;, beings they couldn't even dare to listen to, let alone look at—even their true names.</p>
<p>But what if they could help these high-ranking Recorders complete the 'One Sentence'...?</p>
<p>Just then, one of the recorders, who had been scanning the screen, ran over.</p>
<p>【Urgent news. Two recorders just stopped writing.】</p>
<p>Stopped writing. The weight of these words made all the Recorders' expressions harden for a moment. For the Recorders, the 'stop writing' was a punishment akin to eternal destruction, in terms of constellations.</p>
<p>The orange mask asked.</p>
<p>【What kind of guys are they?】</p>
<p>【Newbies. They're called 'One Who Writes Youth' and 'One Who Doesn't Like Twists'.】</p>
<p>The orange mask's eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>No matter what they did in this city, it was unlikely to cause an incident worthy of 'stopping writing'.</p>
<p>【If there was a possibility, it would be if the embodiment of the 'Recording Contract' died.】</p>
<p>The orange mask spoke in a grave voice.</p>
<p>【Perhaps it was the work of that bastard, the Mad Sword Emperor.】</p>
<p>【The Mad Sword Emperor.】</p>
<p>The tense recorders exchanged glances.</p>
<p>【Dispatch ascenders to the nearby area. If the Mad Sword Emperor is discovered—】</p>
<p>The order was finally given.</p>
<p>【Prepare to declare [Fate] immediately.】</p>
<hr/>
<p>The 'Recorder of Fear' trembled before my eyes.</p>
<p>【Uh, how? How could this be happening?】</p>
<p>To put it simply, it was like this.</p>
<p>He moved to this 'Recording Center' as soon as it was two o'clock, and I followed him.</p>
<p>He was jubilant, thinking he'd escaped safely, but then he turned to me and looked as if he were about to faint.</p>
<p>Hurriedly, he collected his expression and began to speak.</p>
<p>【W-Wouldn't you be the same 'Recorder'? But how could the contract holder and the Recorder be the same person...?】</p>
<p>I stared at the 'Unchanging One'.</p>
<p>I expected him to have some impressive appearance since he was called a 'Recorder of Fear', but he was just a young man wearing glasses. Compared to 'Asmodeus' and 'Bichonhori' I'd met before, he felt like a mere idiot. My silence must have been what the guy was thinking, as he fell to the ground and cried out.</p>
<p>【Please save me! I will never touch your contract again! I will not come near you! I will not add a single conjunction or adverb to your presence!】</p>
<p>I watched him for a moment before opening my mouth.</p>
<p>But no sound came out. Is it impossible to speak audibly in this space? In that case…</p>
<p>【Do you speak like this?】</p>
<p>At that moment, the 'Unchanging One' heard my voice and opened his eyes wide.</p>
