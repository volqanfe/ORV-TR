<hr/>
<p>As my vision narrowed, I realized what was about to happen.</p>
<p>「The Demon King of Salvation wants to sacrifice himself.」</p>
<p>The situation is desperate. The Washington Dome was under siege by historical-grade constellations, and there was no constellation to help us.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, he was sentenced by [fate].</p>
<p>Kim Dokja made a decision in a situation where death was inevitable no matter what he did.</p>
<p>Only through his death can this obstacle be overcome.</p>
<p>'Stop!’</p>
<p>But I couldn't leave it like that.</p>
<p>This is my [fate]. It's my share to bear.</p>
<p>'Stop!'</p>
<p>There is no reason why the Demon King of Salvation should receive it instead.</p>
<p>'Kim Dokja!'</p>
<p>—You're not ready to fight them yet.</p>
<p>I felt like someone was supporting me.</p>
<p>I turned my head and saw Christina Page.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to say thank you, my eyes met hers with a faint hint of guilt. Her fingers moved with an ominous foreboding.</p>
<p>My vision went dark.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Christina Page.</p>
<p>Anna Croft's closest associate who leads 'Zarathustra'.</p>
<p>She is an FBI forensic hypnosis expert and is called 'Finger Snapper' in 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p>Just before she possessed this character, Olivia was playing TRPG with her friends.</p>
<p>'Kevin, Jim, Amelia.'</p>
<p>Olivia thought about her own friends.</p>
<p>She had friends who liked subculture.</p>
<p>Kevin only read webtoons with 'SSS' in the title.</p>
<p>Jim loved martial arts novels.</p>
<p>Amelia loved virtual idols.</p>
<p>'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' was a Korean web novel brought by Kevin.</p>
<p>—Guys, how are we supposed to survive once we enter this novel?</p>
<p>—Oh, Kevin. It's starting again.</p>
<p>—This is set in Korea. I think we'll be at a bit of a disadvantage.</p>
<p>—No, America is also included.</p>
<p>—Kevin, but the title of this novel doesn’t include 'SSS'?</p>
<p>ㅡ As you read, SSS appears. Olivia, can you write an email to the author? You said before that you have a Korean friend. Let's add this novel's world view in the next session.</p>
<p>What would it have been like if she hadn't listened to Kevin at that time?</p>
<p>If she hadn't sent the email to the author, all of this wouldn't have happened.</p>
<p>'Oh my God.'</p>
<p>It was sheer luck that she survived.</p>
<p>It turns out that the person who she possessed was 'Christina Page'.</p>
<p>She has always enjoyed playing TRPGs, so it wasn't difficult for her to play the role of 'Christina Page'. She was glad the task wasn't difficult.</p>
<p>Olivia was able to forget who she was, at least while she was playing 'Christina Page' .</p>
<p>—Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p>She could forget Kevin, forget herself, forget Amelia, forget her dead friends.</p>
<p>—Can you really save my friends?</p>
<p>A message from the 'Demon King of Salvation' delivered through the exclusive skill, [Nightmare].</p>
<p>—Yes.</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation said.</p>
<p>If she grants his request, he will definitely save her dead friends.</p>
<p>And the request is—</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Daily Invoice Lv.5' is activated!]</p>
<p>Christina hurriedly helped Cheon Inho, who fell in front of her.</p>
<p>She was startled to see Anna Croft stumbling in the distance.</p>
<p>"Christina! What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"It is the order of the Demon King of Salvation."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"He told me to place a [Daily Invoice] on his incarnation."</p>
<p>"What the hell is that—"</p>
<p>She doesn't know why the Demon King of Salvation made such a request.</p>
<p>"It doesn’t matter. This person can ignore my [daily invoice] and move his incarnation."</p>
<p>She doesn't know, but she thought they were planning to use [Daily Invoice] to fight.</p>
<p>The strange thing is why he communicated directly through [Nightmare] rather than using his incarnation.</p>
<p>"Then why doesn’t Cheon Inho wake up? Last time he woke up right away."</p>
<p>"I know that too—"</p>
<p>It was then that a bright beam of light burst from the Capitol.</p>
<p>This was the area where the 'sub-scenario' occurred earlier.</p>
<p>The place where the fake 'Demon King of Salvation' and the ‘black beast’ appeared.</p>
<p>However, the false Demon King of Salvation was defeated, and Yoo Joonghyuk, who became the Black Beast, also fainted.</p>
<p>The scenario has already ended.</p>
<p>But why are sparks flying around the Capitol?</p>
<p>"Christina. The cost is incorrect."</p>
<p>Dark clouds filled the sky and covered the Capitol.</p>
<p>A pitch-black thunderbolt falling between dark clouds.</p>
<p>[The 'Demon King of Salvation' is resurrected in the scenario.]</p>
<p>The demon king, who was thought to be dead, appeared in Washington.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The 'Dark Keeper', hugged in the warm abyss, thought.</p>
<p>「I.」</p>
<p>A question that has been asked for a very long time.</p>
<p>「Who am I?」</p>
<p>That moon gate was all that explained him. The answer he couldn't get even though he gave up all his resources.</p>
<p>In order to find it, the 'Dark Keeper' contracted with the dokkaebi and became part of the scenario.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,</p>
<p>「I was not the Demon King of Salvation.」</p>
<p>He couldn't find the answer he wanted.</p>
<p>There couldn't be an exact answer.</p>
<p>The stars turned away from him and the script abandoned him.</p>
<p>He is just a nameless character.</p>
<p>Or a monster that didn't even become a character. A consumable to make the main character shine.</p>
<p>「That’s fine.」</p>
<p>He already knew that this world was a playground for constellations. Even if it was just a sand castle that was built for a short time on the playground and then collapsed, he wanted to have his own name.</p>
<p>He wanted to be a proper part of the playground.</p>
<p>He wanted to become the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p>—Do you really want to become the 'Demon King of Salvation'?</p>
<p>The 'Dark Keeper' looked up blankly at the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p>—Whatever the cost?</p>
<p>He wants to have a name.</p>
<p>He wants to have a proper role and die after fulfilling it.</p>
<p>The 'Dark Keeper' nodded with all his might.</p>
<p>He's good even if it's just one sentence, so if there's a story given to him.</p>
<p>—Then let’s give it a try.</p>
<p>He wants to write down that story.</p>
<p>[The story 'Demon King of Salvation' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>The cold snow covered him.</p>
<p>「I.」</p>
<p>The dark sentinel soon became one with distant eternity.</p>
<p>「We are the Demon King of salvation.」</p>
<p>His tattered body was once again filled with probability and filled with the story of the constellation.</p>
<p>Tsutsutsutsu!</p>
<p>In the midst of wild sparks, Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation', opened his eyes.</p>
<p>When he lightly tilted his head, his body screamed along with a crunching sound.</p>
<p>A demonic body full of traces of being cut to pieces by Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>Even though no limb was intact, it was important that the plan was successful.</p>
<p>[The constellations of &lt;Asgard&gt; are astonished!]</p>
<p>A plan that was dramatically successful.</p>
<p>This could not have been realized if several probabilities had not been interlocked like cogs.</p>
<p>A giant nebula uttered [fate].</p>
<p>That [fate] was given to him, a narrative-grade constellation, instead of an incarnation.</p>
<p>The probability ran wild due to a calculation error in the twisted [fate].</p>
<p>Under the pretext of extra probability, he was given the right to move to a new body.</p>
<p>Above all, the plan could not have succeeded if it had not been for the help of the demon 'Dark Keeper' who impersonated the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p>[The incarnation body is quiet with your story.]</p>
<p>[The synchronization rate between you and the incarnation body increases.]</p>
<p>Perhaps this will be his last story.</p>
<p>"It’s him! He’s over there!"</p>
<p>The incarnations who sensed his status began to flock to him.</p>
<p>The great constellations belonging to the giant nebula that were chasing Lee Hakhyun just a moment ago.</p>
<p>"W-what is that—"</p>
<p>"Why in a body other than your own incarnation..."</p>
<p>"Could it be that you were trying to protect the incarnation?"</p>
<p>The constellations looked at each other in disbelief.</p>
<p>Someone said with a sly smile.</p>
<p>"They say he’s a fragment of a discarded god, but he’s incredibly stupid."</p>
<p>Stupid.</p>
<p>That was correct.</p>
<p>[The constellations of the nebula &lt;Ghost&gt; shake their heads at your foolishness.]</p>
<p>[The constellations of the nebula &lt;Guardian Tree&gt; are saddened by your choice.]</p>
<p>[The constellations of the nebula &lt;Olympus&gt; laugh at your judgment.]</p>
<p>The body of the resurrected demon species creaked. The word was resurrection, but the body was already dead. An incarnation that can't last even 10 minutes at best.</p>
<p>From afar, the 'Gatekeeper of Thebes' shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"You've finally been caught, Demon King of Salvation! There's nowhere to run now!"</p>
<p>As if victory had already been achieved, the 'Gatekeeper of Thebes' walked towards him with great strides and spoke in a triumphant voice.</p>
<p>"You have no idea how much effort I put into catching you. I persuaded the nebulae one by one…"</p>
<p>Now that [fate] has been declared, it will be difficult to avoid death.</p>
<p>The situation might have been a little better if there had been a story like 'I, the Opponent of Fate', and Cheok Junkyung’s 'The One Who Fights Against Fate', which the 1,865th round of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; had.</p>
<p>But there was no such story.</p>
<p>There were many stories that he does not have today.</p>
<p>「Maybe the youngest will find everything.」</p>
<p>The youngest was a strange guy.</p>
<p>Among the 'Kim Dokjas' he knows, he is the only one who can write.</p>
<p>He was curious at first.</p>
<p>He was curious about what the guy who possessed this petty villain would talk about.</p>
<p>The guy who clumsily imitated 'Kim Dokja' was cute, and he was a little proud of the guy who took care of the things that 'Kim Dokja' didn’t do.</p>
<p>Sometimes he was so frustrated that he wanted to say something.</p>
<p>Still, it was fun to see the story of such a guy.</p>
<p>「But he’s the youngest.」</p>
<p>Maybe that's why he's here now.</p>
<p>「This damned world won’t read the story you wrote.」</p>
<p>The 'Gatekeeper of Thebes', who had been talking for a while, frowned.</p>
<p>"…So, are you listening to my story?"</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation looked at him for a moment and laughed.</p>
<p>Among the tales of the 'Gatekeeper of Thebes', there was the 'final cubic crystal'.</p>
<p>A tale that makes one confess one's desires at the last moment in exchange for raising one's status.</p>
<p>"Uh, go ahead."</p>
<p>While the 'Gatekeeper of Thebes' was talking, the Demon King of Salvation looked through the coat the demon servant was wearing.</p>
<p>There was a cigarette pack in the coat.</p>
<p>As he took out a cigarette, the idea of a guy who liked cigarettes came to mind.</p>
<p>Who was it?</p>
<p>Memories dispersed like smoke. The place where the memories disappeared hurt. That pain immediately proved that he was Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>The 'Gatekeeper of Thebes', who came to his senses belatedly, blushed and shouted.</p>
<p>"Kill him! Retrieve the fragment!"</p>
<p>Incarnations rushing towards him.</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation said, tossing away his cigarette.</p>
<p>"Youngest, let me borrow some weapons."</p>
<p>Silver light flew from somewhere and settled in the right hand of the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p>[The tale 'The One Who is Loved by All Things' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>[The item 'Thoughts of Almost Everything' is suitable for your story.]</p>
<p>In a flash of bright light, one of the incarnations that was running at the front was split in half.</p>
<p>"Kaaaaaaak!"</p>
<p>'Thoughts' mimicked 'Broken Faith'.</p>
<p>'I activate 'Blade of Faith'.</p>
<p>"How can you still—"</p>
<p>The constellations retreated in awe.</p>
<p>The power to kill the incarnation of a great constellation with increased synchronization.</p>
<p>The 'Gatekeeper of Thebes', with his eyes wide open as if torn apart, screamed loudly.</p>
<p>"It’s just a fluke! Keep pushing! Even he’s at his limit!"</p>
<p>The hesitating constellations rushed forward again.</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation swung his sword without hesitation. Cut off their arms, cut off their legs, and slit their throat.</p>
<p>Every time that happened, the wounds on the demon species' body also increased.</p>
<p>「This world is an obvious tragedy.」</p>
<p>He pulled out the arrow stuck in his shoulder and kicked away the spear that grazed his thigh.</p>
<p>「A world created to cause pain to Yoo Joonghyuk.」</p>
<p>The moment he removed the blade aimed at his side, a pain arose in his back. The torn wings of the demon species fluttered across the floor.</p>
<p>「A story marred by big and small failures and never-ending despair. This world was the fate given to Yoo Joonghyuk.」</p>
<p>The moment the torn wing fell to the ground, lightning struck again from the sky.</p>
<p>「Therefore, anyone who tries to share that responsibility will surely be cursed.」</p>
<p>The void curtain fluttered and another star fell into the white shining night sky.</p>
<p>[Some great fate is wishing for your death.]</p>
<p>He is the Demon King of Salvation who cannot feel emotions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, at this moment, he was also Kim Dokja. Maybe it was because I met the youngest.</p>
<p>"Okay. Are you fighting too?"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk couldn’t answer.</p>
<p>Just as the writing on the monitor does not respond.</p>
<p>Some communication never happens. And where communication is impossible, there is just a story.</p>
<p>「The Demon King of Salvation lives to read that story.」</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation smiled like a prisoner accepting a deserved punishment.</p>
