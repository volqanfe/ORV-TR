<hr/>
<p>Forgetting that you are even reading a sentence.</p>
<p>Getting sucked into the story, becoming the main character, and the main character becoming me.</p>
<p>[Your 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' has reached a certain level.]</p>
<p>There is a saying that refers to the magical moment that everyone experiences while reading a book.</p>
<p>[You reach the realm of pendulum experience.]</p>
<p>Pendulum experience.</p>
<p>Beyond the walls of paper and text, recognizing other people's experiences as if they were your own.</p>
<p>[The Void Curtain is looking at you.]</p>
<p>All I have to do is skip to one more chapter.</p>
<p>I had a feeling that there was a next story beyond this that I wanted to see so much.</p>
<p>【■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■You can’t get over it】</p>
<p>At that time, someone grabbed my back.</p>
<p>Just need to go a little further. The story I want is right there.</p>
<p>Then something inside me answered.</p>
<p>【It only takes a moment. Because I’m not really going to pass.】</p>
<p>【No one can defy probability】</p>
<p>Something inside me spoke once again.</p>
<p>【For the sake of this great 'record', please turn a blind eye just once.】</p>
<p>For a moment, time seemed to freeze. It feels like a very distant part of the universe is slowly nodding its head.</p>
<p>A sheet of paper was passed slowly. It's so thick that it takes my breath away. After barely flipping through the paper, I finally found the one sentence I was looking for.</p>
<p>「Yoo Joonghyuk, sitting cross-legged, recalled a memory from a long time ago.」</p>
<p>I started reading the sentence.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, sitting cross-legged, recalled a memory from a long time ago.</p>
<p>It is a journey to retrieve Kim Dokja. Memories of swimming through space with Biyoo. A story from the time when Han Sooyoung's novels were used and their stories were spread throughout the universe.</p>
<p>The arduous journey gradually made Yoo Joonghyuk tired, and he worked harder to forget that he was getting tired.</p>
<p>He had to move.</p>
<p>[Captain, let’s rest here for a moment.]</p>
<p>With Biyoo, he sat on an unfamiliar bench in an unfamiliar place on an unfamiliar planet and looked up at the familiar sky.</p>
<p>Looking at the sky like that, Yoo Joonghyuk felt that the path they had walked was very unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Will they really be able to meet Kim Dokja again at the end of this road? Is that poor guy really alive with them?</p>
<p>[Sometimes you need to rest.]</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk thought about the stars that didn't talk to him. He reminisced about his lost sponsor and imagined another self who had reached his ■■ — 'Secretive Plotter'.</p>
<p>Will a moment like that of 'Secretive Plotter' come to him?</p>
<p>Will there be some kind of salvation at the end of this difficult life?</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk could hardly imagine. His ■■ was as distant as Kim Dokja's now blurred face.</p>
<p>Will he know when this trip is over?</p>
<p>Why was he born, lived, and continues to live in this world?</p>
<p>[Captain, have you ever thought about that?]</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk answered Biyoo's question half a beat late.</p>
<p>"What."</p>
<p>[I think there might be a happy universe in which all these tragedies did not occur.]</p>
<p>Happy universe, Yoo Joonghyuk thought about that strange word for a moment and said.</p>
<p>"If it weren’t for all those tragedies, we wouldn’t be where we are today."</p>
<p>Biyoo pursed her lips as if she hadn't asked that and then added.</p>
<p>[But sometimes you can imagine a different world.]</p>
<p>"What world are you talking about?"</p>
<p>[In that world, there are no scenarios, and the stars don't talk to you. But there is tragedy in that world too.]</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>[The biggest tragedy in that world is oversleeping and being late for school.]</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk silently listened to Biyoo.</p>
<p>[Plus, the lunch menu that day is a tasteless meal. I went to a PC room with the money I spent on supplies and got caught by my parents.]</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk briefly imagined the world described by Biyoo.</p>
<p>However, such a world was not depicted very well.</p>
<p>Because he never went to school properly, never ate lunch without worrying about the taste, and his parents never existed.</p>
<p>"You are the Dokkaebi King now. Why do you miss those things?"</p>
<p>[Why? Can’t I miss it?]</p>
<p>Hearing that question, Yoo Joonghyuk looked back on his old memories. A face suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p>A girl who often smiled brightly. A child who always called him 'Captain' and followed him.</p>
<p>“You were Shin Yoosoung of the 41st Round."</p>
<p>[Well, if you look at the origin, yes.]</p>
<p>"Are you still blaming me?"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk remembered Shin Yoosoung, the 'Disaster of Floods'. She came to the past to change the future, but Shin Yoosoung was disappointed in him. Shin Yoosoung tried to kill him.</p>
<p>He will never forget the look in her eyes.</p>
<p>[No. I can’t even remember those times very well.]</p>
<p>The girl who was reincarnated as a dokkaebi, burying all resentment and hatred, spoke.</p>
<p>As Yoo Joonghyuk watched such a Biyoo, he felt an unknown emotion.</p>
<p>So where does Shin Yoosoung's 41st Round go now? What will now fill the space where all hatred and resentment have disappeared?</p>
<p>As if understanding Yoo Joonghyuk’s doubts, Biyoo spoke.</p>
<p>[It’s not that bad to have gaps in your memory. Because that blank space can be filled with other imagination.]</p>
<p>"In the 41st Round, I did something I couldn’t take back."</p>
<p>[It may have been so. But there weren't only bad things in that Round.]</p>
<p>Biyoo muttered as if retracing the traces of the disappeared 41st Round.</p>
<p>[So, try to imagine as much fun as possible. In fact, there must have been a very cool adventure in the 41st Round. It's just that the Captain, I, and everyone else forgot.]</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>[Do you know? I may have been in school in that Round. The Captain could have come to my graduation ceremony.]</p>
<p>Of course, such a thing could not have been possible, but Biyoo continued.</p>
<p>[Maybe there was a Dokja in that Round as well.]</p>
<p>"It’s impossible."</p>
<p>[I'm just imagining it. Because it’s fun to imagine.]</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk thought about himself in the 41st Round.</p>
<p>He doesn't know how he felt or what he felt during the 41st Round.</p>
<p>Why did he send Shin Yoosoung to the past? What kind of tragedy did he face that made him think that was the only solution?</p>
<p>[It gets serious again. They say have fun imagining things! Don’t you think so?]</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk looked out into the street in silence. The sun set late in the day. Students were seen leaving school as the sunset broke over thread-like stream.</p>
<p>"I won’t."</p>
<p>[Don’t you think the captain will have a dream life too?]</p>
<p>It's the life he dreamed of. If there was such a thing, his life should have been different when the scenario ended.</p>
<p>[Well, if there was such a thing, the captain wouldn't have been unemployed. The captain is also really pitiful.]</p>
<p>"I am neither pitiful nor unemployed."</p>
<p>[That's right. Imagination does that.]</p>
<p>"It’s not my imagination. I’ve always trained with the sword."</p>
<p>[What were you planning on doing with your sword training?]</p>
<p>What were you trying to do by training your sword? Yoo Joonghyuk had nothing to say in response.</p>
<p>There was no longer a Constellation in the sky that he had seen. There was no one who would acknowledge him for training with the sword.</p>
<p>[Did you try to become a kendo player like Heewon-ssi?]</p>
<p>"I don’t plan on doing that."</p>
<p>[Then you are just an unemployed person who is good at using a sword.]</p>
<p>Why did he train with the sword?</p>
<p>The moment when Yoo Joonghyuk, who had been contemplating for a long time, was barely able to come up with an answer. .</p>
<p>"I—"</p>
<p>The voices of boys and girls were heard from below thread-like stream. One girl said, "Let’s go to the PC room!" She shouted, and the other boy frowned. Then the slim, white boy put a headlock on the frowning boy.</p>
<p>"Ah! Let’s go!"</p>
<p>The moment he heard the boy's voice, Yoo Joonghyuk jumped up from his seat.</p>
<p>[Captain?]</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk started going down the hill. The legs that had been moving slowly became faster and faster. Yoo Joonghyuk ran to the boy, forgetting that he was out of breath, and grabbed him by the shoulder.</p>
<p>The boy frowned and looked back at him.</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>"What is it, ahjussi?"</p>
<p>The blunt-looking boy grabbed Yoo Joonghyuk's arm, and as if protecting the boy, the girl frowned menacingly at Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk quickly let go of his hand.</p>
<p>"I’m sorry. I saw wrong."</p>
<p>The boy and girl grumbled slightly and set out on the road again.</p>
<p>Looking at their somewhat unfamiliar yet familiar backs, Yoo Joonghyuk suddenly imagined something like that.</p>
<p>"Maybe that boy."</p>
<p>As Biyoo says, isn't that boy also Kim Dokja, who was reborn after forgetting all his tragedies at the end of his reincarnation?</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk looked at the boy and girl next to him. A blunt boy with a strangely similar vibe to him, and a girl with tear spots like Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p>Of course, those children were neither Yoo Joonghyuk nor Han Sooyoung. Even though he knew this, Yoo Joonghyuk continued to feel strange.</p>
<p>What if there really is a story like that somewhere in this universe?</p>
<p>Biyoo’s voice laughing softly tickled his ears.</p>
<p>[Look at that. Even the Captain has a story he imagines.]</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk slowly opened his eyes and woke up from the turbulent storm of his memories.</p>
<p>Pure white steam rose from his whole body as he sat cross-legged. The wounds from the fierce battle with Odin had turned black.</p>
<p>'I overdid it.'</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk recalled the last fierce battle. Receiving Odin's spear, cutting down the legendary Constellations of &lt;Asgard&gt;, crashing the incarnation into the void curtain, and being swept away by the aftereffects of probability.</p>
<p>If 'Monarch Slayer' Jaehwan had not helped him, he would  have been swept away by the storm of probability and would not have been able to return.</p>
<p>'Monarch Slayer.'</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk thought about Jaehwan. The miracle of rebirth was not felt anywhere in the vicinity. He's a guy who can't catch the original species, so he might be traveling all over the Star Stream again.</p>
<p>'You wasted too much probability. It wasn't a probability to be used here.'</p>
<p>Originally, he planned to save this probability and save it again and then explode it at an important time.</p>
<p>If Kim Dokja's presence had not been felt in 'Washington Dome', he would not have made such a risky choice.</p>
<p>「Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>The moment Yoo Joonghyuk thought of that name, he suddenly felt a familiar feeling.</p>
<p>A feeling that someone is watching him. Yoo Joonghyuk knew what this feeling was.</p>
<p>A unique skill possessed by that guy who only talks about it, that magically appeared whenever and wherever he thought about it.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk reflexively looked up into space.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The moment Yoo Joonghyuk looked at me, I was shocked and changed the screen.</p>
<p>Wow, I’m surprised.</p>
<p>It was really that 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.</p>
<p>I couldn't believe it. I couldn't understand how this was possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if I were to explain it somehow, the situation I was in now was as follows.</p>
<p>「I am the ‘world line’ from [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint]. I crossed the wall.」</p>
<p>A voice from another world line reached my ears, and I followed that voice, crossed the wall of the world line, and came to this place—that is, to the place where 'Yoo Joonghyuk of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;' is.</p>
<p>I don't know what's going on, but just knowing that this happened in reality made my heart race.</p>
<p>What if I could observe other &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; members like I observed Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
<p>No, beyond observation—</p>
<p>「"Dokja ahjussi."」</p>
<p>If only I could tell them my 'story'.</p>
<p>「"Dokja ahjussi."」</p>
<p>If I follow this voice, will I be able to meet the others?</p>
<p>I concentrated once again. Then, my field of vision slowly cleared and a new landscape was revealed.</p>
<p>Somehow, familiar voices were heard in the hazy atmosphere.</p>
<p>"Noona, why isn’t this showing anything?"</p>
<p>"Hmm. Biyoo said it could definitely be seen this way."</p>
<p>"Isn’t the Other Worlds Device broken?"</p>
<p>"Hey! Lee Gilyoung! Don’t kick that!"</p>
<p>"The sooty bastard did this before and it was okay."</p>
<p>"Master, really. Unnie, where is the broadcast area for this?"</p>
<p>"It was the Gourmet Association."</p>
<p>"Shall I come and beat up the Gourmet Association kids?"</p>
<p>"Ah, it’s coming out! The screen is coming out!"</p>
<p>And after a while.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi! It’s him!"</p>
<p>"He really looks just like Dokja ahjussi."</p>
<p>"But the situation doesn’t look good…"</p>
<p>"No, why is that guy passed out over there? Doesn’t someone really have to go help?"</p>
<p>"External Constellations cannot intervene in the Recycling Center."</p>
<p>"But we can’t just leave him like that!"</p>
<p>I suddenly opened my eyes. I saw familiar faces huddled together in front of a small display.</p>
<p>I unconsciously reach out to them...</p>
<p>…I have hands?</p>
<p>I felt sensations all over my body.</p>
<p>How on earth did this happen?</p>
<p>I moved my neck, which was not working well, and checked my hands and feet.</p>
<p>Hands and feet that are unbelievably smaller than mine.</p>
<p>Then a woman with beautiful brown hair turned to me.</p>
<p>In person, the face resembles Ji Eunyu even more.</p>
<p>"kkoma Dokja, are you awake?"</p>
<p>I was suddenly lifted into the air, fully understanding the feelings of Meihouwang, who was held in Ji Eunyu's arms.</p>
<p>"I want to hug him too!"</p>
<p>"You’re awake?"</p>
<p>Two children running. Looking at that scenery, I felt an unknown emotion overflowing with me.</p>
<p>"Shall we watch it together?"</p>
<p>The screen my companions were watching came into view along with a friendly voice. On the screen, there is a fainted figure and Ji Eunyu driving a carriage as well as Cha Yerin .</p>
<p>「"Yerin-ssi. Do you know how to drive?"」</p>
<p>「"I am a minor."」</p>
<p>In a landscape that had no sense of reality, it was only then that I realized what had happened to me.</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' reacts.]</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' is taking a liking to the 'Kim Dokja Fragment' that you possessed.]</p>
<p>Small hands, small feet. A small body that is difficult to get up on its own.</p>
<p>It was definitely true.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint Level 3' is in effect.]</p>
<p>I have become 'kkoma Kim Dokja' raised by Kim Dokja Company.</p>
