<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">687 Episode 23 Fragments of God (2)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>If I really am the reincarnation of 49% Kim Dokja, and therefore have a fragment of Kim Dokja, then there is no way this method would be impossible.</p>
<p>「It feeds me and runs the story.」</p>
<p>If what you want to eat is 'Kim Dokja', I'll eat it as much as you want.</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is looking at you intently.]</p>
<p>Kim Dokja’s voice rang in my head.</p>
<p>—Hey! Wait for a second!</p>
<p>I pretended not to hear him and bit my forearm as hard as I could. I wasn't sure if my actions would lead to predation on stories. But...</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is interested in your story fragment.]</p>
<p>A kind of showmanship to lure the guy.</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' bites off your right arm!]</p>
<p>Tsutsutsutsu!</p>
<p>I felt something like fangs biting into my forearm muscle and a terrible pain.</p>
<p>The blood that spurted into the air soon became sharp pain.</p>
<p>I smiled even through the pain.z</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' feasts on a part of your story!]</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>As I blinked, the scenery of the snowy field fli</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>I don't want to forget ything</p>
<p>Tsutsutsutsutsu.</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is nauseated!]</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>—Is it like this?</p>
<p>I heard Kim Dokja click his tongue in my head.</p>
<p>As if he had foreseen this situation.</p>
<p>The Heir to the Eternal Name who ate my story is in pain.</p>
<p>I was crying.</p>
<p>[The fragment crazy soldier Yoo Joonghyuk refuses to be absorbed!]</p>
<p>[The fragment of the story crazy soldier Yoo Joonghyuk goes on a rampage!]</p>
<p>Crazy soldier?</p>
<p>No, why do I have this fragment?</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is staring at you!]</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' has absorbed the wrong fables.]</p>
<p>[The corresponding 'Story Fragments' cannot be eaten normally.]</p>
<p>[Incomplete predation will result in 10 minutes of extra time!]</p>
<p>[Time remaining until death: 12:59]</p>
<p>Anyway, I bought some time.</p>
<p>[Skill seal penalty is lifted.]</p>
<p>Plus, the penalty is lifted.</p>
<p>I immediately activated 'Blade of Faith' and lightly cut down a few of the attacking creatures.</p>
<p>I heard someone buried in a pile of monsters crying.</p>
<p>Removing the mountains of their corpses, I could see one human hand sticking out.</p>
<p>"Catch it!"</p>
<p>I held her hand and pulled her out with all my might, and the woman was dragged out, shedding tears.</p>
<p>She was crying while holding the dead uncle.</p>
<p>"Go inside, I will block this place."</p>
<p>"But—"</p>
<p>"Hurry!"</p>
<p>The woman quickly nodded her head and ran into the living room.</p>
<p>I piled up the monsters’ corpses to block the entrance to the shelter and then turned around.</p>
<p>In the distance, the battle was still in full swing.</p>
<p>A group led by Bang Cheolsoo and the mother and daughter was continuing the melee nearby, and on the front lines, the siblings Jung Heewon and Jung Eunho were dealing with the dragons together.</p>
<p>—One 5th grade and one 4th grade. Can you do it?</p>
<p>"What does a guy who has been lying down for 45 days do?"</p>
<p>Most incarnations now have as high a level of overall ability as me.</p>
<p>There was no way the situation would change just because I jumped in.</p>
<p>Just hearing the howling of the dragon clan roaring from afar makes my stomach tingle.</p>
<p>In my current physical condition, it would be difficult for me to break through the crowd and enter the front lines.</p>
<p>"Please help me."</p>
<p>—You’re shameless, you bastard.</p>
<p>"Now you have to act like a constellation."</p>
<p>Even if he is not mythical grade, the 'Demon King of Salvation' is a narrative grade one.</p>
<p>A constellation with the highest rank among its class.</p>
<p>"Please give me some coins. Let me increase my stats."</p>
<p>—Where are my coins?</p>
<p>"Why does my constellation not have any coins?"</p>
<p>—If there was such a thing, would you have made a collect call?</p>
<p>Come to think of it, this person was a collect call from the first contact.</p>
<p>I thought it was just because he was a salty idiot, but he really did it because he had no money?</p>
<p>"You had a lot of coins when you were an incarnation, right?"</p>
<p>—Because of you, I spent everything, I don’t even have a few pennies left. Did you forget?</p>
<p>There was a scene that came to mind later.</p>
<p>When I first signed a contract with the 'Demon King of Salvation', I borrowed his story, 'The King of a Kingless World'. Did he pay the probability cost with coins at that time?</p>
<p>"But you only lent me one story..."</p>
<p>—It was my birth story, right?</p>
<p>"Anyway, so you don’t have any coins?"</p>
<p>—I said there isn’t any.</p>
<p>I feel like I want to use [Lie Detection].</p>
<p>"Then what can you do?"</p>
<p>—Well...</p>
<p>Suddenly this thought occurred to me.</p>
<p>What are the advantages of becoming Kim Dokja's incarnation?</p>
<p>If you think about it, didn't Shin Yoosoung, who was the incarnation of Kim Dokja in the main story, grow up on her own without much support?</p>
<p>—Cheering?</p>
<p>I blew off the head of a Grol, who was running at me without a word.</p>
<p>—Hey, you Don’t kill him like that.</p>
<p>"Please don’t talk to me because it will disturb me."</p>
<p>—If you look closely, isn’t there something like an incision on the neck? If you stab it and kill it, you can catch it without much effort. Joonghyuk only realized this after the 40th round…</p>
<p>I stabbed one in the neck as it inadvertently ran towards me.</p>
<p>But did he accidentally stab Kim Dokja in the spot he mentioned?</p>
<p>The grol just went limp without even putting in much effort.</p>
<p>"What about the incision line?"</p>
<p>—There, look carefully! A little further inside!</p>
<p>When I squinted and looked closely, I saw that there were faint incisions on each of the grols’ necks. When the force was adjusted and the shot was fired in a precise trajectory, the group was killed in an instant.</p>
<p>Two, three, four...</p>
<p>Let's kill as many as sixty in less than a minute. The number of nearby groups has decreased significantly.</p>
<p>—How is it?</p>
<p>It's more helpful than I thought.</p>
<p>As expected, knowing 'Ways of Survival' is different.</p>
<p>As they were quickly cleared from the rear, the fierce struggle continued.</p>
<p>The Geumho Station group also seemed to be taking a breather.</p>
<p>"Hyung!"</p>
<p>Bang Cheolsoo found me and waved his hand.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the damage to the Geumho Station Group was not significant yet.</p>
<p>The problem is what to do with those dragons that occupy the center of Gwanghwamun.</p>
<p>[4th grade Earth Dragon species 'Earth Python' roars!]</p>
<p>The people's complexions turned pale as they heard the roar again.</p>
<p>"Everyone cover your ears!"</p>
<p>With Shin Yoosoung's sharp shout, the small Nagak ensemble began at the front.</p>
<p>As the dozen or so Nagak troops poured out their ensemble at once, some of the howling directed at the incarnations was canceled out.</p>
<p>Some Nagaks created a barrier with their shells to block the attack.</p>
<p>However, the small Nagaks are only 8th grade marine species. In the end, the shells that could not endure it burst into pieces.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, who was hiding in one of the shells, stumbled and fell.</p>
<p>"Miss Yoosoung!"</p>
<p>I hurriedly ran over and hugged Shin Yoosoung. When I checked her pulse, I found that her magic circuit was already completely damaged.</p>
<p>I left the fainted Shin Yoosoung in the care of Bang Cheolsoo.</p>
<p>"Hyung?"</p>
<p>Bang Cheolsoo, who accepted Shin Yoosoung with a dumb expression, looked at me.</p>
<p>In the past, I would have never entrusted Shin Yoosoung to this guy.</p>
<p>['Geumho Station Group' unites around the incarnation 'Bang Cheolsoo'.]</p>
<p>But it's different now.</p>
<p>You can tell just by looking at the people at Geumho Station that they still follow him.</p>
<p>"Bang Cheolsoo. No matter what happens, protect her."</p>
<p>"Oh, it’s dangerous to go forward! Let’s run away! While Heewon takes time—"</p>
<p>"Bang Cheolsoo."</p>
<p>Bang Cheolsoo looked at me with trembling eyes and nodded his head with difficulty.</p>
<p>"Yes, I understand."</p>
<p>"It’s a request."</p>
<p>I started running straight to the front line where Jung Heewon was.</p>
<p>There are now 6 minutes left.</p>
<p>Sergeant Kim, carrying the exhausted Jung Eunho, was running away in a huff.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi! You must not come this way!"</p>
<p>Now, the only one guarding the front line was Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon continued to fight against the 4th grade earth dragon species and the 5th grade gold dragon species.</p>
<p>As she activated [Demon Slayer] and [Madness] at the same time, her entire body was filled with incredible energy.</p>
<p>It was like watching Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>But it was clear to anyone that that situation would not last long.</p>
<p>Blood was flowing continuously from her nose and ears.</p>
<p>The dragon tribe also did not take active action, perhaps because they noticed Jung Heewon's condition.</p>
<p>I asked as I slaughtered the monsters blocking the path one by one.</p>
<p>'Do you know the weaknesses of the dragons?'</p>
<p>—I know, but. It's hard to deal with them for you right now with your overall abilities.</p>
<p>'All I have to do is to have high overall stats.'</p>
<p>—Do you have any coins?</p>
<p>I don't know anything else, but there is one thing I am more confident about than other incarnations.</p>
<p>[Coins held: 418,000C]</p>
<p>This time, even Kim Dokja looked surprised.</p>
<p>—What, did you cheat a constellation?</p>
<p>'I did defeat a demon lord.'</p>
<p>Apparently, the 300,000 coins I received from Asmodeus at the theater were big.</p>
<p>That bastard. He probably didn't know that his own money would be put to such good use.</p>
<p>—Then it's time to sell the full profit.</p>
<p>'It’s been a while since I heard that line.'</p>
<p>I opened my wallet without hesitation.</p>
<p>[You invested 24,000 coins in strength.]</p>
<p>[Strength Lv.40 -&gt; Strength Lv.70]</p>
<p>[Your power has attracted the attention of the giants.]</p>
<p>Muscular strength.</p>
<p>[You invested 24,000 coins in stamina.]</p>
<p>[Stamina Lv.40 -&gt; Stamina Lv.70]</p>
<p>[Your physical strength stimulates the curiosity of the heroes.]</p>
<p>Durability.</p>
<p>[You invested 24,000 coins in agility.]</p>
<p>[Agility Lv.40 -&gt; Agility Lv.70]</p>
<p>[The Miao people are amazed at your agility.]</p>
<p>Agility.</p>
<p>[You invested 24,000 coins in magic power.]</p>
<p>[Magic Lv.40 -&gt; Magic Lv.70]</p>
<p>[Your talent has begun to attract the attention of the Magic Tower.]</p>
<p>And even magic power.</p>
<p>[Your overall abilities have almost reached the limit for this scenario.]</p>
<p>As I instantly raised all my abilities to the limit, my whole body began to overflow with vitality.</p>
<p>Even though I was destined to die in 6 minutes, I wasn't afraid at all.</p>
<p>Was I influenced by Kim Dokja?</p>
<p>—Then it looks like we are ready to return to broadcasting.</p>
<p>'Return to broadcast?'</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, I have barely heard any broadcast messages from the moment I woke up.</p>
<p>It was natural.</p>
<p>I signed a sponsorship contract with the 'Demon King of Salvation' and terminated the exclusive contract with Bihyung.</p>
<p>Although I didn't suffer any significant penalty due to Bihyung's consideration, I was no longer of interest to the constellations of the 'Finding Incarnations' group.</p>
<p>This means that I have lost my marketability to the constellations.</p>
<p>—If you spend money, you have to earn back the amount you spent.</p>
<p>I said while dodging the magic wave of the flying Earth Dragon species.</p>
<p>'Now that's a bit difficult. Moreover, my contract with Bihyung has ended—'</p>
<p>—I know. You can do it again.</p>
<p>What am I doing again?</p>
<p>In the first place, the contract between me and Bihyung was possible because I had no sponsor. In the current situation, there was no reason for Bihyung to agree to renew his contract.</p>
<p>It was then that a light spark appeared in the air and a dokkaebi appeared.</p>
<p>[Now, it’s been a while since we’re broadcasting from the Korean Peninsula, constellations!]</p>
<p>Indeed, even dokkaebis will come if you tell them what to do.</p>
<p>Bihyung, who was two times bigger than before, was talking to the constellations, showing off his white and plump belly.</p>
<p>[A few constellations say that the Korean Peninsula channel is no longer interesting.]</p>
<p>[A very small number of constellations are asking whether there are no usable incarnations on the Korean Peninsula channel anymore.]</p>
<p>It was true.</p>
<p>The Korean Peninsula is already in its seventh scenario.</p>
<p>All the incarnations that are strong enough have already signed a sponsorship contract.</p>
<p>But in the midst of all this, there was one idiot who was promoting his own incarnation.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' calls out for you to come see his incarnation!]</p>
<p>It was my cabbage sponsor.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' wonders why no one sees this interesting story.]</p>
<p>I felt a strange sense of déjà vu.</p>
<p>Could it be that Han Sooyoung, who wrote 'Ways of Survival', felt the same way?</p>
<p>'Hey, Kim Dokja-ssi. There's no need to go that far—'</p>
<p>[A very small number of constellations are annoyed, asking why they should look at other people's incarnations.]</p>
<p>[Very few constellations say that their good incarnation was lost to that idiot.]</p>
<p>[A very small number of constellations show hostility to the 'Demon King of Salvation'!]</p>
<p>I didn't want to see my sponsor being criticized anymore.</p>
<p>'As expected, it would be better for you to quit—'</p>
<p>But Kim Dokja’s words continued.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says that incarnation 'Cheon Inho' is not his incarnation, even though it is his incarnation.]</p>
<p>…?</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' declares that the contract he made with his incarnation 'Cheon Inho' is 'temporary'.]</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>I pricked up my ears to understand Kim Dokja's nonsense.</p>
<p>[The incarnation 'Demon King of Salvation' declares that incarnation 'Cheon Inho' will be trained harshly for the next two years and then sent back to the sponsorship contract market!]</p>
<p>[A very small number of constellations are glaring at you, asking how they can believe such a lie.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' swears to the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.]</p>
<p>It was absurd.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask what would happen if I took that kind of oath on my own.</p>
<p>But coo coo coo coo—</p>
<p>Lightning struck in the air.</p>
<p>The sky over the Korean Peninsula was turning red as if a 'Great Hall' had opened.</p>
<p>The light emitted by the constellations temporarily changed the color of the sky.</p>
<p>[Multiple constellations have entered the channel!]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' asks if he has finally awakened.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' picks his ears, saying he has been bored.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' grumbles that the Korean Peninsula channel is still small.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' congratulates you on your return.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is interested in the 'Demon King of Salvation'’s words.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' asks how much he will be sold for in two years.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' sheds tears, saying it has been a while.]</p>
<p>I wondered what on earth was happening. The incarnations and even the dragons were startled and stopped moving.</p>
<p>But that wasn't the end.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' has signed a 'stream contract' with the dokkaebi 'Bihyung'.]</p>
<p>What on earth have you done to already renew my contract?</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' has modified the terms of contract conditions.]</p>
<p>Contract conditions.</p>
<p>Belatedly, I remembered the details of the contract I had signed.</p>
<p>'Bihyung' in this round is a formidable guy. He agreed to a donation distribution ratio of 7 to 3.</p>
<p>Since this is a contract renewal, these conditions are bound to become more unfavorable—</p>
<p>[The donation distribution conditions have been modified to 10 to 0.]</p>
