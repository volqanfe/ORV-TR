<hr/>
<p>"Dokja-ssi."</p>
<p>When I looked up, Jung Heewon was shaking her head, still holding my wrist.</p>
<p>"Even for you, Dokja-ssi, this is unacceptable."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon's eyes were filled with determination. She had already sensed what I was thinking.</p>
<p>"If we leave this tree alone, Murim will be destroyed."</p>
<p>The sub-scenario's core objective was to eradicate the 'Impossible Justice', a Natural Eisaster-level Fear. And to do so, I had to cut down this giant tree before me.</p>
<p>"It's Master."</p>
<p>As if responding to Jung Heewon's words, the tree spewed out a story.</p>
<p>「"Will you become my disciple? Then take this sword."」</p>
<p>Jung Heewon grabbed the sword. In her trembling grip, the swordplay of Mikazuchi Munechika trembled.</p>
<p>A blade sharpened, imbued with the power of D-Coins.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon turned on me with the blade that had protected me until now.</p>
<p>[Natural Disaster-level Fear, 'Impossible Justice', smiles brightly at you.]</p>
<p>I calmly met her eyes, trembling with anxiety.</p>
<p>「This was Jung Heewon's justice.」</p>
<p>Was her justice forced by this forest, or did she realize it herself?</p>
<p>"Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p>I took a step toward her, and she took a step back.</p>
<p>"Don't come near me."</p>
<p>"This tree is not the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint."</p>
<p>I looked up at the tree. I gazed at the branches that stretched out toward the sky, their ends seemingly endless.</p>
<p>"This tree—"</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the history of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was imbued within this tree. But can we truly say that the very collection of histories constitutes that very existence?</p>
<p>Her soul had blossomed completely into Fear, and she was no longer here.</p>
<p>What remained here now was the history of Yoo Joonghyuk, learned and mastered through the [Clear Mirror Vision] over the years—the sorrow endured by the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint of all world lines.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Friend of All Narratives', trembles painfully.]</p>
<p>With a feeling of dizziness, the stories she had experienced jumbled together in my ears.</p>
<p>Some knowledge is hell.</p>
<p>The forest, humans, Murim, her disciple, Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>For a moment, in a state of Fear that felt like my head was going to burst, I gasped for breath and barely managed to finish speaking.</p>
<p>"It is I."</p>
<p>Perhaps my brother had already anticipated this moment.</p>
<p>He in the Snowfield, who hated me becoming Kim Dokja, who wished to be reborn as something other than Kim Dokja, may have been preparing this space—this Fear—for me.</p>
<p>My brother was speaking. The end we seek after such a gruesome struggle is nothing more than a giant tree.</p>
<p>「Can you cut this time?」</p>
<p>There lay the history of Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's fight to protect her disciple.</p>
<p>The Master's struggle to lighten his burden, even if she couldn't return with her disciple.</p>
<p>「"Next time, try this method."」</p>
<p>As the Rounds continued, the Master's words continued.</p>
<p>「"You don't have to obsess over the sword. You have your own speed, so training other martial arts might also be a solution. In that sense, in this Round..."」</p>
<p>She sacrificed her own life.</p>
<p>「"Based on the enlightenment you imparted, I modified the moves of [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship]."」</p>
<p>She strengthened Yoo Jonghyuk in the next Round.</p>
<p>But even that help had its limits. At some point, her disciple's growth surpassed her own capabilities. Breaking the Sky Sword Saint ultimately realized that what she could offer him wasn't her talent or her martial arts prowess.</p>
<p>「Impossible Justice.」</p>
<p>It was her spirit.</p>
<p>A will that would not break no matter how many times it was shattered.</p>
<p>Even amidst human persecution, she never knelt, but looked up to the heavens, and ultimately challenged the authority of the Constellations.</p>
<p>「"Disciple. Don't lose your faith."」</p>
<p>What percentage of Kim Dokjas must gather to become a complete Kim Dokja?</p>
<p>I don't know the answer. Breaking the Sky Sword Saint likely didn't know either.</p>
<p>「"I will die again. The things that are precious to you will leave you time and time again."」</p>
<p>Instead, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint silently counted the years her disciple had lived.</p>
<p>「"Don't lose your smile. Don't forget the taste of Murim dumplings."」</p>
<p>My brother must have read this story before me.</p>
<p>「"In every Round, there were people who loved you. Even if one day you forget everything, even if you despair over the scenarios and give up on life, don't forget that even for you, there were definitely people who loved you."」</p>
<p>This story must have made him sad, despair, and sigh.</p>
<p>「"In those moments when the pressure is too much and you crumble, it's okay to give up. It's okay to put aside what's precious to you for a moment, to throw everything away and run away. That's okay. You deserve it. Because only you have the chance to save this world, only you deserve to give it up."」</p>
<p>And he told me this story.</p>
<p>「"When your wandering ends, come find me in the next round. Then I will accept you as my disciple. Life will begin again, as if nothing had happened, as if no tragedy had ever occurred. And so, spring will pass, summer will pass, fall will pass, and winter will pass. Disciple, live like that. Even if the scenarios never end, even if you can never escape that curse—"」</p>
<p>Snowfield Kim Dokja was asking. Can you destroy this, and reach the scenario's conclusion with your own flesh and blood, imbued with this story?</p>
<p>「"You are someone's hope simply by being alive."」</p>
<p>Blood seemed to flow from my skin where it touched the tree.</p>
<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," Jung Heewon said.</p>
<p>I looked at Jung Heewon and replied.</p>
<p>"Yes. I don't have the confidence to explain it either."</p>
<p>I now consider this tree 'me'. How could I fully convey such a crazy thought to Jung Heewon?</p>
<p>"You don't have to try to explain it. I won't understand anyway. I'm not Dokja-ssi."</p>
<p>[The story, 'Disciple of Breaking the Sky Sword Saint', begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>"So I will stop Dokja-ssi."</p>
<p>The aura emanating from her body grew stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>This was the true effect of this 'forest'. A forest that empowered those who carried out their own agenda.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon's [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship] was evolving in real time.</p>
<p>"Heewon-ssi, you're currently being consumed by the effects of 'Fear'."</p>
<p>"I'm only trying to protect my master."</p>
<p>"That tree isn't the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint."</p>
<p>"I can sense my master's story. This tree is her."</p>
<p>"If Heewon-ssi protects that tree, people will die."</p>
<p>"They deserve to die."</p>
<p>"I know you're not serious."</p>
<p>"No, I'm serious."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon continued, her voice filled with determination.</p>
<p>"Dokja-ssi, I'm not driven by grand ethics or morals. Of course, I don't want to be a crazy murderer. But..."</p>
<p>Not all justices can be as fair and impartial as the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. No, perhaps such a fair and impartial justice might actually be far removed from a humane one.</p>
<p>"There are things more precious to me than those nameless people. People who are precious to me. Protecting them is more important to me."</p>
<p>In that sense, Jung Heewon's current justice was more humane than anyone else's.</p>
<p>Protecting the precious people before her.</p>
<p>That justice also resembled Kim Dok-ja's. To carry out that small justice, Kim Dokja ultimately had to break into countless pieces.</p>
<p>So, as a member of Kim Dokja, shouldn't I also have something to say?</p>
<p>"Is that so?"</p>
<p>This justice is firm. Therefore, it must never be shaken by cowardly means like [Incite].</p>
<p>"Dokja-ssi?"</p>
<p>"If that's truly your resolve."</p>
<p>With each step I took, Jung Heewon's sword trembled.</p>
<p>"I will accept it."</p>
<p>She hesitated and backed away as I approached without hesitation.</p>
<p>"If you come any closer—"</p>
<p>I gripped her cold blade with my hand. And then, thrusting it straight into my heart.</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, who had cried out hysterically, belatedly withdrew her sword.</p>
<p>[Character 'Jung Heewon's' special effect activates.]</p>
<p>[Character 'Jung Heewon' is consumed by 'madness.']</p>
<p>Stories were leaking from my chest, where the sword had pierced it. Jung Heewon, who had been blankly watching, screamed and approached.</p>
<p>"Dokja-ssi! Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay?"</p>
<p>Jung Heewon repeatedly asked if I was okay, like a madman. I grabbed her shoulder and tried to calm her down.</p>
<p>"Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p>"Bleeding. You're bleeding. It keeps bleeding."</p>
<p>The tip of my chest was slightly pricked, but since I quickly retrieved the sword, it wasn't a deep wound.</p>
<p>I held her shoulders more firmly with both hands and reassured her.</p>
<p>"It's okay."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon's eyes continued to waver.</p>
<p>"I, I..."</p>
<p>"Heewon-ssi didn't stab me."</p>
<p>「"There are things more precious to me than those nameless people. People who are precious to me. Protecting those people is more important to me."」</p>
<p>That was Jung Heewon's justice.</p>
<p>And I truly believed it.</p>
<p>"And I won't cut down this tree."</p>
<p>"...Huh?"</p>
<p>"Actually, I think Heewon-ssi is right."</p>
<p>This tree was definitely not Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. Yet, it was clearly part of Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.</p>
<p>"There's someone who absolutely must see this tree."</p>
<p>The only being in this universe capable of defying time. Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's memories had to be passed on to him. He had to know how long she had endured, what kind of life she had endured, and what she wanted to give him.</p>
<p>[The Natural Disaster Fear, 'Impossible Justice' responds to your justice.]</p>
<p>"But before that, there's something I have to take care of first."</p>
<p>I said, letting the stories welling up in my chest scatter into the air.</p>
<p>"Why don't you stop watching and come out? My head's been spinning from all that whining."</p>
<p>With my words, light shone from the tips of the branches of a distant tree. It flashed.</p>
<p>A dozen or so Constellations slowly descended from the sky, accompanied by a hair-raising sensation.</p>
<p>[I can't believe it. Is there really a story with such a scent?]</p>
<p>[He was right. I never thought he'd find his way here.]</p>
<p>[Is that guy really that 'being'?]</p>
<p>A mantra murmured, and at the center of that mantra stood two mighty, silent Constellations.</p>
<p>One was a tall, handsome Constellation with a bright, artificial sun overhead, and the other two were Constellations covered in rough wolf skins.</p>
<p>The two Constellations, feeding on the flesh and blood of my brother, were finally on the verge of reaching the level of Mythical Constellations.</p>
<p>"Apollo, the Omnipotent Sun. Vidar, the Terminator of War."</p>
<p>Facing me, Apollo spoke.</p>
<p>[We've finally met, 'Fragment of Discarded Dreams'.]</p>
<p>"Did you bring 'Breaking the Sky Sword Saint' to this state?"</p>
<p>[She was the one who chose it. We merely granted the mortal's wish to form a forest of her own.]</p>
<p>The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint tree must be growing in real time even now. The tree that devoured &lt;Tamra Heavy Industry&gt; will soon devour all the incarnations, forming a single forest of its own.</p>
<p>Thus, this tree will alone become 'Murim'.</p>
<p>"Do you plan to collect all the D-Coins scattered throughout the city at once through Breaking the Sky Sword Saint?"</p>
<p>Instead of answering, the Constellations remained silent. Observing their expressions, I asked again.</p>
<p>"Did my brother tell you to wait here?"</p>
<p>[Brother?]</p>
<p>A strange mockery flickered across Apollo's face.</p>
<p>[Do you think you can dare impersonate his brother?]</p>
<p>"And yet, you can't take your eyes off the story I've been telling you."</p>
<p>I haven't fully recovered from my 'King of Fear' power yet. They were too numerous for me to fight them using only my 'Demon King of Salvation' mode.</p>
<p>That's why I deliberately got stabbed by Jung Heewon's swordsmanship and let out a story.</p>
<p>If only I could divert the attention of the Constellations for a moment longer.</p>
<p>"Answer my question, and I'll even spare you a finger."</p>
<p>[You arrogant brat.]</p>
<p>"Why, of all times, did you make the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint out of wood? Was this also something my brother ordered?"</p>
<p>[Fragment of a discarded dream, it's beyond your imagination.]</p>
<p>But the Constellations, seemingly unwilling to give me time, refused to answer and began to surround us.</p>
<p>[Subdue them.]</p>
<p>I pushed back the still-half-conscious Jung Heewon and raised my voice.</p>
<p>「Why did they have to make Breaking the Sky Sword Saint out of 'wood' now?」</p>
<p>It could have been done simply to collect the city's D-Coins, or perhaps to lure me. But even that didn't quite add up.</p>
<p>「Why did it have to be 'now'?」</p>
<p>If they were simply targeting me or planning to hoard D-Coins, they had plenty of opportunities before.</p>
<p>But they had waited eight years, and only after I showed up did they put their plan into action.</p>
<p>Eight years.</p>
<p>A thought suddenly occurred to me.</p>
<p>「"You will prosper the city until my brother arrives here. And thus, you will prepare the final story of the &lt;Star Stream&gt;."」</p>
<p>Snowfield Kim Dokj said. The final story of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; would be completed through this city.</p>
<p>What came to mind was the words of Moral I'd encountered in the 'Archive'.</p>
<p>「【'Ragnarok' will soon begin.】」</p>
<p>I knew what 'Ragnarok' was.</p>
<p>A grand narrative and scenario of destruction for &lt;Asgard&gt;. A fateful twilight that signified the end of the gods.</p>
<p>「The World Tree will tremble, all trees will scream, and the Serpent of Twilight will devour their roots.」</p>
<p>Once 'Ragnarok' begins, all of Asgard will be engulfed in the flames of Musheim. Then, even Yggdrasil, the World Tree that forms the foundation of &lt;Asgard&gt;, will be consumed by the flames.</p>
<p>"You, could it be—"</p>
<p>Yet, just before that great apocalypse, a new tree was growing here.</p>
<p>A tree formed from the memories of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, imposing the dream of peace upon the entire world.</p>
<p>"Are you planning to create the next 'World Tree' here?"</p>
<p>The Constellations held back their laughter.</p>
