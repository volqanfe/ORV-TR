<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">808 Episode 39 Rumor (7)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>I felt anxious. If the 'comments' I just saw were true, something terrible would happen to Yoo Joonghyuk from now on.</p>
<p>Surprised by the disappearance of Yoo Joonghyuk, who was escorted with me, I hurriedly ordered someone to search the area.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk!"</p>
<p>I called Yoo Joonghyuk's name several times.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk could die. No, maybe he's already dead. If that happens-</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk?"</p>
<p>And after a while, the guy's head appeared between the crowd.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, who appeared with one of his escorts, was glaring at me with his characteristically sullen eyes.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"No, what if you suddenly disappear like that?"</p>
<p>"There were some Murim dumplings nearby."</p>
<p>When I looked closely, I saw a small dumpling in the guy's mouth.</p>
<p>No, really, because of that?</p>
<p>"This restaurant's Murim dumplings have inherited some of the original recipes. It's my favorite restaurant."</p>
<p>In the main story, Yoo Joonghyuk disappeared because of dumplings.</p>
<p>The reason Yoo Joonghyuk eats Murim dumplings every time he visits Murim is probably because of his memories of Breaking The Sky Sword Saint.</p>
<p>Every time he swallows one of those dumplings, Yoo Joonghyuk must be constantly reminiscing about those days.</p>
<p>In short, that ritual is a necessary procedure for Yoo Joonghyuk to live while remembering the past rounds.</p>
<p>"Even if you look at it that way, I don't think I'll give it to you."</p>
<p>"I won't eat it."</p>
<p>I don't know. It seems like he just eats because he has to eat eight meals.</p>
<p>The guards guarding him also seemed somewhat surprised at the sight of little Yoo Joonghyuk eating. It made sense since he was eating two dumplings in one bite.</p>
<p>"Yoo  Joonghyuk, it's difficult if you disappear like that so suddenly."</p>
<p>It was clear what they were thinking just from the looks the guards exchanged.</p>
<p>「Is that guy really a disciple of Breaking The Sky Sword Saint?"」</p>
<p>After a while, we arrived at Cheongryongseong Square. In the center of the square, a huge banner with the words '191st Fear Expedition' was fluttering.</p>
<p>[The main scenario area is nearby.]</p>
<p>The Namgung Sega's unmanned personnel pointed to the entrance of the venue and said.</p>
<p>"The head of the family is waiting inside."</p>
<p>The inside of the venue was already crowded with people. Participants in the 'Fear Expedition'. And the incarnations who came to see them off or watch them.</p>
<p>"The leader of this expedition is from Namgung Sega?"</p>
<p>"So the leader of the expedition is Namgung Myoung, the head of the small family?"</p>
<p>"That's the rumor. How could that be? There's no way that a promising star of Sega would participate in a scenario where they're going to die..."</p>
<p>I tried to ignore the ominous words. In any case, entering the 'main scenario' was the priority right now.</p>
<p>We stepped into the venue without hesitation. To be exact, that was what we were going to do.</p>
<p>[You are not allowed to enter the 'event venue'.]</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>[You are an 'exile'.]</p>
<p>[You are not allowed to enter the venue without proof of identity.]</p>
<p>It was a disconcerting message.</p>
<p>It's not another scenario, but 'proof of identity' is required for the 'Fear Expedition'?</p>
<p>Did they find the spark flowing through my body? I saw the gatekeepers guarding the venue running towards me.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the guards of Namgung Sega came forward.</p>
<p>"Step back. He is a distinguished guest of Namgung Sega. The guards were ordered by the Sega family to allow him to participate in the competition!"</p>
<p>The guards did not back down easily despite the threats of the guards.</p>
<p>"Even if he is a guest of Namgung Sega, we cannot allow 'exiles' in. That is the rules of the venue."</p>
<p>I realized once again how exiles are treated in the 'scenario area'.</p>
<p>"Can Namgung guarantee that this person is not an extremely evil criminal?"</p>
<p>"Even if you are a criminal, you know that you can participate in the 'Fear Expedition' if you have the permission of the Five Great Segae, right?”</p>
<p>"If the target is an 'exile', then it’s a little different. If an exile has flowed in here, then he is definitely not an ordinary being. What if he is a great villain who has incurred the wrath of the Constellations?"</p>
<p>The gatekeepers, who were glaring at me with sharp eyes, showed no sign of yielding.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a shout was heard from inside the hall.</p>
<p>"The inaugural speech has begun!"</p>
<p>If this were to continue, I would miss all the scenario participation orders.</p>
<p>I quickly nodded to Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>—Go in first.</p>
<p>—Then you...</p>
<p>—I’ll find a way to get in somehow. You should go in first and get a feel for the atmosphere inside the hall.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, who had been thinking for a moment, nodded.</p>
<p>—Don’t be late.</p>
<p>Following that, the Namgung Segae’s warriors bowed to me and disappeared into the hall with Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>One of them said to me,</p>
<p>"I will inform the lord of the situation. Please wait a moment."</p>
<p>I nodded, but I felt strange inside.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Emperor Sword Namgung Jincheon had not anticipated this situation?</p>
<p>In the first place, the 'Gongpyeongyeong Expedition' was an event that he and the Five Great Sega had planned together.</p>
<p>But he knew that I was an 'Exiled One', yet he couldn't prevent my entry control in advance?</p>
<p>Suddenly, I had a bad feeling.</p>
<p>What if the Emperor Sword's purpose was to separate me and Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
<p>[You are an 'Exiled One'.]</p>
<p>[You cannot enter the venue without proof of identity.]</p>
<p>I shook my head vigorously.</p>
<p>Even if it was a trap, there was nothing I could do. Even the incarnation that the god had fixed wouldn't last long. It would be a waste of time to wander around looking for another 'main scenario' now.</p>
<p>I had to find a way to enter the venue.</p>
<p>"Is there no way for the Exiled One to enter?"</p>
<p>The gatekeepers looked at each other as if they were troubled by my question, and answered in a somewhat sharp voice.</p>
<p>"If there is a Constellation that can vouch for you, an exile."</p>
<p>Constellation?</p>
<p>Judging from the expressions on the gatekeepers' faces, they seemed to think there would be no Constellation that could vouch for me.</p>
<p>A Constellation's vouch.</p>
<p>I looked up at the pale sky and thought of Constellations that could help me. There were modifiers that came to mind, but I wasn't sure if they would see me, who had been kicked out of the scenario.</p>
<p>In addition, most of the Constellations in that sky were hostile to me. If they knew I was here, there would be more of them who would come down to kill me, not to mention vouch for me.</p>
<p>However, I couldn't delay any longer.</p>
<p>I had to enter the stadium using [Incite] or some other trick.</p>
<p>Finally, I made up my mind and was about to activate [Incite].</p>
<p>"Those guys—"</p>
<p>The entrance to the stadium was tumultuous. It was a crowd of unmanned people who had just started to enter. They seemed to be martial artists from the old village.</p>
<p>"I'm looking forward to this expedition."</p>
<p>"Is 'that' going to go too?"</p>
<p>"Wow, is it the old days? Well, this is a chance to restore the status of the fallen sect."</p>
<p>I watched the martial artists wearing splendid robes as they entered. Judging from their attire, they seemed to be masters of the Jeongpa.</p>
<p>"It's Shaolin!"</p>
<p>"There's a Shaman too!"</p>
<p>Shaolin, Hwasan, Shaman... Masters of sects I'd only heard of through rumors were entering the competition hall one by one.</p>
<p>But at the end of the line, there was a man in a familiar outfit.</p>
<p>At first, I couldn't tell who he was. But when I looked at him once, twice, three times, I vaguely knew who he was.</p>
<p>His face was different, but it was unmistakable.</p>
<p>More than anything, the story inside me was testifying to him.</p>
<p>At that moment, a middle-aged man who recognized me opened his eyes wide and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"You are..."</p>
<p>There was.</p>
<p>In this desolate First Murim, the one and only Constellation that would guarantee my identity.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[You have entered the new 'Main Scenario' area.]</p>
<p>[The 'Exile Penalty' is removed.]</p>
<p>[The new 'Main Scenario' has arrived!]</p>
<p>The air of the 'Scenario' has finally returned.</p>
<p>I was moved anew as I felt the refreshing breath of the story. This was the feeling of being alive—the feeling of clearly standing on my feet and living in the story.</p>
<p>I wanted to check the scenario content right away, but I had to express my gratitude first.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much."</p>
<p>The middle-aged man who waved his hand with a friendly smile on his face. The story inside me reacted again.</p>
<p>[The story 'persistent martial arts master' shivers in joy.]</p>
<p>The middle-aged man who sensed the story nodded as if he was impressed.</p>
<p>[It seems it is listening to you now.]</p>
<p>"You have been very helpful."</p>
<p>The 「Persistent Martial Arts Master」 was once this middle-aged man's story.</p>
<p>"This is the first time we met since Seoul Station."</p>
<p>He was the former head of Seoul Station, and the 'Last Ark' of the Beggar Sect, the Constellation.</p>
<p>The Dragon's Head Ark 'Cheongae'.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Last Ark' expresses its joy to you.]</p>
<p>The events that happened at Seoul Station flashed through my mind like a panorama.</p>
<p>A Constellation that wanted to step down from being a Constellation and start the 'scenarios' from the beginning again.</p>
<p>That Constellation, along with its incarnation, appeared before my eyes.</p>
<p>[Your divine power has been revealed.]</p>
<p>"It's thanks to you."</p>
<p>He said that, but in fact, the feeling I got from Cheongae wasn't as good as before.</p>
<p>That was natural.</p>
<p>At that time, Cheongae was caught up in the aftermath of the probability related to the 'God of the Other World' and paid a huge price.</p>
<p>"It seems you've been through a lot without me knowing."</p>
<p>I answered with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Perhaps Cheongae and I were in a position to understand each other better than anyone else right now.</p>
<p>In a sense, we were both 'fallen Constellations'.</p>
<p>"Didn't the Ark come to participate in this scenario?"</p>
<p>"I said so, to keep the agreement of the Beggar Sect. I came back to where I have an agreement to keep."</p>
<p>Cheongae, who was once one of the best in the 'First Murim', was pushed out of Murim after losing to 'Paradox Baekcheong' and 'Breaking The Sky Sword Saint' in succession.</p>
<p>"I have decided to rewrite the history of my heaven from here. In the world where I fell and escaped."</p>
<p>"You have made a big decision."</p>
<p>A decision that only a Constellation who has acknowledged his own failure can make. Nevertheless, his expression was brighter than ever.</p>
<p>"I thought that in order to understand my opponents, I needed to know the trials they overcame."</p>
<p>"So you participated in the 'Gonghoryeong Expedition'?"</p>
<p>After hearing the explanation, I understood why he had no choice but to participate in this expedition.</p>
<p>「Gonghoryeong is the cradle and grave of the Transcendents.」</p>
<p>That 'Gonghoryeong' was the only entrance to the 'Dark Dimension' in this Murim. And the Transcendents known in Murim were mostly from that 'Dark Dimension'.</p>
<p>The same goes for the Paradoxical Baekcheong Kyrgios Rodgraim and the Breaking The Sky Sword Saint Namgung Minyoung.</p>
<p>"That's right. By the way, since you came all the way here, I guess your circumstances are also difficult."</p>
<p>He seemed to have guessed why I had participated in the 'Fear Realm Expedition'.</p>
<p>"There are many Constellations that support you, including me."</p>
<p>"That's something to be thankful for."</p>
<p>"Of course, there are more Constellations that want to kill you."</p>
<p>I replied with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>"I've heard the general rumor. That you defeated all the Zodiac Signs at the 'Recycling Center'."</p>
<p>"It seems a bit exaggerated."</p>
<p>"I also heard that you summoned Outer Gods with just your three-inch tongue and had a big fight with the Constellations."</p>
<p>Those 'Outer Gods' were probably from &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;.</p>
<p>But they weren't called by me; they just came looking for me.</p>
<p>"I also heard that you poked holes in the stomachs of the Constellations that were obsessed with you."</p>
<p>And it wasn't me who did it, it was the stabbing monster, Jaehwan...</p>
<p>"You made a resolution with the naked man who shouted destruction….."</p>
<p>That's right, we went together…</p>
<p>"When I heard that you summoned the Archangels and Demon Kings and tried to recreate the 'Holy Demon War' and destroy the &lt;Star Stream&gt;… I was really shocked."</p>
<p>Some strange rumor is spreading.</p>
