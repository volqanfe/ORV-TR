<hr/>
<p>「"You're useless."」</p>
<p>A sentence came into my mind.</p>
<p>「"If I take you with me, isn't it just a food bug?"」</p>
<p>「"Let’s send you to the dungeon. If you survive and come back, we’ll accept you in the group."」</p>
<p>I don't know if this is a sentence from 'Ways of Survival' or the voice that comes from within Shin Yoosoung. What is certain is that Shin Yoosoung, who is shouting from afar, is gradually losing her confidence.</p>
<p>"Don't listen to other people!"</p>
<p>No matter what I do now, I cannot change the history that has already been written for that child.</p>
<p>Even if I delete a sentence that has already been read once, it will not be deleted.</p>
<p>What I can do is to write the next sentence that the child will read darker and clearer.</p>
<p>[The attribute effect activates!]</p>
<p>And in that case, I was more confident than anyone else.</p>
<p>"You can do whatever you want! You don't have to kill monsters! If you think you can be friends, believe it!"</p>
<p>This world will not be as easy as the sentence I wrote.</p>
<p>There are monsters you can't be friends with, and monsters you can't tame.</p>
<p>Even a monster whose goal is to destroy this world like the 'last dragon of the Apocalypse'.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>"It's okay to fail!"</p>
<p>What was in front of Shin Yoosoung now were 'Nagaks'.</p>
<p>Just because the cruel truth of the world exists in a faraway place, there is no need to trample even the smallest hope in front of you.</p>
<p>Nagaks can be tamed.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung can do it.</p>
<p>"I'll buy you time, so try slowly again and again!"</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.9' is strongly activated!]</p>
<p>A whopping level 9 [Incite].</p>
<p>After obtaining the first story, my [Incite] became much stronger than before.</p>
<p>[The person's talent is temporarily enhanced by 'Strong Incitement'.]</p>
<p>I tried to help Shin Yoosoung [Tame] with my support. How much time passed?</p>
<p>A thread made of light flowed from Shin Yoosoung's fingertips, and was soon connected to a Nagak.</p>
<p>[Character 'Shin Yoosoung' succeeded in taming a 'Nagak'!]</p>
<p>As if she couldn't believe what she had done, Shin Yoosoung widened her eyes.</p>
<p>"Good job! Continue!"</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, who exchanged glances with me, nodded her head with a slightly confident face.</p>
<p>I avoided the Nagak's ensemble attack, and when I thought there was no place to escape, I hid myself using Nagak's shell.</p>
<p>Doo doo doo!</p>
<p>This attack was also easy to avoid because I memorized the pattern.</p>
<p>As Kim Dokja said, there is a breaking law in every scenario.</p>
<p>[Character 'Shin Yoosoung' succeeded in taming a 'Nagak'!]</p>
<p>[Character 'Shin Yoosoung' succeeded in taming a 'Nagak'!]</p>
<p>In the meantime, Shin Yoosoung was steadily taming Nagaks.</p>
<p>I was just dragging time like this.</p>
<p>But there was one problem.</p>
<p>[The 6th-grade sea species 'Ancient Nagak' shows strange movements.]</p>
<p>The 'Ancient Nagak' was watching Shin Yoosoung repeat [taming].</p>
<p>"Hide!"</p>
<p>Surprised, Shin Yoosoung quickly dived into the shell of the Nagak without breathing.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the ensemble attack of the 'Ancient Nagak' swept near the Nagak where Shin Yoosoung was hiding.</p>
<p>[6th-grade sea species 'Ancient Nagak' is indignant!]</p>
<p>After staying in the puddle all the way, he moved a heavy note for the first time. The claws caught on its long legs rolled across the terrarium floor.</p>
<p>It moved its long, tall legs to crush the dead bodies of Nagak one by one.</p>
<p>Kwajik!</p>
<p>Even without the ensemble, the Ancient Nagak’s physical ability was quite threatening.</p>
<p>I guess so.</p>
<p>If it's 6th-grade sea species, it's a monster on the same level as the 'Titano' that Lee Gilyoung tamed.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' makes a sad face.]</p>
<p>I lightly loosened my wrists and activated the [White and Blue Steel].</p>
<p>['Blade of Faith' is activated!]</p>
<p>With a gigiing sound, a blue blade rose from the Broken Faith.</p>
<p>I couldn't break its shell with the 'Blade of Faith' made with my magical power.</p>
<p>But what about its legs?</p>
<p>I ran toward it in a straight line and immediately swung the 'Blade of Faith'.</p>
<p>[Story 'The tenacious Murim master' speaks hesitantly]</p>
<p>The historical level story received from the ark.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Ark's [Bong method] came into my mind, and the familiar movement of the Ark entered my fingertips in a story.</p>
<p>The strangely sluggish and awkward movements changed to those of a top-notch master the moment the story</p>
<p>Sugak!</p>
<p>The blow didn't cut it off, but the Ancient Nagak’s leg was cut in half.</p>
<p>It stumbled and screamed in pain.</p>
<p>I realized how amazing the skills of the Murim people are.</p>
<p>Humans who polished a single skill again and again.</p>
<p>I suddenly became curious.</p>
<p>The people stronger than the ark, what kind of training did the pajeon swordsman and Kyrgios go through to reach such a level? What kind of scenery is the world they see?</p>
<p>「I want to see and write all those stories.」</p>
<p>I swung my sword again. One of its legs was completely cut off and it rolled on the floor.</p>
<p>I was awakened by the sound, resounding like a bloody spirit. When the sea species mouth was released, I was already covered in the blood of a marine species.</p>
<p>[6th-grade marine species prepares for the Ancient Nagak’s 'single ensemble'!]</p>
<p>The guy who sucked in his breath in an instant prepared to emit sound waves.</p>
<p>Almost reflexively, I fell on my stomach, covering myself with the shells around me.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>I couldn't hear its ensemble.</p>
<p>Moments later, a hole opened through the top of the shell with a sound like a crushing sound. The antennae of the guy, visible through the broken back, were hoarding at me as if mocking me.</p>
<p>[The 6th-grade sea species, the Ancient Nagak, starts this short ensemble!]</p>
<p>It was too late to avoid it.</p>
<p>The shell no longer served as a protective film.</p>
<p>It had been aiming only for this moment all along.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi!"</p>
<p>I saw Shin Yoosoung screaming at me from afar.</p>
<p>Nagak’s grass flute was raised and spread.</p>
<p>「I’m going to die.」</p>
<p>If I die now.</p>
<p>「Shin Yoosoung will also die.」</p>
<p>It can't be like that.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.9' is activated!]</p>
<p>"I am a 'Nagak'."</p>
<p>Perhaps it was momentarily confused by my [Incite]. However, some of the sound waves apparently flowed through the cracks in the shell and crashed into my eardrums.</p>
<p>My head spun around with a gigiing sound.</p>
<p>I was bleeding from my ear, but fortunately it was an internal injury that I could deal with.</p>
<p>"It's okay! Go ahead!"</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung confirmed my state and nodded her head with a relieved expression.</p>
<p>[Character 'Shin Yoosoung' succeeded in taming a 'Nagak'!]</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the influence of [Incite], the Ancient Nagak was confused about whether I was a human or a Nagak.</p>
<p>But soon, as if it didn't matter, it came back to swing its claws toward me.</p>
<p>I dodged its claws and rolled across the floor.</p>
<p>After playing the ensemble in succession, the guy's music skills became a little sluggish.</p>
<p>I swung the sword once again without letting go of that gap.</p>
<p>Sgarack.</p>
<p>One more leg was cut off. At this rate, there would be no sudden attack. Instead, the guy's anger was now completely on me.</p>
<p>Kunauuu.</p>
<p>The tropical air was drawn into the ancient Nagak's mouth.</p>
<p>After a while, the ensemble will begin again.</p>
<p>['Broken Faith' disappears.]</p>
<p>[The 'thought of almost everything' refuses to imitate.]</p>
<p>Finally, the imitation time limit was over.</p>
<p>It was possible to regenerate it by using [Incite] again, but the problem was that it was difficult to maintain the 'Blade of Faith'.</p>
<p>I looked back at Shin Yoosoung repeating [taming] from a distance.</p>
<p>「Eventually, she will become the Disaster of Floods.」</p>
<p>Even if I save Shin Yoosoung here, she will cross over to another world line and become the Disaster of Floods.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>That is the fate of this 41st turn.</p>
<p>「In a universe that was born of tragedy from the beginning, it would have been better if it did not exist.」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja's words echoed in my head.</p>
<p>I changed the 'thought' to a magic recovery bracelet and wore it on my wrist.</p>
<p>[Magic recovery bracelet's magic regeneration ability increases.]</p>
<p>I looked up at the Ancient Nagak.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja promised. He promised to watch my story. He told me to do what I want.</p>
<p>[The 6th-grade sea species 'Ancient Nagak' is preparing for a 'wide ensemble'!]</p>
<p>So I'll tell you what I want.</p>
<p>Even if the end of this world is destruction, even if it's an operation that I can't change.</p>
<p>Feeling the air around me thinning, I clenched my fists as if clenching the sides.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill '□□' is activated!]</p>
<p>[Due to the probability restrictions of &lt;Star Stream&gt;, the skill cannot be activated.]</p>
<p>In the process of obtaining my first story, I lost a skill.</p>
<p>I heard the message a while ago, so it wasn't something I didn't know at all.</p>
<p>[This skill cannot be activated with your current skill.]</p>
<p>It was bittersweet for me, who had passed through countless crises thanks to '□□'. Being unable to use that skill was as if I wasn't qualified as the author of this story yet.</p>
<p>But then.</p>
<p>[Some of '□□''s functions are converted to sub-skills.]</p>
<p>[The sub-skill 'Sentence Enhancement' is activated!]</p>
<p>Sentence reinforcement?</p>
<p>「Cheon Inho is □□...□□.」</p>
<p>The moment I saw the sentence inside the message window, I had a sense of what kind of skill this was.</p>
<p>[You can enter your actions.]</p>
<p>[The action you enter is 'reinforced'.]</p>
<p>[The current enhancement level is level 1.]</p>
<p>[You can increase the level of reinforcement by injecting stocked probability.]</p>
<p>[Currently possessed probability: 515.]</p>
<p>Simply put, it felt like a simplified version of '□□'.</p>
<p>I tried writing a sentence to test it.</p>
<p>「Cheon Inho used 'Incite'.」</p>
<p>For a moment, I felt someone staring at me from behind my head. Immediately, vitality surged through my whole body. Someone who seemed to be able to do anything was born. To be precise.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Incite' is enhanced!]</p>
<p>I felt like I could [incite] anything now.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Incite' is temporarily awakened.]</p>
<p>[You can incite yourself to steal the person you want.]</p>
<p>Is that even possible?</p>
<p>[Instigating yourself as a different person has a chance to imitate that person's skill or surname.]</p>
<p>[However, if you incite yourself as a person of a higher rank than you, you will fail with a high probability and receive a penalty.]</p>
<p>[The recurrence rate of Incite increases according to your level of understanding of that person.]</p>
<p>I was surprised.</p>
<p>[Incite so far was a kind of self-suggestion skill.]</p>
<p>It's a little different when I’m in the 'snowfield', but in reality, I can only copy the character's behavior, tone, and personality.</p>
<p>However, according to the description of the skill now, through this [Incite], I will be able to really use that character's power.</p>
<p>Without waiting any longer, I activated [Incite].</p>
<p>A person who can overcome this crisis without difficulty. A person who could have escaped this dungeon without killing the Nagaks.</p>
<p>I thought while watching Shin Yoosoung repeat [taming] from a distance.</p>
<p>[I’m Shin Yoosoung, the 'Disaster of Floods'.]</p>
<p>Tsutsutsutchut.</p>
<p>I could tell without even trying.</p>
<p>This [Incite] is impossible.</p>
<p>In other words, it meant that 'Shin Yoosoung, the Disaster of Floods', was a much higher-ranking being than I am now.</p>
<p>Still, I thought it would be worth a try since I got two stories.</p>
<p>[6th-grade sea species 'Ancient Nagak' starts wide-area ensemble!]</p>
<p>I couldn't take the risk here. If I don't succeed, Shin Yoosoung will die.</p>
<p>This time, I have to overcome the crisis by [Inciting] myself as an existence of a lower rank than me.</p>
<p>The Ancient Nagak, who took all his breath, started playing an ensemble toward me.</p>
<p>I thought as I hid myself in the shells around me.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, the Disaster of Floods, failed. However, what if Shin Yoosoung is from a different time period?</p>
<p>For example, if it were Shin Yoosoung, who was of a lower rank than me. The pages of 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' began to turn over clearly in my head.</p>
<p>「"Ahjussi! Don't go! Please! Don't go!"」</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung was chasing after Kim Dokja, who had become an Outer God.</p>
<p>「"The person I like has also appeared like this."」</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, who participated in 'Journey to the West', the grand story of the &lt;Emperor&gt;.</p>
<p>「"Uh, uh. So... I'm grateful... for receiving this award..."」</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, who participated in the 'War of Good and Evil', was talking about her acceptance speech to Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>「"...Ahjussi."」</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, who was the first to recognize Kim Dokja, who became a giant squid.</p>
<p>The emotions rushing along with the sentences made my head feel like it would explode for a moment.</p>
<p>I went against it and traced the history of Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p>「"Ahjussi."」</p>
<p>The voice of Shin Yoosoung calling Kim Dokja over and over again.</p>
<p>Is it because of the Ancient Nagak's sound?</p>
<p>Even though I knew it wasn't me she was calling, strangely my heart beat.</p>
<p>I read and re-read a story I once wrote.</p>
<p>「"Ahjussi, but this… can only be used against monsters?"」</p>
<p>And finally.</p>
<p>「"Shin Yoosoung, whose eye color has slowly returned, was looking at me."」</p>
<p>The horn shell was crushed by the front legs of the 'Ancient Nagak', and the sound of the ensemble rushed in.</p>
<p>At the same time, I felt that my frequent sentences were nesting in me.</p>
<p>"I am—"</p>
<p>「As if it was nothing, the guy who had a nosebleed said.」</p>
<p>"I am the 'Shin Yoosoung' who tamed 'Queen Mirabad'."</p>
<p>「"Let’s go, Ahjussi."」</p>
<p>[The effect of 'Incite' activates!]</p>
