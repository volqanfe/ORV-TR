<hr/>
<p>Plague-Carrying Rat.</p>
<p>In Omniscient Reader, and in the setting of Ways of Survival, that constellation didn't appear.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it contracts three incarnations and sends them out to attack the 'Edge of Darkness'.</p>
<p>That rat is, like, 100% a reader.</p>
<p>I would have loved to have used [Readers' Comments List] on them, but unfortunately it doesn't</p>
<p>work on targets I couldn't see.</p>
<p>Unless they're possessing an incarnation, I don't know.......</p>
<p>"Hey, guys, we don't have to fight."</p>
<p>I waved my hand at the Ratmen who were glaring in this direction and slowly backed away.</p>
<p>Even Literary Girl 64 I trusted had been poisoned, so it was now a three-to-one fight.</p>
<p>The odds weren't in my favor either way.</p>
<p>However, who am I?</p>
<p>The one who, according to Yoo Joonghyuk, was called 'The One Who Deceived the Stars' in the 40th round.</p>
<p>"Misreading Association, guys. I am not your enemy."</p>
<p>The great villain, the 'Evil Sophist' famous between the constellations.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.3' is activated!]</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, it looks like you're all villains. I happen to be a villain too."</p>
<p>I said, sneaking over to the fallen Killer King.</p>
<p>"So let's make a deal. Is he who you want?"</p>
<p>I grabbed the Killer King by the nape of the neck and lifted him up. Literary Girl 64, who was crouched nearby, looked at me with despair in her eyes.</p>
<p>I smiled lightly at her, then turned back to the Ratmen.</p>
<p>One of the Ratmen said.</p>
<p>"We don't negotiate."</p>
<p>"Stay out of this, rats. I'm talking to your constellation, not you."</p>
<p>At my cold voice, the Ratmen frowned.</p>
<br/>
<p>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' is looking at you with interest.]</p>
<p>I smirked and began to talk.</p>
<p>"As you saw me fight just now, you noticed I'm pretty good myself. If I were to fight at full strength, even your incarnations wouldn't come out unscathed. If three of your incarnations die early on, wouldn't it be a big blow to a constellation like you?"</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' is glaring at you.]</p>
<p>"Even so, do we need to fight each other? This is what you want, and I don't want to get blood on my hands. It's a win-win situation. Give what you have to give, take what you have to take."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' says the Seven Apostles can't be trusted.]</p>
<p>"I am not from the Seven Apostles."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' has used 'Lie Detection'.]</p>
<p>[Your statement is true.]</p>
<p>Now even rats are using that skill.</p>
<p>Well, that rat is a constellation too.</p>
<p>"I'll give you Killer King, in exchange for your random item box."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' says they can't give you the box.]</p>
<p>"Then I'll take the rest of the items here, minus the box."</p>
<p>At my offer, 'Plague-Carrying Rat' seemed to ponder for a moment.</p>
<p>I could hear the Ratmen asking with their squeaks.</p>
<p>—What shall we do?</p>
<p>I opened my mouth as I stealthily moved toward the wall.</p>
<p>"You don't have to ponder about it for long, just think about it. It seems like you've had a pretty rough road yourself, and if we're going to survive in a world like this, we're going to have to work well together. I don't want a plot where the villains turn against each other and end up killing each other."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' asks who the hell are you.]</p>
<p>Tsuchuchut.</p>
<p>Judging by the light sparks all over their body, they were about to unleash their status to intimidate me.</p>
<p>However, 'Plague-Carrying Rat' didn't seem to be a very powerful constellation.</p>
<br/>
<p>Nor would they be free from the constraints of probability at this early stage.</p>
<p>"I'm disappointed. You really don't know who I am? You must not have read the novel properly."</p>
<p>I took another step.</p>
<p>The rat warned me as if they felt something was strange.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' tell you to stop.]</p>
<p>I don't know if I can do it.</p>
<p>"This is the body of the worst villain in Omniscient Reader."</p>
<p>With those words, I plucked out the 'dark flower' that was plugged in nearby.</p>
<p>For a moment, my shadow flickered ominously as the ash-colored torch that sucked in black ether— the 'dark flower' lit up the surroundings.</p>
<p>"The one burnt to death with Hellfire."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' orders his incarnations to kill you right away.]</p>
<p>The Ratmen whistled in unison and fired their poisonous darts.</p>
<p>I used Killer King as a shield.</p>
<p>Pow. Pow. Pow.</p>
<p>The wide-eyed Killer King shuddered convulsively. I had no choice, given the circumstances.</p>
<p>I'll save you, reader-nim, just hang in there.</p>
<p>With Killer King in front of me, I began to charge at the Ratmen. For a moment, they panicked and jumped back.</p>
<p>I flung the dark flower at them with all my might. It spun in the air, sailed past them, and tumbled into the darkness behind them.</p>
<p>A wisp of black smoke billowed from the extinguished flame.</p>
<p>Black ether was being released.</p>
<p>—Beware!</p>
<p>Something began to stir in the center of the dense black ether.</p>
<p>「There was a 'boss monster' here that hadn't died yet.」</p>
<p>In the novel, Kim Dokja did not directly stop the monster's breathing. To do so would incur the curse of the 'Demon King'.</p>
<p>[The ruler of the 'Edge of Darkess' is absorbing the black ether!]</p>
<p>Killer King, who had read Omniscient Reader nearly a hundred times, hadn't forgotten that part either.</p>
<br/>
<p>[The 7th grade demonic species, 'Dark Keeper' has revived!]</p>
<p>The black etheric energy from the dark flower revived the dying 'Dark Keeper'.</p>
<p>Squeak squeak, the Ratmen screamed, and three or four tentacles shot out of the Dark Keeper's body simultaneously.</p>
<p>The Ratmen barely dodged the tentacles.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>Pusyusyusyuk!</p>
<p>They didn't have time to dodge the tentacles that sprang up from the ground below them. In an instant, the three Ratmen screamed and struggled as their stomachs were pierced.</p>
<p>"Kallitu."</p>
<p>With the Dark Keeper's words, something slithered into the three Ratmen's bodies.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' is furious!]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' is increasing their synchronization with the incarnations!]</p>
<p>Realizing the situation too late, Plague-Carrying Rat tried to intervene himself.</p>
<p>But it was a mistake.</p>
<p>Tsuchuchuchuchut!</p>
<p>[The 7th grade demon, 'Dark Keeper' has noticed the presence of the constellation.]</p>
<p>[The 7th grade demon, 'Dark Keeper' prays to its master.]</p>
<p>Kukukukuku.</p>
<p>The whole of the 'Edge of Darkness' shook as if there had been an earthquake.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' panics.]</p>
<p>Someone was looking into this space.</p>
<p>A being far different from 'Plague-Carrying Rat'.</p>
<p>A cold sweat ran down his spine.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' is increasing their synchronization with the incarnations!]</p>
<p>He is the owner of the 32nd Demon Realm.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos's face hardens.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow's eyes shine.]</p>
<p>Devil of Lust and Wrath.</p>
<p>The demon king Asmodeus.</p>
<br/>
<p>[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' stares at 'Plague-Carrying Rat'.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' is dealt a fatal blow.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' groans in terror.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' has left the channel.]</p>
<p>A historical-grade constellation was wiped out with just one glance.</p>
<p>[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' is looking at you with strange eyes.]</p>
<p>From the other side of the abyss, the demon king was looking at me.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.3' is strongly activated!]</p>
<p>「I am Kim Dokja who has the 'Fourth Wall'.」</p>
<p>I met the demon king's gaze undaunted.</p>
<p>[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' is interested in you.]</p>
<p>[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' will remember your name.]</p>
<p>After the message, the gaze vanished. All that remained was the Dark Keeper and me.</p>
<p>I sucked in a breath and stared at him.</p>
<p>"Are you going to fight?"</p>
<p>The Dark Keeper stared back at me and muttered something.</p>
<p>[You understand the language settings.]</p>
<p>[You are interpreting the language of the demon species.]</p>
<p>...from ■■ to ■. The king is watching you.</p>
<p>....... What?</p>
<p>With those words, it disappeared into the darkness with the ratmen.</p>
<p>[The 7th grade demon, 'Dark Keeper' has disappeared from the Ground Rat's Treasure Trove.]</p>
<p>[The 7th grade demon, 'Dark Keeper' has been defeated!]</p>
<p>[The sub scenario 'Kill the Keeper' has ended.]</p>
<p>[You have successfully looted someone else's sub scenario!]</p>
<p>[8,000 coins have been earned.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' admires your courage in the face of a demon king.]</p>
<p>[1,000 coins have been additionally sponsored.]</p>
<p>I was preparing to fight the Dark Keeper if I had to. It was a relief.</p>
<p>So this kind of development is possible too.</p>
<p>In the back, I could see Dansoo ahjussi and Kyung Sein stumbling to their feet.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi? Ouch! What the......."</p>
<p>Judging from their exaggerated voice, they must have woken up and faked a faint to look at the situation.</p>
<p>I laughed bitterly and pointed at Killer King and Literary Girl 64 on the ground.</p>
<p>"Let's save them first."</p>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
<p>According to Ways of Survival's settings notes, there are two ways to dispel the 'poisonous fog'.</p>
<p>Using the 'Elaine Monkey's Lungs', or feeding the 'Elaine Forest Essence'.</p>
<p>However, I couldn't guarantee Keeper King nor Literary Girl64 to recover with any of those two ways.</p>
<p>Especially Killer King, who had been poisoned too many times because of me and his condition was very serious.</p>
<p>"Kup, Kuhup."</p>
<p>Killer King, whose face was ashy, had foam on his mouth and was gasping for air.</p>
<p>Still, I can't let a reader who has read this 99 times die like this.</p>
<p>I pulled out the piece of 'poisonous rhinoceros's horn' I had hidden in my chest and ground it into a fine powder.</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi asked.</p>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>"I picked it up the other day when I met Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p>If my ligaments were still intact, I would have gotten a bigger piece, but my arm was destroyed, so I could only get crumbs.</p>
<p>Luckily, it was enough for now.</p>
<p>I mixed the horn powder with water and poured it into the mouths of Killer King and Literary Girl 64.</p>
<p>After a few moments, Killer King and Literary Girl 64's complexions became noticeably brighter.</p>
<p>「The poisonous rhinoceros's horn has an great effect on the 'poisonous fog'.」</p>
<p>I hadn't realized that it would be used in this way, as I had only created it as a 'Ways of Survival' setting and hadn't used it in the main story.</p>
<p>"Everyone else should take some. It's good for treating the poisonous fog."</p>
<p>"How did you know about this?"</p>
<p>"I experimented with it as soon as I got a piece of horn."</p>
<p>"As expected of Inho-ssi......!"</p>
<p>I recounted what happened a moment ago to Dansoo ahjussi and Kyung Sein as they drank the remaining bottled water.</p>
<p>I purposely didn't tell them about Killer King trying to kill us. I thought there was noo need to create animosity at this point.</p>
<p>"There was also a reader who possessed a constellation? And that was a member of the Misreading Association?"</p>
<p>Kyung Sein seemed almost out of breath when she heard the name Misreading Association.</p>
<p>"Oh, you fought with the Misreading Association?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But they were a little weird?"</p>
<p>Killer King is a also a Killer King, but the person possessing by that Plague-Carrying Rat looked really strange. Even if they entered a novel, how could a person who had been living in the real world until a few days ago suddenly turn into a killer?</p>
<p>Kyung Sein, whose complexion had turned blue, spoke up.</p>
<p>"If it's the Misreading Association, it's possible. Damn it, I can't believe we're meeting them so soon......."</p>
<p>I became a little confused.</p>
<p>"Isn't it just a club?"</p>
<p>"Misreading Association is not just a club."</p>
<p>Huh? Then?</p>
<p>It was Killer King, who had finally regained consciousness, who answered my question.</p>
<p>"Misreading Association is the name of an illegal sharing site."</p>
