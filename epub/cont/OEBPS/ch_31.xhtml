<hr/>
<p>Misreading Association (誤讀協).</p>
<p>Initially, the site was a group of people collecting rare books.</p>
<p>It was a small club where they read books that were discontinued in Korea and were no longer available or untranslated classics, and exchanged opinions among themselves.</p>
<p>However, as the number of members gradually increased and the site grew, problems began to arise.</p>
<p>"Some of the members started to share illegally not only rare books, but also manhwa and novels that had become regular series without permission."</p>
<p>As word got out that paid content was available for free, the site grew and grew, and it began to take on the form of a business. Adult ads were plastered across the site, and illegal gambling money flowed in.</p>
<p>After a few more years, the founding members disappeared, and the site turned into a completely illegal sharing site.</p>
<p>After listening to Kyung Sein's full explanation, I was confused.</p>
<p>"You said the Seven Apostles fought the Misreading Association before."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes."</p>
<p>"Then did the Seven Apostles fight that illegal site?"</p>
<p>"Well, that's......."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein looked at Killer King, and then added quietly.</p>
<p>"The Seven Apostles got into a fight with anonymous readers, who turned out to be people who illegally read the novel on the 'Misreading Association'."</p>
<p>I finally understood what was going on.</p>
<p>They were referring to people who read and shared illegal copies of the novel.</p>
<p>Apparently, in this world, those who read the novel through that route were also transmigrated here.</p>
<p>Killer King said.</p>
<p>"I don't know about you, but there are many writers who stopped creating or even took their own lives because of the Misreading Association."</p>
<p>"......."</p>
<p>"They illegally consumed content that someone dedicated their life to. A lot of my favorite authors have disappeared because of them."</p>
<p>In fact, some of my fellow writers had stopped writing because of illegal sharing.</p>
<p>"Is that why you fought them?"</p>
<p>Killer King shook his head without answering.</p>
<p>Honestly, I was impressed.</p>
<p>As a writer, I've been frustrated by the lack of success in combating illegal sharing, but to have a reader like Killer King be so proactive.</p>
<p>He was fighting for his life, and not just in the comments.</p>
<p>I suddenly wondered what kind of comments Killer King would have left.</p>

<p>I doubted my eyes.</p>
<p>Feeling my gaze, Killer King frowned at me.</p>
<p>"What are you looking at?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, just......."</p>
<p>"If you keep looking at me like that, I'll kill you."</p>
<p>"You really sound like Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p>With a light groan, Killer King pushed himself up and pretended to look away.</p>
<p>He reminded me of a sulky cousin, and I was about to tease him one more time when I heard a voice behind me.</p>
<p>"Hey, thanks for saving me."</p>
<p>Literary Girl 64, who had finally regained consciousness, lowered her head helplessly.</p>
<p>I waved my hands and said.</p>
<p>"No, I was lucky."</p>
<p>"I was lucky."</p>
<p>Killer King added with a nuance that somehow made me feel good.</p>
<p>"They didn't take the random item box."</p>
<p>At that, we stared at the shiny box the Ratmen had dropped.</p>
<p>Killer King and his sister were probably here for that box, too.</p>
<p>Just as things were starting to get uncomfortable, Killer King spoke up.</p>
<p>"I'll give it to you guys."</p>
<p>Literary Girl 64 nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>I could see Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi's faces brighten up.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I shook my head.</p>
<p>"No, thank you, we'll just take the rest of the items."</p>
<p>"Are you serious?"</p>
<p>"Yes. We have enough with the rest of the items."</p>
<p>I looked down at the items on the floor.</p>
<p>I could see the D grade items that Kim Dokja had picked up in the main story, as well as other items that hadn't appeared in the main story.</p>
<p>As if to give me one last chance, Killer King asked again.</p>
<p>"Didn't you read the novel properly? Don't you realize the value of this item box?"</p>
<p>"Seriously, we have enough with the rest. Don't insist."</p>
<p>Killer King hesitated for a moment, then took the item box in his arms with a look of desire in his eyes.</p>
<p>"I owe you. I will pay you back for sure."</p>
<p>With that, Killer King turned around and began to walk away.</p>
<p>Literary Girl 64 bowed her head and ran after her brother.</p>
<p>I asked Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi to organize the items, then escorted Killer King back to the entrance of the Edge of Darkness.</p>
<p>Just before we crossed the edge, Killer King paused.</p>
<p>Neither Dansoo ahjussi nor Kyung Sein could hear the conversation from here.</p>
<p>"I tried to kill you all."</p>
<p>"You did, and it was a really bad thing."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell them that?"</p>
<p>"You didn't kill us, did you?"</p>
<p>Killer King frowned at me, as if he couldn't figure it out.</p>
<p>"You, what's your name?"</p>
<p>"Cheon Inho."</p>
<p>"That Cheon Inho?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>For some reason, this name elicits the same reaction from everyone who hears it.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you're possessing that scumbag. I hope you're not using the Cheoldoo Group to kill people."</p>
<p>"If I was, you'd be dead too."</p>
<p>"You...... Who the hell are you?"</p>
<p>I shrugged and laughed.</p>
<p>For a moment, Killer King's eye flickered with black energy. He had activated the stigma [Eye of Sin].</p>
<p>I was suddenly curious.</p>
<p>"What do I look like to you?"</p>
<p>In his eyes, 'Cheon Inho' was marked as 'the murderer of 15 people'.</p>
<p>「I am Lee Hakhyun.」</p>
<p>Then what does 'writer Lee Hakhyun' look like?</p>
<p>"What......."</p>
<p>The next moment, Killer King's eyes widened, his entire retina turning pitch black like it was full of ink.</p>
<p>I wondered.</p>
<p>What did my sins read in his eyes?</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is startled!]</p>
<p>Tsuchuchuchuchut!</p>
<p>[The stigma 'Eye of Sin' has forcibly ended.]</p>
<p>Groaning in pain, Killer King looked at me with the eye that had used the stigma.</p>
<p>"What the hell are you. No...... that can't be, something must be broken."</p>
<p>Muttering to himself, the Killer King looked at me and said.</p>
<p>"There is no way such a villain exists in this world."</p>
<p>Killer King looked at me.</p>
<p>He was looking at me with clear eyes that weren't using [Eye of Sin], eyes that had probably read Omniscient Reader 99 times.</p>
<p>"I wish you the blessing of the story."</p>
<p>With those last words, Killer King walked away without looking back.</p>
<p>The younger sister glanced in my direction a few times, then followed his brother into the darkness beyond.</p>
<p>I stood still and waved until they were completely out of sight.</p>
<p>Hopefully, they too would be blessed by the story.</p>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
<p>Among the items that Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi had gathered, there were some that were more useful than I thought.</p>
<p>"You can have this shield, Sein-ssi."</p>
<p>"As expected, 'Old Iron Shield' is the rule for tankers."</p>
<p>Old Iron Shield.</p>
<p>An item used by Lee Hyunsung in the original novel.</p>
<p>Among us, it was the most suited for Kyung Sein to use.</p>
<p>"I'll give you the Magic Power Recovery Bracelet."</p>
<p>"Is it okay if I take it...... Thank you."</p>
<p>Ahjussi put the bracelet on his wrist as if it were a luxury watch and smiled happily.</p>
<p>That bracelet should be quite useful, since he uses [Diverse Communication].</p>
<p>Other than that, there were rings with faint anti-demonic abilities and gloves that provided a very slight defense boost.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate, but at least this early, I can live with it.</p>
<p>The last thing that caught my eye was an item that looked like spoiled jelly.</p>
<fieldset>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">[Item Information]</h3>
<p>Name: Unformed Idea</p>
<p>Rating: D</p>
<p>Description: A shapeless weapon of the past. It could have been anything, but ultimately became nothing.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Come to think of it, I once designed an item like this. It was just a setting, and I didn't think it would be here.</p>
<p>Once again, I feel certain.</p>
<p>There are countless 'settings' in this world that didn't make it into the main story, but remained in my notes.</p>
<p>「So, did I make those settings, or did Han Sooyoung tell me about them?」</p>
<p>It was then that Kyung Sein spoke up.</p>
<p>"By the way, Inho-ssi."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"The random item box, why did you give it up?"</p>
<p>I wondered why she didn't ask that yet.</p>
<p>By the look on her face, she had been thinking about it for a while. People might think I'd lost the first prize in the lotto.</p>
<p>Well, this is more important to me right now than a winning lotto ticket.</p>
<p>"Actually, I was wondering the same thing, mate."</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi raised his hand cautiously.</p>
<p>No wonder it looked strange in their eyes.</p>
<p>It wasn't just any item, but the 'random item box'.</p>
<p>It was an essential item to restore Kim Dokja's star relic, Unbroken Faith.</p>
<p>My reasoning for surrendering the item box was simple.</p>
<p>"That box, I wouldn't be able to use it anyway."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Someone else already used it."</p>
<p>"No way...... Who?"</p>
<p>"Did those Misreading Association guys secretly use it?"</p>
<p>I shook my head at Dansoo ahjussi's words.</p>
<p>"Someone already came here before us."</p>
<p>I'm sure. It was just a moment, but I opened the item box myself to check. The item had already been used to zero.</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi asked.</p>
<p>"Was there a reader who came before us?"</p>
<p>"We started at Geumho Station and only got here today. Our friend who read Omniscient Reader 99 times arrived here today."</p>
<p>"Then who the hell could have......."</p>
<p>"Common sense tells me there's only one person who can do this at this point."</p>
<p>As if realizing who I was referring to, Kyung Sein swallowed hard and said.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>It was only about a stop and a half from Oksu Station to here.</p>
<p>If it was the same Yoo Joonghyuk who could defeat a 7th grade monster species with one hit, he could come in an hour.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein, who was thinking about something, muttered.</p>
<p>"Yes, in the third round, Yoo Joonghyuk stole only the treasures, but I don't remember him</p>
<p>knowing about the 'random item box' back then."</p>
<p>"There's a description that mentions he heard about it from the Heavenly Maid Hori in the 6th round. It's the 41st round, so of course he knew."</p>
<p>"Ah......."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein lowered her head with a dejected expression.</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi, who had a serious look on his face, also shook his head.</p>
<p>"It's certainly a lot different from the 3rd round with Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>"Very different."</p>
<p>Even though it was only the 41st round, Yoo Joonghyuk here had much different experiences than the 3rd round.</p>
<p>It's probably safe to say that many of the items that Kim Dokja utilized in the beginning, Yoo Joonghyuk would take first.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein suddenly raised her head and opened her mouth.</p>
<p>"Wait, so the box Killer King took earlier......."</p>
<p>He must be angry that he was tricked by the villain. Kyung Sein asked with admiration.</p>
<p>"Wow...... Inho-ssi, when did you plan that much?"</p>
<p>"When I realized the box had been robbed."</p>
<p>"You're so mean and smart."</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>"It's good I'm on your side, Inho-ssi. Although it's a shame about the box......."</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi said, looking around at the items we had won.</p>
<p>"Still, we got a lot of stuff."</p>
<p>It wasn't all fruitless though, as we got some useful items in the beginning, including the ahjussi's bracelet and Kyung Sein's shield.</p>
<p>But it's a shame to just take these.......</p>
<p>I pondered for a moment, and then looked again at the place where the 'random item box' was originally placed.</p>
<p>It was around here.</p>
<p>I crouched down on the ground and started digging.</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi and Kyung Sein looked puzzled at my sudden movement. I turned to them and said.</p>
<p>"If you don't mind, please help me. Something is bothering me."</p>
<p>"Did Omniscient Reader say there was something else here?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't think so."</p>
<p>I wasn't sure either, but it was better than not checking.</p>
<p>「"Author-nim. I think it's a little...... no matter how popular it is these days."」</p>
<p>I heard Ji Eunyoo's voice in my head.</p>
<p>It was a memory from five years ago.</p>
<p>She was working hard on the first draft of 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<p>「"If you give things like this from the beginning, there's no tension."&lt;br&gt;"Then what should I do?"&lt;br&gt;"I think it's better to go with the first draft."&lt;br&gt;"That sounds good, right?"」</p>
<p>I don't know how long the three of us dug.</p>
<p>I felt something hard on my fingertips.</p>
<p>"Ugh, what's here?"</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' widens their eyes.]</p>
<p>We shook off the dirt, lifting the object in the hole at the same time.</p>
<p>After a moment, the pitch black dirt slid away, revealing the object we had pulled out.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' opens his mouth.]</p>
<p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is surprised.]</p>
<p>What we found was a black box with a familiar appearance.</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi and Kyung Sein looked down at the box in a daze, then turned to me and asked.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi, is this......?"</p>
<p>I remembered Ji Eunyoo's words.</p>
<p>Originally, there was more than one 'random item box' hidden here.</p>
