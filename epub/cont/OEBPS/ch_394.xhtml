<hr/>
<p>Amidst the undulating scenery, 「Staging」 was activated. The implications were clear.</p>
<p>「Apollon and the Constellations have obtained the tale of the second round’s 'Returnee War'.」</p>
<p>['Staging' is truly activating.]</p>
<p>[It seems that the 'Demon of the Horizon' gave the real thing.]</p>
<p>The Demon of the Horizon.</p>
<p>They had succeeded in obtaining the tale of another worldline through a deal with a sponsor.</p>
<p>[Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.]</p>
<p>But I wasn't panicked.</p>
<p>[This 'Staging' isn't perfect.]</p>
<p>'Staging' doesn't normally activate with tales alone.</p>
<p>The key conditions for a proper 'Staging' are the 'main characters' and 'tales' that will recreate the relevant history. The likelihood of the story being staged is further enhanced when historical locations or 'mediation' are included. But the Constellations had activated 'Staging' with just a single story. That meant they had forcibly recreated the stage, leveraging the probability of the Giant Nebula.</p>
<p>[A stage activated in that manner cannot function properly. I will help. If we fight together—]</p>
<p>Tsutsutsu, sparks flew through the air at that moment. The surrounding scenery grew even darker. The approaching Constellations—especially Apollo—saw the powerful narrating power pulsating through their entire bodies.</p>
<p>['Staging' intensifies!]</p>
<p>That couldn't be.</p>
<p>Even with a Giant Nebula, there was no way they could recreate such a forced stage.</p>
<p>As if reading my thoughts, Apollo spoke.</p>
<p>[Did you think it was an 'incomplete stage'?]</p>
<p>Two heads dangling from the creature's waistband were visible. One was unfamiliar, but the other belonged to someone I knew well.</p>
<p>「Blood Demon, Yeom Baekho.」</p>
<p>The head of the Blood Demon, who had driven Breaking the Sky Sword Saint to her death in the second round’s battle, hung on Apollo's waist, staring at me. Goosebumps slowly crept up my spine as I watched the bloody tears streaming from its eyes.</p>
<p>「Only then did Kim Dokja understand the design of this stage.」</p>
<p>To recreate this stage, the Constellations had traveled to other 'Murim' regions, harvesting the heads of the Blood Demon and Heavenly Demon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, perhaps using a special method, the Blood Demon survived, writhing with only his head remaining.</p>
<p>[It's time to complete the stage, you poor mortal.]</p>
<p>Apollo rammed the Blood Demon's head into the center of the artificial sun floating behind him.</p>
<p>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa—!</p>
<p>The Blood Demon's head opened its eyes and let out a terrifying scream. A torrent of stories flowed ceaselessly from its gaping mouth.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Master of the Blood Cult', begins its storytelling!]</p>
<p>Transplanting a living Blood Demon into an artificial sun to recreate it as a 'character' required for this stage.</p>
<p>「This was Apollo and the Constellations' plan.」</p>
<p>Even Vidar had inserted the head of the Heavenly Demon into the maw of his sacred relic, the 'Wolf Skin'.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Vidar's wolf skin possessed the power to borrow the stories of the 'incarnations' it devoured.</p>
<p>[The effect of the item, 'Wolf Skin of the End', is activated!]</p>
<p>[The reproducibility of 'Staging' is enhanced!]</p>
<p>I never would have thought those lazy Constellations would prepare so thoroughly just to take down a single Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.</p>
<p>[Strike.]</p>
<p>At Apollo's command, the Constellations charged towards Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Returnee War, continues its storytelling.]</p>
<p>The flurries of spears and swords flying from all directions were ominous. Like martial artists using formations, the Constellations, gathered together, were blocking the sword of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.</p>
<p>[You otherworldly monster! You're finally weakened!]</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's body was covered in wounds. Her arms, legs, back. As the sudden explosion of stories drifted through the air, Apollo's artificial sun shone brightly.</p>
<p>[Get out of the way.]</p>
<p>The Blood Demon embedded in the artificial sun opened its mouth, and a flash of light erupted, striking Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's left arm.</p>
<p>「Anti-flame flash.」</p>
<p>Apollo's stigma, unquenchable until its target was reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>As the blazing flames spread, burning her left arm to a pitch-black ember, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint cut it off without a moment's hesitation. Her left arm fell to the ground, crumbling like rotten wood. The Constellations, seizing the moment, thrust their swords once more.</p>
<p>[Now! Kill!]</p>
<p>Watching Apollo's artificial sun reload its flash once more, I stood beside Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.</p>
<p>[I will help.]</p>
<p>The enemy numbered in the hundreds of Constellations. Even if I joined the battle now, it might not have much of an impact on the battlefield. However.</p>
<p>[I will try to prevent this 'Staging'.]</p>
<p>In the '40th round', I fought the Blood Demon as 'Cheon Inho', and I even inflicted a spirit of magic possession on the Blood Demon with [Incite].</p>
<p>As I vividly recalled that memory, I felt the slumbering story within me awaken.</p>
<p>[The effect of the trait, 'Record Repairer', activates!]</p>
<p>「"There's no place for you in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;. You're nothing more than a speck of dust, not even a supporting role. Accept that fact, and you'll feel better. Go back to where you used to live. And never show your face again."」</p>
<p>[The story, 'Gaslighting Expert', temporarily awakens!]</p>
<p>One of my traits manifested, and the story of the 40th round began to inhabit my entire being.</p>
<p>Of course, this history wasn't related to the 'Blood Demon' of the 41st round.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some history can transcend worldlines and manifest its influence.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Blood Demon's reaction to my story was peculiar.</p>
<p>"What, whatwhatwhatwhatwhatwhatwhat—"</p>
<p>[The 'Staging' begins to shake!]</p>
<p>The Blood Demon's expression, pierced by the artificial sun, distorted like a vicious slaughter, and he began to tremble.</p>
<p>Halla tilted her head at the Blood Demon's strange reaction and asked.</p>
<p>[What is it? Apollo. What's going on?]</p>
<p>Apollo was equally strange. His face paled, as if he'd eaten something rotten, and he glared at me.</p>
<p>[That guy unleashed a strange story on the stage.]</p>
<p>He seemed to have realized I was the culprit disrupting the 'Staging'.</p>
<p>[Kick out the uninvited guests.]</p>
<p>I said, swatting away the weapons rushing toward me.</p>
<p>[The uninvited guests are not me, but you.]</p>
<p>I leaped onto the stage of the 'Returnee War.</p>
<p>[The Constellation, 'First Heavenly Demon', watches your exploits!]</p>
<p>[The Constellation, 'Maritime War God', awaits your transformation!]</p>
<p>The Constellations charging toward Breaking the Sky Sword Saint turned to me. I sneered faintly at the sight of the Five Hundred Generals, each wearing the rags of dead martial artists, trying to enhance the stage performance even a little.</p>
<p>[What do you hope to become by taking over the stage of the incarnations like this?]</p>
<p>[Shut up!]</p>
<p>A blind arrow grazed my side. All the Constellations gathered here were at least Narrative-grade. It was clearly a critical situation. The power of the stage incarnation was powerful, and the number of enemies was simply too great.</p>
<p>「I smiled at them.」</p>
<p>The 'Kim Dokja' within me was awakening.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', rejoices in you.]</p>
<p>The history of resisting Fate and fighting against the Constellations commanded me on my behalf.</p>
<p>「Use the power of the King of Fear.」</p>
<p>The moment the fearful story, imperfectly floating within me, was about to reveal its true form once again.</p>
<p>[Not yet.]</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Sword Saint’s large hand gripped my shoulder. The shadow of a giant loomed overhead. She, who had activated [Immortal Immortality] and [Protective Strength] to withstand the Constellations’ attacks, stood in my way.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', glares at 'Breaking the Sky Sword Saint Namgung Minyoung'.]</p>
<p>The sparks that flew wildly burned Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's right hand, turning it pitch-black.</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Sword Saint silently endured the pain and spoke.</p>
<p>[This is not a space granted to you.]</p>
<p>Vines sprouted from the ground, entangling my limbs. Before I could even call Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's name, the Constellations stirred. It was a breathtaking sight, as if all the Constellations in the world were pouring down on her. Breaking the Sky Sword Saint silently readjusted her grip on her sword.</p>
<p>「Breaking the Sky Yuseonggyeol.」</p>
<p>The secret energy of [Breaking the Sky Sword Saint] erupted once more.</p>
<p>Kwakwakwakwakwakwakwa.</p>
<p>Stories blossomed from her entire body.</p>
<p>A boundlessly magnificent and beautiful story blossom.</p>
<p>The sword's shattering shattered into thousands of fragments, piercing through the Constellations. The 'Returnee War' wasn't necessarily a battlefield unfavorable to Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.</p>
<p>「This is the power of a mortal who has reached the pinnacle of transcendence.」</p>
<p>During the Noble War, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint single-handedly annihilated 90% of the Blood Cult and Demonic Cult and successfully repelled most of the disasters.</p>
<p>「Amidst the cries of disaster filled with vengeful spirits, the indifferent Breaking the Sky Sword dominated the battlefield.」</p>
<p>The Constellations that supported the Blood Demon and Heavenly Demon suffered significant losses due to Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's actions. Later, the 'Return War' became an opportunity for the constellations to become wary of the existence of the 'Transcendental Alliance'.</p>
<p>[Kuaaaaaaah! Why! The 'Stage Effect' was clearly activated, but why—]</p>
<p>The narrative unfolded on the stage. The more Breaking the Sky Sword Saint exerted her power, the more the Constellations were helplessly swept away. Perhaps Yoo Joonghyuk had seen Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's back countless times.</p>
<p>「There was a master of the Regressor, feared even by the Constellations.」</p>
<p>It’s truly a martial arts that had reached the realm of god. Perhaps a single individual's power could shatter the 'Stage'—a fleeting hope.</p>
<p>If it weren't for a single sword that had pierced, waiting for an opening, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint would surely have succeeded in destroying the Constellations’ stage.</p>
<p>「And then a single sword pierced the god's waist.」</p>
<p>Halla's mantra was heard.</p>
<p>[You are truly an incredible incarnation.]</p>
<p>With a thud, a pitch-black blade pierced breaking the Sky Sword Saint's abdomen.</p>
<p>I knew that sword.</p>
<p>「Heavenly Demon Divine Sword.」</p>
<p>The divine relic of the Demon Sect that had fatally wounded Breaking the Sky Sword Saint in the second round.</p>
<p>[The influence of 'Staging' is strengthened!]</p>
<p>Halla, holding the Heavenly Demon Divine Sword, spoke with admiration.</p>
<p>[I acknowledge you, great mortal.]</p>
<p>As Halla's story began to infuse her swordplay, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's body began to freeze. Constellations' attacks rained down on her frozen body.</p>
<p>「Thus, the end of the Return War was drawing near.」</p>
<p>Seeing Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's body crumbling, I cried out in a fit of rage.</p>
<p>[Breaking the Sky Sword Saint! Release me!]</p>
<p>But the vines, as if responding to my command, tightened their grip on me.</p>
<p>At that moment, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's body unleashed another explosive blast. Halla's incarnation body was flung away with a roar of shock, and Breaking the Sky Sword Saint called out to me.</p>
<p>[Sad Recorder of the Stars.]</p>
<p>I gazed into her eyes.</p>
<p>A gleam of light.</p>
<p>Her eyes, facing my ■■, burned like bright stars.</p>
<p>No, perhaps it was her.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the starlight in the sky she had gazed upon all her life. To shatter the sky contained in those eyes, she had swung her sword for all those ages.</p>
<p>[Do you still think you can fight the world?]</p>
<p>Her [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship] moved. With each trajectory, the starlight in the sky flickered. The sky was so lush with stars that a single sword could cut through it.</p>
<p>[You can fight, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. Unleash this now. It's not too late. You can change history.]</p>
<p>I felt the passage of time slowly slowing. It was proof that this 'stage' was drawing near its conclusion.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's expression remained composed. As if sitting on the veranda sipping a cup of tea, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint spoke to me in a calm and serene voice.</p>
<p>[It was the first time my disciple brought a friend to Murim.]</p>
<p>Memories flowed through her clear vision.</p>
<p>「"Breaking the Sky Sword Saint."」</p>
<p>When I first visited Murim with Yoo Joonghyuk, now a child, to enter Fear Realm—I told her that.</p>
<p>「"Isn't there really a single tree left in this Murim that you seek to protect?"」</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Sword Saint continued, as if answering that age-old question.</p>
<p>[My disciple is a mistrustful person. His distrust was so great that he would often vomit even food prepared by his master.]</p>
<p>Explosive stories began to rise from her body. The story blossoms took the form of pitch-black trees, instantly covering the ground, soon blocking out even the starlight and forming a forest.</p>
<p>[When we first met, you asked me how many trees it takes to make a forest.]</p>
<p>In the pitch-black forest, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's eyes shone with a dazzling starlight.</p>
<p>[I've protected this Murim for a long time, but I still don't know the answer.]</p>
<p>Only when I met her eyes did I fully realize what Breaking the Sky Sword Saint had been protecting all this time.</p>
<p>「She wasn't protecting 'Murim'.」</p>
<p>Since Yoo Joonghyuk's return began, what she had protected was simply a landscape for one person.</p>
<p>A place where the returning man, exhausted from his long journey, would temporarily block the starlight for him when he turned around.</p>
<p>The Constellations roared, trying to destroy the forest. The forest leaves rustled violently, erupting in a deafening roar.</p>
<p>[However, no matter how many trees there were—]</p>
<p>As night faded and dawn broke, starlight began to slowly filter through the forest she had created. In that poignant yet beautiful landscape, I finally understood Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>[I wish the place where my disciple stood could be called a forest.]</p>
<p>The reason he never gave up on the scenarios, despite being betrayed, hurt, and despairing so much.</p>
<p>「Yoo Joonghyuk has long resembled his teacher.」</p>
<p>Even if only one tree remained in the forest, he would not give up on it.</p>
<p>[So, please take good care of the forest, young Recorder.]</p>
<p>A giant tree was falling before my eyes.</p>
