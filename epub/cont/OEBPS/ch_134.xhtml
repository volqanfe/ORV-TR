<hr/>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' begins its storytelling!]</p>
<p>A strong feeling of a foreign object in my head. In the place where my consciousness should be, there was something—a story—sitting there.</p>
<p>It was ordering me.</p>
<p>「I am the only one」</p>
<p>The moment I heard the first syllable, I got goosebumps. Because I knew what kind of sentence it was.</p>
<p>「who knows the ending of this world」</p>
<p>The introduction of 『Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint』.</p>
<p>The sentence I once wrote has now returned to me and become a curse.</p>
<p>It has been done.</p>
<p>「I am the only Kim Dokja」</p>
<p>The universe opened up before my eyes, and an image of dozens, hundreds, and thousands of meteors scattering all at once came to mind.</p>
<p>「If I can't be Kim Dokja」</p>
<p>「I would rather Kim Dokja did not exist in this universe.」</p>
<p>Whose wish is that? I didn't know where the sentence came from.</p>
<p>What is certain is that I never wrote it and there is no way Han Sooyoung wrote this sentence.</p>
<p>The fact that this story has this sentence probably means that this story also originates from 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p>I saw Lee Dansu approaching nearby.</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is craving it.]</p>
<p>The 'thoughts' that were  in the shape of a bracelet soon changed into the damaged bamboo suit of Master Samyeong.</p>
<p>The hand holding the bamboo pole was shaking.</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' commands feasting.]</p>
<p>I said, grabbing the wrist holding the bamboo pole with my other hand.</p>
<p>"Shut up."</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is glaring at you.]</p>
<p>I declared that I would definitely become Kim Dokja. However, that meant that I would shoulder Kim Dokja's duty, not that I would listen to the unreasonable orders of the story.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi—"</p>
<p>Maybe I, too, changed after meeting Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p>Even if the world grabs me and shakes me, I will not be swayed by this irrational story.</p>
<p>If I don't control the story, the story will control me.</p>
<p>"You are my story. Listen to me."</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is laughing at you.]</p>
<p>I bit my lip as I looked at the readers running towards me.</p>
<p>This story was something I couldn't handle right now.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja's name was too heavy and the person I am now is too me.</p>
<p>I was weak.</p>
<p>"I."</p>
<p>But I swore. I made a promise to Han Sooyoung, who wrote the story.</p>
<p>"I am Kim Dokja.”</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' controls your right arm.]</p>
<p>As if it couldn't hear me, my right arm began to gain magical power.</p>
<p>The story was controlling my right arm. I guess it’s planning to kill and take the readers with my right hand.</p>
<p>"I warned you."</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' frowns.]</p>
<p>[The story says that if the successor of the eternal name does not eat another 'Kim Dokja', you will disappear.]</p>
<p>I don't want to survive that way.</p>
<p>I'd rather—</p>
<p>"Oh, ahjussi! No! Ahjussi."</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung seemed to have an ominous premonition and clung to my waist.</p>
<p>"It's okay."</p>
<p>I used [Incite] to change the 'damaged master’s bamboo pole' to 'Broken Faith'. The blade was activated with shining light.</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is staring at you!]</p>
<p>As if it was trying to control me, the sparks sparked by the story tightened my entire body. I resisted it with all my magical power.</p>
<p>Okay, let's fight.</p>
<p>Either you win or I win.</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is astonished.]</p>
<p>I held back my 'Broken Faith' and stabbed the knife straight into my stomach.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Even in the distant pain, I did not lose consciousness. This is because if I let go of my consciousness, the story could control my body.</p>
<p>"Did he harm himself?"</p>
<p>"Snowflakes are flying wild all over his body."</p>
<p>"Please bring me a blood transfusion pack quickly!"</p>
<p>"A blood transfusion is not enough. Use this."</p>
<p>"This—"</p>
<p>"It’s my story."</p>
<p>Voices were heard above the surface of my fragile consciousness.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi! Inho-ssi! No, why did Inho-ssi become like this!"</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>"Save him right now. If you can't save him, I'll kill you all."</p>
<p>The sound of an explosion was heard intermittently.</p>
<p>"What's the matter? Suddenly—"</p>
<p>"Damn, an emergency scenario has begun!"</p>
<p>"Oh my god. Monsters—"</p>
<p>"There is not much power left here. The main focus of the seventh scenario is the United States."</p>
<p>"Then what should we do!"</p>
<p>"Let’s go to Gwanghwamun."</p>
<p>"But Inho-ssi—"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>['Midday Tryst' has been restored.]</p>
<p>—Stand up, youngest.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes, an excruciating pain came from my lower abdomen.</p>
<p>I exhaled several times, enduring the feeling of my stomach turning.</p>
<p>My mind slowly became clearer.</p>
<p>I felt that the presence of the story that had been controlling me until a moment ago had disappeared.</p>
<p>A sense of liberation slowly bloomed in my heart.</p>
<p>[Your sponsor is looking at you.]</p>
<p>Kim Dokja's voice sounded as if he was dumbfounded in the air.</p>
<p>—Yoo Joonghyuk also doesn’t control the stories in that way.</p>
<p>"This was the only way."</p>
<p>The only way to stop the story.</p>
<p>Although it was a bit unconventional, it was the most powerful action I could take right now.</p>
<p>Considering that the story is quiet, it seems like it was successful anyway.</p>
<p>"What about other readers?"</p>
<p>—They're safe. But did you really have to use that method? You could have just used [Incite].</p>
<p>"Because it might not work."</p>
<p>—After thinking that far, you made a hole in your stomach?</p>
<p>"Now I’m a little bit like Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>—What the hell.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja's voice sounded like he was having fun. I also smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>When I slowly looked around, it seemed like I had been admitted to a ward in a temporary shelter. As I pulled out the IV in my arm, my fingertips trembled ominously. It feels like it will break into pieces if someone touches me.</p>
<p>The status of my being was shaking.</p>
<p>Was this how 49% Kim Dokja felt?</p>
<p>A thumping sound echoed from afar. The sound of a building collapsing. People were screaming and moaning. I walked through the tent of my temporary shelter and looked outside.</p>
<p>People who had been practicing repeatedly until the end were scattered throughout Gwanghwamun along with all kinds of monsters.</p>
<p>I quickly gathered my thoughts and asked.</p>
<p>"What happened?"</p>
<p>—The scenario has begun.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, a message log appeared in my mind.</p>
<p>[A sub-scenario is currently in progress.]</p>
<fieldset>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">&lt;Sub Scenario — Monster Invasion&gt;</h3>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: A++</p>
<p>Clear conditions: The Balaur tribe, who have a deep grudge against humans, have invaded the Korean peninsula. Stop the invasion and protect your world.</p>
<p>Timeout: —</p>
<p>Reward: Lesser Dragon Heart, ???</p>
<p>Failure: —</p>
</fieldset>
<p>It wasn't the main scenario.</p>
<p>It's probably one of the derivative scenarios of the 'main scenario'.</p>
<p>"If it’s a dragon, what level is it?"</p>
<p>—Minimum 5th grade.</p>
<p>My heart sank.</p>
<p>This is because in the fourth scenario, the memory of almost dying when hunting a '5th grade Poisonous Dragon' came to mind.</p>
<p>But the surprise quickly subsided.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, it's the 'seventh scenario'.</p>
<p>During the time I was unconscious, my companions must have already faced 'catastrophe level' monsters several times.</p>
<p>In other words, the current group might be able to handle 5th grade or so.</p>
<p>—There is also a 4th grade one.</p>
<p>"4th grade?"</p>
<p>4th grade was a monster I had never faced before. Even if we say that it is up to 5th grade, 4th grade is on a different level. But.</p>
<p>"Where is Yoo Joonghyuk?"</p>
<p>I remembered Yoo Joonghyuk from the 41st round.</p>
<p>A monster with more overwhelming force than in the 3rd round.</p>
<p>Anyone who cleared all of the disaster scenarios while I was away would be able to deal with even a 4th grade species.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>"Aaaah! Stop it!"</p>
<p>"Save me! Please help me!"</p>
<p>"Aaaahhh!"</p>
<p>No matter where I looked on the battlefield, I could not see Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>—That guy was forcibly summoned to the final field of the 'seventh scenario' a little while ago.</p>
<p>"Ah."</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, the hour I promised with Yoo Joonghyuk has already passed.</p>
<p>Fortunately or unfortunately, the faces of the readers were not visible.</p>
<p>Dansu ahjussi, Killer King, Ye Hyunwoo, and Kyung Sein.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's colleagues, such as Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung, Kim Namwoon and Lee Seolhwa were also nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>It seemed like everyone had moved to the main scenario area.</p>
<p>"Then the people left here—"</p>
<p>—Only selected incarnations can participate in the main event of the seventh scenario. Those people...</p>
<p>People who were not chosen.</p>
<p>The problem was that it wasn't just one or two.</p>
<p>"Aaaahhh!"</p>
<p>Among them were some faces I recognized. For example, Bang Cheolsoo and the mother and daughter.</p>
<p>"Aaaah! Push on! If it continues like this, it will break through!"</p>
<p>"Dayoung! Stick this way!"</p>
<p>Sergeants Kim and Jung Eunho, who fought with me at Seoul Station, were also seen.</p>
<p>"There! There’s a hole over there!"</p>
<p>"I’ll take care of it!"</p>
<p>A pair of chopsticks thrown by Jung Eunho caused them to scream and fall down. Behind them, Shin Yoosoung was also seen summoning Nagak troops to cover the people.</p>
<p>"Fight! Keep fighting!"</p>
<p>They fell helpless before the fire of the Avatars.</p>
<p>However, there were more groups running after their own people. At the center of the group of monsters was a dragon that controlled the monster species.</p>
<p>"You can’t let them go to the shelter! Stop them!"</p>
<p>A woman stood in the center of the battlefield, confronting the dragon tribe.</p>
<p>After possessing a character in this world, it was the first member of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; I encountered.</p>
<p>[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' activates 'Kendo Lv.10'!]</p>
<p>Every time Jung Heewon swung her sword, five or six cherubs died.</p>
<p>I watched Jung Heewon's fight, even forgetting to breathe. Over the past 45 days, I could see how hard she had trained.</p>
<p>One step. The balance of the battlefield seemed to be shaken every time the magic power contained in one trajectory caused a ripple.</p>
<p>Krarar La La Lag!</p>
<p>The panicked 5th grade monster swung its tail and counterattacked, but Jung Heewon's momentum showed no signs of stopping.</p>
<p>In an instant, Jung Heewon climbed up the tail and struck with a sword strike.</p>
<p>A sword equipped with strong magical power.</p>
<p>In less than five seconds, dozens of consecutive strikes pierced the 5th grade species' eyes and forehead.</p>
<p>Ahhh!</p>
<p>As one 5th grade species fell with a roar, the expressions on the incarnations' faces changed.</p>
<p>They got brighter.</p>
<p>"It fell down!"</p>
<p>"We can win! We can win!"</p>
<p>As the morale of the incarnations rose, the monsters hesitated and cried out in fear.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon ran toward the next dragon without hesitation.</p>
<p>What stopped her advance sweeping the battlefield was a monster the size of a 10-story building.</p>
<p>[4th grade monster 'Earth Python'’is roaring!]</p>
<p>Howling, all the incarnations in the area screamed and fell down at once.</p>
<p>Even Jung Heewon stumbled, bleeding from her ears.</p>
<p>But Jung Heewon didn't sit down.</p>
<p>[Madness]</p>
<p>A destructive glow flashed in her pupils. The unique characteristics of the 'Mad Butcher' were protecting her consciousness.</p>
<p>"Everybody wake up."</p>
<p>At the sound of Jung Heewon's voice, people who had been rolling around on the floor stood up as if they were infected with madness.</p>
<p>They were all people who couldn't fight any longer.</p>
<p>I couldn't understand.</p>
<p>Why don't you run away?</p>
<p>There is no penalty for failure in this 'sub-scenario'.</p>
<p>That meant that they could let Gwanghwamun be destroyed without having to fight back.</p>
<p>Perhaps Yoo Joonghyuk knew that too, so he left here without taking any action.</p>
<p>"No way..."</p>
<p>—That's right.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, people were forming a circle around my temporary shelter.</p>
<p>—They’re protecting you.</p>
<p>I looked closely at the faces of all the remaining people.</p>
<p>Geumho Station, Chungmuro, Seoul Station. Faces that I have passed by at least once somewhere.</p>
<p>"Hey, Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p>A middle-aged man who spotted me exclaimed with joy.</p>
<p>"Everyone, look! The captain—"</p>
<p>Yes. With a sound, the man whose neck had been bitten by the monster fell down.</p>
<p>"Kim ahjussi!" A woman cried.</p>
<p>Before I could say anything, a crowd of people rushed in and covered the two of us. I held 'Broken Faith' in my hands.</p>
<p>Let’s use [Incite].</p>
<p>Let’s incite me to call myself Yoo Joonghyuk. No, Jung Heewon, and Kim Dokja. Anyone is good.</p>
<p>Anything is fine—</p>
<p>[This skill cannot be activated.]</p>
<p>It felt like someone was hitting a gong in my head.</p>
<p>[Your incarnation body is currently unstable.]</p>
<p>[Achieve 'Kim Dokja’s dismissal' within 5 minutes.]</p>
<p>[If the new 'Kim Dokja Fragment' cannot be acquired, you will die.]</p>
<p>I was dying.</p>
<p>Maybe faster than them.</p>
<p>[Time left until death: 4:49]</p>
<p>The flood of stories has subsided, but the penalty has not disappeared.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I wanted to save them, but I couldn't think of a way.</p>
<p>I cannot do it.</p>
<p>Even though the people protecting me are dying before my eyes, there is nothing I can do.</p>
<p>ㅡYoo Joonghyuk made you his colleague.</p>
<p>My constellation’s voice came to my ear.</p>
<p>—And yet he left you behind. Why did he do that?</p>
<p>I slowly raised my head.</p>
<p>The reason Yoo Joonghyuk left me here.</p>
<p>"Did he think I could solve this scenario?"</p>
<p>Kim Dokja did not answer.</p>
<p>As my emotions slowly subsided, I could see the situation clearly.</p>
<p>There is no Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>People are dying.</p>
<p>[Time left until death: 3:08]</p>
<p>I have 3 minutes left to live.</p>
<p>To activate a skill. I had to remove the penalty for this story first.</p>
<p>「Only me」</p>
<p>A penalty that only disappears if I eat 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p>Then, there was only one way to tell this story.</p>
<p>"Heir of the Eternal Name."</p>
<p>Giving Kim Dokja, the only person in this world who I can use as 'fodder' for my story.</p>
<p>I raised my right arm to my mouth and ordered the story.</p>
<p>"Eat 'me'."</p>
