<p>"Stories are not subject to the rules of time. They just flow towards an empty place."</p>
<p>ーDokkaebi King</p>
<hr/>
<p>How is 'Han Sooyoung' here?</p>
<p>Is that person really the Han Sooyoung of 『Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint』 that I know?</p>
<p>My intuition said yes, but my reason demanded verification.</p>
<p>[This is a target that you cannot use 'List of Reader Comments' on.]</p>
<p>['Character List' is unavailable.]</p>
<p>Target unavailable.</p>
<p>"Really, are you Han Sooyoung?"</p>
<p>I've never had such a message pop up before.</p>
<p>「I didn't expect it.」</p>
<p>When I found out that this world was the 41st turn not in the original work.</p>
<p>After seeing kkomas Kim Dokja at the theater.</p>
<p>And when I met Kim Dokja in the snowfield in my dream.</p>
<p>Maybe, I've been imagining that this moment would come.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung looked at me blankly and said, "Yes. I'm Han Sooyoung."</p>
<p>[Someone is activating 'Lie detection'.]</p>
<p>['Lie detection' has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p>
<p>Up to authentication with lie detection.</p>
<p>Even the thorough appearance was exactly the Han Sooyoung I knew.</p>
<p>The other thing is that the present Han Sooyoung is more believable than the Han Sooyoung I remember.</p>
<p>It gives off an indescribable atmosphere.</p>
<p>It felt like facing some kind of great person.</p>
<p>"Don’t you need to introduce yourself?"</p>
<p>"I am-"</p>
<p>"I know who you are, Cheon Inho. No..."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung slightly tilted her head.</p>
<p>"The author of the ‘Omniscient Reader’ of planetary system Z865123."</p>
<p>I unknowingly clenched my fist.</p>
<p>"How did you know?"</p>
<p>"You keep stealing the items I wanted. How could I not know? As for if you’re a reader or a writer... The way you behave is a bit different from the reader's."</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sooyoung smiling, my fists lost their strength.</p>
<p>"You’re good on your own, right? I guess you read intently…"</p>
<p>'Read intently', those words stuck in my ears like thorns.</p>
<p>"It seems that other guys besides you do it quite a bit… You can’t even compare to the 'prophets' of our world line."</p>
<p>A face that seems to know everything.</p>
<p>There was no hostility in Han Sooyoung's tone. Rather, it was a tone that seemed to encourage me from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>"I guess the novel sold quite well in that world line? In some world lines, it was completely ruined."</p>
<p>"The reaction wasn't bad. It was a success."</p>
<p>"Okay?"</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung smiled lightly.</p>
<p>"I'm glad."</p>
<p>What is it that makes you happy?</p>
<p>I giggled and said.</p>
<p>"Until I met you, I thought I wrote the whole story."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung looked at me with regret.</p>
<p>"Okay. But I wrote it."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but admit it.</p>
<p>The tale that ran through her body spoke.</p>
<p>That person is real.</p>
<p>It’s not me who wrote it, it's that person.</p>
<p>"If you wrote a story, you know. All the sentences you came up with are from the cloud."</p>
<p>"The sentences in the cloud were passed on in the form of inspiration. I believed it was my idea."</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>Really. Did I really not write a single sentence in this world?</p>
<p>As if dismissing the question, the original author of the story said.</p>
<p>"So, just stop here and get out of here."</p>
<p>Before I could even walk, one of my knees felt bent.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I felt a strange sense of relief.</p>
<p>"You don't have to take responsibility. I'll do the rest. Stop down and rest."</p>
<p>Why do I believe in these words and want to quit everything?</p>
<p>I stumbled and asked.</p>
<p>"Doing something… what do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Are you a writer too?"</p>
<p>As if she didn't already know the answer, Han Sooyoung asked.</p>
<p>Her vague premonition came to a certainty, and her fingertips trembled anxiously.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung spoke as if driven by a premonition.</p>
<p>"The end of this turn has already been decided. I'm just trying to speed it up a little."</p>
<p>The 'end of the 41st turn' I remember flashed through my mind.</p>
<p>「The bequest power using the 'absolute throne' fails to proceed with the scenario.」</p>
<p>「After losing all his comrades, he contracts with a demon to send 'Shin Yoosung' to the world line of the past.」</p>
<p>「Shin Yoosung' wandered around the world for over a thousand years.」</p>
<p>「She descended as the 'Disaster of Floods' in the world line of the past.」</p>
<p>At the end of this story, nothing good came of it.</p>
<p>It was such a world in the first place.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung said as if to comfort me.</p>
<p>"No need to continue, no need to be sad. There are just stories like that."</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>This world was already over.</p>
<p>Through the conclusion of the 41st turn, the next incident has already 'occurred' and the 'end of the incident' must be fixed.</p>
<p>Only then, for the first time, does『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』 begin.</p>
<p>I understood that too.</p>
<p>I understood, so I didn't understand.</p>
<p>"Then why were we called to this worldline?"</p>
<p>It was unfair.</p>
<p>Clearly 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』, the story written by Han Sooyoung is correct.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>"Ordinary people were suddenly summoned to this worldline and had to fight for their lives."</p>
<p>Can I say that all the moments that I and the readers endured in this world are also her sentences?</p>
<p>"Fighting monsters you've never seen before, struggling to get food, killing others to survive."</p>
<p>I thought there must be a reason we came here.</p>
<p>It's just that we weren't chosen by chance. I believed that there must be a tie in which we, as we ought, must contribute to this story.</p>
<p>"Not only me, but everyone along with me did that. So I think we deserve to know why."</p>
<p>I thought of doing squats Kyung Sein in the corner of Geumho Station, and I remembered Dansu Ahjussi, who had nightmares calling his daughter's name.</p>
<p>I thought of the Killer King left in the movie to send me upstairs, and I thought of Literature Girl 64 who believed in such a Killer King and helped me.</p>
<p>All of them were possessing readers in this place just because they had read the Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>"There are even people who have been brought here and died."</p>
<p>"They’re not dead. You know."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung sighed lightly and added a word.</p>
<p>"They just returned to being 'Fragments of Kim Dokja'. They are back to their original form."</p>
<p>"They are no longer Kim Dokja. They are people who have already lived in another world. They each had their own lives."</p>
<p>"You called us."</p>
<p>"I didn’t call you?"</p>
<p>Of course, it was 'RepresentativeKimDokja' who kidnapped us, not Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p>However, can we really say that Han Sooyoung is irrelevant?</p>
<p>"I saw a video of you."</p>
<p>"A video of me?"</p>
<p>"Didn't you say, 'So far it's just a taster. A side story will start soon'?"</p>
<p>The memory of the theater where &lt;Kim Dokja's Banquet&gt; was held was still clear.</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja, who kidnapped us, played a video of Han Sooyoung on the screen.</p>
<p>"I don’t know what you mean?"</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung narrowed her eyes, as if she didn't understand.</p>
<p>"I've never done anything like that. What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>Looking at her expression, it seems that the video was not Han Sooyoung herself.</p>
<p>If so, did someone disguise themselves as Han Sooyoung?</p>
<p>It wasn't impossible.</p>
<p>Because RepresentativeKimDokja had the 'Ever-changing Stealth Suit'.</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja knew information about Kim Dokja and 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint', so it would not have been impossible to imitate Han Sooyoung's tone.</p>
<p>But there were still unanswered questions.</p>
<p>"Then you have nothing to do with us coming here?"</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung hesitated for the first time.</p>
<p>"I may not be completely irrelevant, but... Anyway, I wasn't the one who called you to this world line. I didn't mean to."</p>
<p>"Then why are you here?"</p>
<p>As Han Sooyoung said, this story has already ended. Those words were more applicable to Han Sooyoung than anyone else.</p>
<p>"『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』 is a story that has already ended. Why did you come back to this story?"</p>
<p>Countless universes bloomed and lost to complete a story.</p>
<p>There have been countless tragedies, and they have seen the end. The world line is closed.</p>
<p>Originally, she shouldn't have been able to come here now.</p>
<p>"I am."</p>
<br/>
<p>Han Sooyoung's eyes shook. For the first time, agitation rose up in the expression of the author.</p>
<p>"I am a Kim Dokja-"</p>
<p>Sparks exploded all over her body with a sound like tsutsutsuchut.</p>
<p>An aftermath of probability.</p>
<p>The reason was simple.</p>
<p>「That's information she can't mention.」</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung's expression hardened. She looked down at the sparks running through her hand and said in a much cooler tone.</p>
<p>"I am under no obligation to tell you the details."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute."</p>
<p>"Hey."</p>
<p>I felt my blood run cold.</p>
<p>"I am really tired right now?"</p>
<p>Both of her eyes were staring at me.</p>
<p>"Do you know what I went through to get here?"</p>
<p>Seeing the cool emotion in those eyes, I took a step back without realizing it.</p>
<p>"I feel sorry for you, too. I feel bad for being called to a place like this, and do you think I haven’t experienced a scenario? I’ll find a way too, so just stay still for now."</p>
<p>I felt overwhelmed just by hearing the story.</p>
<p>It was as she said.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung was someone who had already experienced scenarios. Even at the end of the scenario, a person who has reached it twice.</p>
<p>She said that no matter how much I and the readers knew about her story, there was no way we could do better than she did.</p>
<p>「Wouldn’t it be wise for me to entrust everything to Han Sooyoung?」</p>
<p>A weak thought appeared in my mind.</p>
<p>If you think about it, even when I first possessed this world, wasn't I thinking of meeting and relying on Kim Dokja or Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
<p>Even if it changes to Han Sooyoung, nothing will change.</p>
<p>So even now, I want to believe in her and quit.</p>
<p>How many steps did I take back without even realizing it? I felt something touch my back.</p>
<p>When I turned around, Yoo Joonghyuk was standing there.</p>
<p>I stared blankly at Yoo Joonghyuk's still hardened face.</p>
<p>And at that moment.</p>
<p>「What I want to protect.」</p>
<p>I heard the story of Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, who is not the Yoo Joonghyuk of the Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint I know, nor Yoo Joonghyuk of the Ways of Survival read by Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>「Do I still have something I want to protect?」</p>
<p>I could tell just by looking at his face.</p>
<p>[The character Yoo Joonghyuk is suffering from 'regression depression'.]</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung's method of overpowering Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>She wrote the method used by Kim Dokja in the 1863rd turn.</p>
<p>"You mean you’re going to do something like this?"</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to me, something suddenly soared inside me.</p>
<p>I couldn't stop talking, wondering if I deserved to say that.</p>
<p>"Isn’t this Yoo Joonghyuk doing nothing wrong?"</p>
<p>"I would have told you not to mind."</p>
<p>I also wanted to believe in Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p>However, I couldn't understand Han Sooyoung's current behavior to just ignore it.</p>
<p>Why didn't Han Sooyoung kill the Theater Owner?</p>
<p>[Your exclusive attribute effect is activated!]</p>
<p>Why did Han Sooyoung subdue Yoo Joonghyuk here?</p>
<p>I looked at the simulation controlled by Han Sooyoung and Yoo Joonghyuk connected through the Theater Owner.</p>
<p>「"Kim Namwoon, you can't follow me with that kind of effort."」</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk was dreaming.</p>
<p>「"Lee Hyunsung. Sometimes think for yourself, act and decide."」</p>
<p>Even in his dreams, he was carrying out the scenarios with the determination to die.</p>
<p>「"Stand back, Lee Jihye. From here on out, I'm in charge."」</p>
<p>Losing colleagues and failing the scenario.</p>
<p>Not knowing that all the stories were false, Yoo Joonghyuk struggled.</p>
<p>Perhaps Yoo Joonghyuk will not be able to see the 'end' of the 41st turn in the future.</p>
<p>The moment I thought that far, I knew Han Sooyoung's plan.</p>
<p>In this world, there were too many variables that would hinder the 'end of the 41st turn'.</p>
<p>Me. Readers. And even Yoo Joonghyuk, who has abnormal power compared to the when reading the main story.</p>
<p>What if there was a way to remove all those variables at once?</p>
<p>"You're not going to clear this theater dungeon."</p>
