<hr/>
<p>[You have hunted a 'Disaster' for the first time in the scenario.]</p>
<p>[You have achieved something no one else has achieved.]</p>
<p>[Payment of compensation related to the scenario is being delayed.]</p>
<p>[Payment of core rewards is determined based on contribution.]</p>
<p>[10,000 coins were obtained.]</p>
<p>Killer King, Ja Yerin, Lee Dansu, and the others looked blankly at the messages pouring out of the air.</p>
<p>[The reward for defeating 'Labyrinth Sentinel' has been obtained.]</p>
<p>[You have won 10,000 coins.]</p>
<p>[You have achieved a non-existent achievement!]</p>
<p>[Many constellations admire your achievements!]</p>
<p>[Someone recommended your story to the &lt;Star Stream&gt;]</p>
<p>In only the fourth scenario, they achieved the feat of defeating both level 5 and level 6 species.</p>
<p>Each person's contribution was different, but the reward was greater than any other scenario so far.</p>
<p>But no one in the group was happy about that.</p>
<p>"What is Cheon Inho’s condition?"</p>
<p>"Not good."</p>
<p>Yerin, who had taken a look at Cheon Inho, shook her head.</p>
<p>Killer King looked down at Cheon Inho, who was still unconscious, and saw the poisonous dragon species fall.</p>
<p>He recalled the last moments.</p>
<p>"If it weren’t for this guy, everyone would have died."</p>
<p>He could never have imagined that Cheon Inho would appear there. With a body that didn't even seem to have regained consciousness, Cheon Inho ran straight towards the dragon and ripped out its heart.</p>
<p>If it weren't for the woman who is taking care of Cheon Inho on the floor right now, Cheon Inho would have died.</p>
<p>Cheon Inho's face, poisoned by the poison of the poisonous dragon species, was the color of earth.</p>
<p>"Do you have any medicine?"</p>
<p>In order to neutralize Cheon Inho's poison, the party shook out all the elixirs they had. Although it was not a summoning level elixir, it was still a high quality medicine.</p>
<p>In addition, the core of the 'venomous dragon species' that just died.</p>
<p>The woman gathered her medicinal herbs, poured them into Cheon Inho's mouth, and cast a strange spell.</p>
<p>After a while, something like a small gold frame appeared on Cheon Inho's head, and his complexion began to improve.</p>
<p>Killer King asked.</p>
<p>"Do you know Cheon Inho?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>The woman who suddenly appeared was not only the person who saved Cheon Inho, but said that she knew Cheon Inho.</p>
<p>Even though the situation was sufficiently strange to raise suspicion, Killer King did not bother to question it.</p>
<p>Because there were more urgent problems than that right now.</p>
<p>[The final king's qualifications will soon begin.]</p>
<p>Qualifications of the last king.</p>
<p>The main stage of 'Battle for the Throne' was finally upon them.</p>
<p>"We need the Death Sword."</p>
<p>'Death Sword' that can only be obtained by collecting seven star jewels.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, all seven jewels were gathered here now.</p>
<p>The problem is that, unlike the original story, the person who collects seven jewels is swept away by [madness] and becomes a monster.</p>
<p>Ja Yerin said as if holding back.</p>
<p>"It’s still dangerous. "I don’t know what will happen if he absorbs all seven star gems."</p>
<p>"I guess so."</p>
<p>Killer King looked down at the fallen Cheon Inho for a moment.</p>
<p>Cheon Inho risked his life to save them. But will he use Cheon Inho as a sacrifice to obtain the 'Death Sword'?</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk doesn’t do such cowardly things."</p>
<p>Lee Dansu sighed in relief, and Ja Yerin, who looked nervous, also stepped away.</p>
<p>But the crisis started now.</p>
<p>[The Last King's Qualifications begins.]</p>
<p>Killer King's expression hardened at the message coming from the air.</p>
<p>"It has begun."</p>
<p>The stage for 'Last Qualifications' had already opened.</p>
<p>Killer King looked back at Lee Dansu and said.</p>
<p>"I’m leaving without the Death Sword. All we have to do is somehow block Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p>Behind the destruction of the 41st round of the original story was the ‘absolute throne'.</p>
<p>"It would be the best if we could destroy the throne with the Death Sword, but even if it’s not the best, there’s no need to despair."</p>
<p>Even if they don't have the Death Sword, all they have to do is prevent anyone from taking the 'absolute throne'.</p>
<p>"We just have to hold out until the scenario changes. It prevents anyone from sitting on the throne."</p>
<p>Is the &lt;Star Stream&gt; looking for fun? There is a tendency to move towards more 'plausible' stories.</p>
<p>So as long as they make the scenario interesting, they will have a chance.</p>
<p>"Brother, the coins are…”</p>
<p>"I’ve collected enough."</p>
<p>"Take mine too."</p>
<p>To defeat Yoo Joonghyuk in 'The Last Qualification', you must use the method that Kim Dokja used.</p>
<p>And that method required a huge amount of coins.</p>
<p>Lee Dansu, who was watching the scene, asked.</p>
<p>"Isn’t Yerin the king?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then..."</p>
<p>Killer King, who received Ja Yerin's gaze, responded.</p>
<p>"I am the king."</p>
<p>"Is that so."</p>
<p>"Immortal King. Are you curious about what kind of king I am?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>Lee Dansu asked back blankly. He didn't know what to say, so he just muttered, but Killer King answered as he pleased.</p>
<p>"I am the 'Lonely King'."</p>
<p>"Lonely..."</p>
<p>Lee Dansu wondered if he had heard wrong. Come to think of it, when he was choosing the 'King Options', he remembered seeing an option with that name.</p>
<p>But he didn't know that there would be someone who would bother to choose a name like that.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' shakes his head.]</p>
<p>Even Ja Yerin secretly turned her head.</p>
<p>Killer King continued speaking with a shameless expression, as if he did not really understand such a reaction.</p>
<p>"If you include you, me, and Ye Hyunwoo outside, there are a total of three 'kings' who can attend the final stage. It would have been better if Cheon Inho was also here."</p>
<p>Cheon Inho, who fell to the floor, showed no signs of regaining consciousness.</p>
<p>In fact, just being alive was a miracle.</p>
<p>"For now, we have no choice but to try it on our own."</p>
<p>[Qualified kings move to the final battlefield’s location.]</p>
<p>That's right. The summoning was beginning with a sound.</p>
<p>Sparks flew through the bodies of Killer King and Lee Dansu.</p>
<p>"Yerin, please take care of Cheon Inho."</p>
<p>"Don't worry."</p>
<p>Killer King looked back at the woman one last time. The woman was still reciting her spell with her hand placed on Cheon Inho's forehead. That spell seemed to be suppressing Cheon Inho’s [Madness].</p>
<p>Killer King spoke to that woman.</p>
<p>"7942."</p>
<p>Then the woman slowly opened her eyes and answered.</p>
<p>"9158."</p>
<p>"You remember it well."</p>
<p>"Of course. This is the password I created."</p>
<p>Killer King nodded his head.</p>
<p>"First Apostle, are you going to participate in the war?"</p>
<p>Then the first apostle shook her head.</p>
<p>Killer King looked at the first apostle as if he was surprised, then turned his back and said.</p>
<p>"When Cheon Inho wakes up, tell him. I will protect this world."</p>
<hr/>
<p>In my hazy consciousness, I had a dream.</p>
<p>「"Author, but…"」</p>
<p>I realized it the moment I heard the voice.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>This is Ji Eunyu’s dream.</p>
<p>「"Yes."」</p>
<p>The me in the dream answered.</p>
<p>I was afraid of what Ji Eunyu would say, and I was also looking forward to it.</p>
<p>「"In the last scene, Kim Dokja came back."」</p>
<p>Last scene.</p>
<p>I immediately realized what Ji Eunyu was talking about.</p>
<p>The moment the door to the hospital room opens and Han Sooyoung and Yoo Joonghyuk return. At the moment when the readers who had become 'the oldest dream' were wishing for Kim Dokja's resurrection, Ji Eunyu was talking about that last scene.</p>
<p>I cautiously opened my mouth, looking around in case anyone heard me.</p>
<p>「"He’s back. You don't know that, it's an open ending."」</p>
<p>Then Ji Eunyu frowned.</p>
<p>「"Do you really think so?"」</p>
<p>「"It has to be an open ending to increase the level of completion-"」</p>
<p>「"I don’t think the author has anything to say about the degree of completion."」</p>
<p>I thought for a moment and then hesitated.</p>
<p>「"To leave a deep impression on readers, like a spinning top that seems to never stop..."」</p>
<p>「"Would you like to get your head stuck with a top?"」</p>
<p>I frowned as I watched Ji Eunyu’s fist spinning like a top.</p>
<p>「"I don't know. Han Sooyoung wrote it. Ask Han Sooyoung."」</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu sighed lightly while looking at me and said.</p>
<p>「"Great. Let me ask you this. What if the author is the reader? What do you think when you see the last scene? Has Kim Dokja returned?"」</p>
<p>If I were a reader.</p>
<p>Actually, there is no need to ask that.</p>
<p>Because all the sentences in the last chapter refer to a single sentence that is not written down.</p>
<p>A puzzle with only one empty piece.</p>
<p>A unique non-existent sentence stands out more than any other sentence that exists.</p>
<p>「"Maybe he didn’t come back?"」</p>
<p>「"You will say that right away."」</p>
<p>「"Don’t go somewhere else and say I did that."」</p>
<p>「"Why did I do that? Rather, in what form did Kim Dokja return?"」</p>
<p>What shape is it?</p>
<p>「"That’s the ending. There are countless Kim Dokjas scattered throughout the universe, and isn’t it because their wishes came true that Kim Dokja came back to life?"」</p>
<p>Hearing it from someone else's mouth, it somehow feels like the ending of a children's fairy tale.</p>
<p>「"I guess so?"」</p>
<p>「"Then there must have been Kim Dokjas who each had their own thoughts. What would happen if those readers thought at the same time, 'Dokja Kim is back'?"」</p>
<p>「"Uh..."」</p>
<p>I hadn't thought of that.</p>
<p>I felt scared for a moment and asked.</p>
<p>「"Maybe I should write it again?"」</p>
<p>The moment I blinked and thought, "Please, I can’t do that," the scenery around me changed.</p>
<p>A ceiling blocked by a familiar stone wall.</p>
<p>The dimly shining light.</p>
<p>With the feeling of the floor, all the memories slowly came back.</p>
<p>Memories of entering the labyrinth to find the 'Death Sword'.</p>
<p>There, Killer King and others met Dansu ahjussi, absorbed the Star Jewels, a disaster was summoned, and the Labyrinth Watcher died...</p>
<p>I almost died too.</p>
<p>As my thoughts reached that point, someone suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu.</p>
<p>[Currently you have acquired a total of 6 Star Jewels.]</p>
<p>[The power of the 'Star Jewel' erodes your body.]</p>
<p>[The 6th level of madness is encroaching on you.]</p>
<p>[An unknown force is suppressing your 'madness'.]</p>
<p>[An unknown force is interfering with the erosion of the 'Star Jewels'.]</p>
<p>I slowly got up. I felt a throbbing pain as if someone was squeezing my head.</p>
<p>There was no one around.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Clearly, the disaster and the watchman have fallen.</p>
<p>Where have the other party members gone?</p>
<p>What happened to the scenario?</p>
<p>[The owner of 'Absolute Throne' has been chosen.]</p>
<p>At the momentary system message, I blinked blankly.</p>
<p>I thought I heard wrong.</p>
<p>'The owner of the absolute throne has been identified?'</p>
<p>The information in my head was sorted in an instant.</p>
<p>The owner of the throne has been decided. That means the 'fight for the throne' has already begun and is over.</p>
<p>「The fourth scenario has ended.」</p>
<p>I looked at the small star gem rolling around on the floor.</p>
<p>I have six star gems. And there's one rolling around over there.</p>
<p>「There is no Death Sword in this round.」</p>
<p>My fingertips were shaking. Something that shouldn't have happened happened.</p>
<p>I felt the dungeon vibrating.</p>
<p>I felt sick. I knew it instinctively. Something sinister is about to be born in this world.</p>
<p>[The owner of the 'absolute throne' is...]</p>
<p>A light came on in the distance and I heard someone running towards me.</p>
<p>[It is 'Incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p>
<p>The destruction of the 41st round was decided.</p>
