<hr/>
<p>My body was shaking without me knowing.</p>
<p>The only thought that dominated my mind was to immediately slaughter the demons in front of me and steal their spear.</p>
<p>What stopped me was the [Transmission] that came to my ear.</p>
<p>—Author.</p>
<p>When I looked back in shock, I saw Ji Eunyu curled up like me.</p>
<p>—Stay still.</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu shook her head desperately and added.</p>
<p>—I know it’s Yoo Joonghyuk’s spear. But that’s Yoo Joonghyuk’s 'lost spear'.</p>
<p>Belatedly, the series of events that had occurred so far came to mind one after another.</p>
<p>From the moment he first entered the 'Recycling Center', Yoo Joonghyuk had lost all of his items. The 'battle boots' he was wearing right now were from the 'Zodiac Race' prize.</p>
<p>—The 'Master of the Spear' that that high-ranking demon dealt with must be someone else.</p>
<p>What Ji Eunyu said was right.</p>
<p>I managed to sigh and calm down my boiling anger.</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu’s soft palm was placed on my shoulder.</p>
<p>—Why is the writer acting so uncharacteristically? Did you have any abnormal condition?</p>
<p>I don't know either.</p>
<p>Maybe I unconsciously felt indebted to Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because I promised to write his story.</p>
<p>I caught a glimpse of the story and only responded with the shape of my mouth.</p>
<p>I said, 'I guess I just lost my mind for a moment. Thank you!'</p>
<p>—You know you can never win now, right?</p>
<p>'I know.'</p>
<p>Again, it would have been suicidal to engage in an all-out war with the upper-class demons possessed by the 'Gourmet Association'. At the very least, it would be nice to have an item exclusive to 『Infinite Prison Guard』.</p>
<p>[Hmm?]</p>
<p>Just then, a high-level demon turned his head and began to approach this way.</p>
<p>Cold sweat formed down my back.</p>
<p>When I looked to the side, Ji Eunyu also had a hardened expression.</p>
<p>I thought about the number of times [Smoke Man] could be used in my head.</p>
<p>Should I burn ‘Mana Tobacco’ right now? If I attract attention, will I be able to buy Ji Eunyu time to run away?</p>
<p>The moment he approached us right in front of us.</p>
<p>[Hey, a large fragment was detected.]</p>
<p>The voice of another high-ranking demon holding the Wolgeuk was heard.</p>
<p>The demon, whose expression changed, turned around and asked.</p>
<p>[Which one?]</p>
<p>[West.]</p>
<p>[Let’s go right away, it might be that guy called 'Kim Dokja'.]</p>
<p>Only after they disappeared did we manage to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu touched her chest and opened her mouth.</p>
<p>"I was surprised because I thought they were coming for us."</p>
<p>"It’s not a safe situation yet."</p>
<p>"Why? I think they’ve gone far enough—"</p>
<p>"Those guys must have gone to other students."</p>
<p>In this scenario, the characters who can be called 'big fragments' are determined.</p>
<p>Currently, the expected number of people is two.</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu nodded and said as if she knew who those two were.</p>
<p>"It would be Gu Seonah or Ye Hyunwoo."</p>
<p>"Maybe so."</p>
<p>"You’re not planning on going to rescue them, are you?"</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>"Writer."</p>
<p>[The world view is looking at you.]</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu, startled by the faint spark, changed her conversation back to [Transmission].</p>
<p>—I forgot. You can just answer with your mouth. Because I have the [Lip Reading] skill.</p>
<p>When I nodded, Ji Eunyu continued speaking.</p>
<p>—Right now, finding one reader is not the problem. And Goo Seonah and Ye Hyunwoo are not people who share the same views as us.</p>
<p>'They are also ordinary readers.'</p>
<p>—There is no way ordinary readers would have collected so many 'Kim Dokja fragments'.</p>
<p>'That.'</p>
<p>I was about to say something when I suddenly raised my head and looked at Ji Eunyu.</p>
<p>Fragments of Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>Have I ever told Ji Eunyu any details about it?</p>
<p>—How could I not know when the situation has come to this point?</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu sighed lightly and continued.</p>
<p>—I heard it a little bit from Meihouwang. It is said that fragments of the 'Oldest Dream' are scattered throughout this world.</p>
<p>Meihouwang. Certainly, for a constellation of that level, it would not be strange to know the story about the 'Kim Dokja Fragments'.</p>
<p>—Are you also collecting the fragments?</p>
<p>I hesitated and nodded. There was no reason to lie to Ji Eunyu here. However, when the truth was revealed, a slight fear arose.</p>
<p>—Why are you doing that?</p>
<p>'That is...?'</p>
<p>—Isn’t that the only way to bring Kim Dokja back to life if we collect them?</p>
<p>'Do you know how to obtain Kim Dokja Fragments?'</p>
<p>—It’s not like the author is going around killing readers to collect their souls. Didn't you collect the dead readers or kill and collect the monsters that ate the readers?</p>
<p>When I nodded, Ji Eunyu added as if she knew that would happen.</p>
<p>—Then there is no problem. They say the more you collect, the stronger you become? Because it's safer to be in the hands of the author than to be in the hands of bad people.</p>
<p>Those were words of gratitude. These were words of gratitude, so I couldn't say thank you carelessly.</p>
<p>—Because I know what kind of person the author is. However, if other readers are collecting, the story is a little different.</p>
<p>'Those people are not ones who would kill someone to collect their fragments.'</p>
<p>—Author. You haven't forgotten what the 'first scenario' we experienced is, right?</p>
<p>'…'</p>
<p>—I know the author trusts his readers, but those who have survived so far have experienced at least one murder. The same goes for me.</p>
<p>I know. Of those who have survived so far, no one has survived unscathed.</p>
<p>However, just because someone committed a certain sin, I did not want to judge their entire person based on that sin alone.</p>
<p>'The people I saw, Ye Hyunwoo and Goo Seonah, were never bad people.'</p>
<p>I thought of the little readers I saw in Asmodeus's 'Theater'.</p>
<p>'They're just people who like novels.'</p>
<p>Pure eyes gathered in one place just because they were curious about the next story.</p>
<p>'If it weren't for them, I wouldn't have been able to pay the overdue rent for a single room. I wouldn't have been able to eat regular meals, and I wouldn't have been able to continue writing. I wouldn't have been able to continue my dream. I wouldn't have been able to write Han Sooyoung's manuscript. Therefore—'</p>
<p>I owe them my life.</p>
<p>'I will save those people.'</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu looked at me like that and pursed her lips several times before sighing deeply.</p>
<p>—If you say so, I also received a salary from them.</p>
<p>'Then there's another reason to save them.'</p>
<p>—You’re not going right away, are you?</p>
<p>There is a reason why I chose this route.</p>
<p>'This route?'</p>
<p>—You need to find 'Rotania’s sword hilt' and 'Bilton’s scabbard'.</p>
<p>I was dazed for a moment and then asked.</p>
<p>'How does the editor know that?'</p>
<p>—Isn’t it more weird that I don’t know?</p>
<p>'Have you read 'Infinite Prison Guard'? But that was written before I signed a contract with the editor.'</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu shot back with a slightly red face, probably because she was angry.</p>
<p>—Of course I saw it all. What editor doesn’t read novels written by contracted writers?</p>
<p>As I was rummaging through the nearby forest with a grumpy Ji Eunyu, I found a tree trunk with an unfamiliar mark engraved on it.</p>
<p>We exchanged looks and started digging under the tree trunk.</p>
<p>How much dirt was dug up like that?</p>
<p>We found an old skeleton arm and the broken hilt of the sword it held.</p>
<p>'The hilt of Saint Lotania.'</p>
<p>A weapon used by graduates of the 'Filia Hunter Academy' in the past.</p>
<p>As expected, it was buried exactly where I had written it down.</p>
<p>"It only has a handle. I guess someone took the sheath."</p>
<p>"Let’s take this with us."</p>
<p>The final combination item that can be obtained from 'Ma Hyunsung Farming Route A' is 'Holy Sword Raven Ringer'.</p>
<p>The Raven Ringer was an item with 'holy attributes' that was absolutely necessary to deal with the Great Demon.</p>
<p>We grabbed the hilt of our swords and moved straight toward the direction where the high-level demons had disappeared.</p>
<p>While we were moving, Ji Eunyu and I had a short chat about what happened so far.</p>
<p>—Who knew that I would have to wear a school uniform again?</p>
<p>'That's right.'</p>
<p>—It suits the writer well.</p>
<p>'I guess it suits Cheon Inho better, not me.'</p>
<p>—The face is the author’s.</p>
<p>We also exchanged information about the Chinese Zodiac belonging to each class.</p>
<p>—You fought with incarnations of rats, snakes, and dogs?</p>
<p>'To be exact, I didn't fight, but the Gourmet Association wiped them out.'</p>
<p>—Well, it turned out that way too. But my forces… So, I don’t think the monkeys are particularly interested in this scenario. In the first place, I think Meihouwang applied to participate just because he was bored.</p>
<p>But. Not everyone in the Chinese zodiac is serious about this ball.</p>
<p>In particular, the 'Monkey' faction does not have any merit in participating in the 'Zodiac Ball'. Even from the Recycling Center's perspective, it will be difficult if the constellation Son Wukong descends directly...</p>
<p>—But other &lt;zodiac signs&gt; will have a slightly different stance. Especially the guys who attacked the author. And the 'tiger' and 'cow' sides seemed sincere.</p>
<p>I guess so.</p>
<p>The status of those who have been eliminated by me in previous scenarios, such as tigers, rats, and snakes, has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>In this scenario, unless we somehow make up for it, our existence as a constellation will be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>'The same goes for the Gourmet Association guys.'</p>
<p>The Gourmet Association will be watching the struggles of such great constellations.</p>
<p>The fact that they participated in the scenario as 'high-level demons' probably means that they are prepared to end this scenario in a tragedy.</p>
<p>Of course, as long as I'm around, things won't go as they think.</p>
<p>"Ji Eunyu."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>We stopped at the signal and hid ourselves among the surrounding bushes.</p>
<p>The sound of the surrounding forest being torn apart.</p>
<p>The sharp crackling sound of a weapon was heard through the red burning leaves.</p>
<p>Someone was fighting nearby.</p>
<p>However, the surge of magical energy felt every time a single clatter sounded was unusual.</p>
<p>"Stop it."</p>
<p>A cold voice heard through the thick bloody smell.</p>
<p>"You must be Goo Seonah."</p>
<p>Together with Ji Eunyu, I quickly grasped the situation.</p>
<p>The student council president, Goo Seonah, has her arms crossed with her back to the forest. And there were members of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; who built defenses as if to protect her.</p>
<p>Lee Hyunsung, Kim Namwoon, Lee Jihye, Shin Yoosoung, and even Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>As expected, the ones putting pressure on them were the two high-ranking demons who had attacked us earlier.</p>
<p>[A lot of delicious-looking guys have gathered.]</p>
<p>The high-level demons, all drooling, rushed forward while simultaneously releasing their attacks.</p>
<p>I wanted to shout at them to run away right away. No, even if I didn't shout, if they felt the intensity of those 'high-level demons' unleashing, they should have run away.</p>
<p>But they didn't run away.</p>
<p>Kaaaaang!</p>
<p>The pitch-black blade wielded by a high-level demon collided with white light and bounced off.</p>
<p>Looking closely, I saw that Goo Seonah and her group were all wearing silver-shining armor and greaves.</p>
<p>I immediately recognized what the item was.</p>
<p>'Holy Messenger Set.'</p>
<p>Anti-Asmodian standard equipment that can be obtained from 'Ma Hyunsung’s Farming D Route'.</p>
<p>I was already wondering how they got that—</p>
<p>[Currently, the 『Infinite Prison Guard』 collaboration item is being sold in the 'Dokkaebi Bag'.]</p>
<p>I opened the 'Dokkaebi Bag' with a feeling of wonder.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>* Holy Messenger Set — In Stock 0</p>
</fieldset>
<p>It was absurd.</p>
<p>No, does this make sense now?</p>
<fieldset>
<p>…</p>
<p>* Commercial flare — 1</p>
<p>* Top quality holy water — 2</p>
<p>* Holy Sword Light Wish — Inventory 0</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Even Light Wish, which was considered the famous sword of 'Filia Hunter Academy' along with the holy sword 'Raybringer', was sold.</p>
<p>I belatedly looked through the list to purchase the items I needed. But unfortunately, cost-effective items were almost sold out.</p>
<p>The items that were still in stock were at such exorbitant prices that I couldn't afford them at the moment.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn't mean that I can't buy it if I decide to do so, but as the incarnation of the 'Demon King of Salvation', the price is simply unbearable.</p>
<p>"We got hit."</p>
<p>I never thought I would be stabbed in the back like this.</p>
<p>I can't believe the damn dokkaebis would have released related items as products. It was a carelessness caused by my arrogance of knowing the worldview.</p>
<p>Even the holy sword in question, 'Light Wish', was held in the hands of student council president Goo Seonah.</p>
<p>[The item 'Light Wish' increases the morale of the party.]</p>
<p>From 'Holy Messenger Set' to 'Light Wish'. It was definitely a combination that could deal with even high-level demons.</p>
<p>It was unfair. No, what am I supposed to do for a living if I am already at a disadvantage and am deprived of privileges as the original author like this?</p>
<p>If the worldview was illegally stolen and all the items were taken away—</p>
<p>[Someone has purchased a 'collaboration item'.]</p>
<p>[The 'original work usage fee' has been paid to you.]</p>
<p>There is no benefit to the original author...</p>
<p>[Someone has purchased a 'collaboration item'.]</p>
<p>[The 'original work usage fee' has been paid to you.]</p>
<p>I quietly glared at the message that appeared before my eyes.</p>
<p>[Someone has purchased a 'collaboration item'.]</p>
<p>[The 'original work usage fee' has been paid to you.]</p>
<p>No matter how many times I rubbed my eyes and checked, it was the same.</p>
<p>It was definitely true.</p>
<p>[The 'original work usage fee' has been paid to you.]</p>
<p>I thought as I opened the 'dokkaebi bag' once again.</p>
<p>[Would you like to check the 'original work usage fee' deposited?]</p>
<p>How much was that item from earlier?</p>
