<hr/>
<p>The old stories that choked Han Sooyoung were talking.</p>
<p>The sentences you write end here.</p>
<p>You are no longer the author of this story.</p>
<p>Did you know that you would be able to reach an end even if you forgot about us?</p>
<p>[Looks like you can hear those words now.]</p>
<p>These stories of another world were all sentences written by her at one time.</p>
<p>Forgotten sentences.</p>
<p>Fragments of a story created by the words of promises that were not kept.</p>
<p>Like babies searching for their mother, forgotten stories burrowed into her throat.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung activated her magic.</p>
<p>If she couldn't use her 'Giant story', her first priority was to somehow escape.</p>
<p>Fortunately for her, she had one skill that suited her.</p>
<p>Her specialty is that she is a writer.</p>
<p>Even when she was struck by an unexpected blow while trying to stop the fight between Kim Dokja and Yoo Joonghyuk, she survived thanks to this skill.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>[Do you want to use an avatar?]</p>
<p>One of the "Hell's Sentinels" rose completely from its seat, and then took on a human appearance.</p>
<p>He took out a sword from his lofty arms covered in black robes.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung immediately recognized the item.</p>
<p>'Criminal Disaster Sword'.</p>
<p>The constellation engraved on the death sword burned brightly. It was the man who manifested the authority of the 'Sword of Death' in his own story.</p>
<p>The moment his sword's trajectory cut through the air, Han Sooyoung was overcome with pain as if her mind was being split in half.</p>
<p>'Cut off.'</p>
<p>The link with the dummy [Avatar] that she had maintained all along was broken.</p>
<p>The Power of the Death Sword. The power that cuts the ties of her horoscope cut the ties between her and [Avatar].</p>
<p>In this case, it is impossible to escape using [Avatar's Memory Transfer].</p>
<p>If she dies here, she will really die.</p>
<p>[You will die here.]</p>
<p>For the first time, cold sweat hit Han Sooyoung's forehead.</p>
<p>She was strong, meticulous, and cunning.</p>
<p>If it had been the period when she had just entered the 41st turn, she would not have suffered so badly.</p>
<p>But now she had used too many stories.</p>
<p>「If she hadn't met him. If she hadn't wasted the story to bring him back to life... Is she regretting it so much?」</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung's lips tingled.</p>
<p>[You couldn't have abandoned him. Because he is in this world because of you. Because the ending you wanted to see ended up ruining the whole story.]</p>
<p>The power of Seolhwa exploded in Han Sooyoung's body.</p>
<p>The Giant story couldn’t be used, but that didn't mean she couldn't use her stories at all.</p>
<p>[Fable 'The False Savior' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>Blood trickled down Han Sooyoung's mouth. Her arms, which slowly regained strength, tore Seolhwa's grip on her neck.</p>
<p>Snowflakes dissipated from her breath, and the muscles all over her body were squeezed in pain.</p>
<p>Even in the midst of fainting, Han Sooyoung focused on the enemy in front of her.</p>
<p>"You...."</p>
<p>She was used to that magic that swayed in the dark.</p>
<p>An enemy who could corner her so much that she was caught off guard.</p>
<p>The ability to command demons as subordinates.</p>
<p>A deity who knows her and shares her story with &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;.</p>
<p>Even after searching through the entire universe, there were only a few such beings.</p>
<p>"I heard you were dead. How did you get here?"</p>
<p>[Are you recognizing me now?]</p>
<p>In the dark, the appearance of the Hell's Keeper began to change.</p>
<p>[Obviously I was dead. In 'The Story You Wrote'.]</p>
<p>The dog's muzzle shortened completely, and then the human face was revealed.</p>
<p>[You think you know the whole story?]</p>
<p>Taking off his robe with a white smile, he had an appearance resembling Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>[My new name is RepresentativeKimDokja. Isn't that interesting? In the story you wrote, there was no existence like this.]</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung grabbed the Unbreakable Faith that fell to the floor.</p>
<p>Along with the sound of 'Gi-i-i-i-i', the sword containing the legend spewed out brilliance.</p>
<p>She said, "I didn't write it because I didn't have to."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung’s sword strikes poured out at the running dogs.</p>
<p>"I'll kill you again."</p>
<p>She had such a feeling.</p>
<p>She must not let the guy in front of her live at all costs. Even if she and all her stories are finished here, she must kill him right here.</p>
<p>She has to do it for Kim Dokja, not for anyone else.</p>
<p>[It can't be done by you now.]</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung swung her sword without answering.</p>
<p>No matter what anyone says, she was the writer of Ways of Survival and Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.</p>
<p>She has seen the end of the scenarios twice, and  is the one who has knocked down countless stars from the sky.</p>
<p>Ha-ska!</p>
<p>The dazzling white light of long-held beliefs illuminated the darkness.</p>
<p>The second and third sword attacks continued before the devil's throat even regenerated.</p>
<p>Cut off his arms and break his legs. The fragments rolling on the floor are burned with black flames so that they cannot be reproduced.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung proceeded to thoroughly defeat the demons one by one.</p>
<p>Dogs kept appearing out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Tenacious demon dogs.</p>
<p>As if they had been trained to hunt only her all her life, the dogs gnawed at her arms and legs in sync with her movements.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Han Sooyoung was optimistic about the situation.</p>
<p>She who used her power of storytelling was also in danger, but the other side in front of her was also sacrificing his formidable probability. There was no way that the &lt;Star Stream&gt; would allow such a large amount of power to be summoned in the initial scenarios.</p>
<p>In other words, this was a game of probability, and when it came to such a fight, Han Sooyoung was confident.</p>
<p>If she holds on a little longer, the other side will lose their strength too.</p>
<p>However, no matter how much she blew the heads of the dogs that were charging at her, there was no harbinger of a probability aftermath.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Koo-goo-goo-goo!</p>
<p>Belatedly, the 'Great Hall' shimmering in the sky caught her eye.</p>
<p>Prelude to the fifth scenario.</p>
<p>The moment she saw the sparks flashing near the 'Great Hall', Han Sooyoung's hairline became soft.</p>
<p>The unknown deities on the other side of the hall shared the probability of this battle.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>Why do the 'gods of the other world' help him?</p>
<p>At that moment, a hypothesis flashed through her mind.</p>
<p>「It wasn't &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; that crossed through the world lines.」</p>
<p>Tsutsutsutsutsutsutsu!</p>
<p>The balance of the body that was barely holding on collapsed. When the power of the story was cut off, the aftermath of probability began to eat away at her as an incarnation.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung looked up at the sky resentfully.</p>
<p>No matter how much the gods of the other world helped, in the end, it was only possible with the permission of this world.</p>
<p>Everything is possible with the connivance of the stars.</p>
<p>The &lt;Star Stream&gt; of the 41st turn made the decision to exclude her who intervened in their scenario.</p>
<p>"…The &lt;Star Stream&gt; as well."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung’s arm fell, powerless, and the light of her Unbroken Faith went out.</p>
<p>'This far.'</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung does not like developments where everything flows in a pre-determined sequence. A story without surprise is obvious and lazy.</p>
<p>Her readers will soon notice that she's playing her tricks.</p>
<p>「Nevertheless, Han Soo-young couldn’t come up with a sentence to break this situation.」</p>
<p>With that, Han Sooyoung felt that she had fulfilled her role.</p>
<p>Perhaps even Kim Dokja somewhere in the sky might not be curious about the story she wrote.</p>
<p>Even in this world.</p>
<p>「"You're not trying to finish the story, you're giving up."」</p>
<p>Because there are already other writers.</p>
<p>However, thinking that the ending was right in front of her eyes, she felt regretful.</p>
<p>She might still have more sentences to write, but there must be something she couldn't say to him.</p>
<p>"Really, it's a very difficult world to be happy in."</p>
<p>Her knees bent.</p>
<p>In her last moment, Han Sooyoung moved her trembling hand and pulled something out of her arms. Her little hand held a lemon candy.</p>
<p>Stories were flowing in the small candy.</p>
<p>A very old story. Old and missed sentences loved by only one reader.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung stared at the candy for a long time, then she fell down, as if her energy had run out.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sooyoung like that, RepresentativeKimDokja laughed.</p>
<p>[Great last sentence, Han Sooyoung.]</p>
<p>A black claw protruded from the darkness towards the neck of the unconscious Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p>[What happens to a writer who has no more stories to write, after all.]</p>
<p>It was then that a star twinkled across the sky.</p>
<p>As the dazzling sunlight illuminated the alleyway, 'RepresentativeKimDokja' looked up with a frown.</p>
<p>[Have you come to disturb me again?]</p>
<p>[Constellation, 'Lotus blossoming under the moonlight' is glaring at RepresentativeKimDokja.]</p>
<p>[If you want to intervene, come. But it will be different from last time.]</p>
<p>Despite the terrifying starlight swirling in the sky, 'RepresentativeKimDokja' was not shaken.</p>
<p>[Do you think you, who do not even have a proper incarnation, dare to manifest directly here?]</p>
<p>In the next moment, the entire alley was bathed in bright light.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Lotus that blooms under the moonlight' blooms white.]</p>
<p>Surprised, RepresentativeKimDokja looked around.</p>
<p>Hopefully it can't be.</p>
<p>No matter how much it is, 'Lotus that blooms under the Moonlight' can’t dare to go against the law of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; and manifest in the beginning scenarios—</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Lotus that blooms under the moonlight' smiles.]</p>
<p>An arrow flew out of nowhere and grazed his cheek.</p>
<p>The 7th grade devils who were guarding him screamed and crouched down.</p>
<p>"Shoot!"</p>
<p>A cry from the other side of the alley. Incarnations dressed as government soldiers were shooting arrows toward the alley.</p>
<p>"Kill the demons!"</p>
<p>When RepresentativeKimDokja, frowning, waved his hand, the rain of arrows that flew in disappeared in an instant.</p>
<p>[Foolish-]</p>
<p>Then, the new model of Han Sooyoung, who was in the middle of the alley a while ago, was not visible.</p>
<p>The sound of wires came from somewhere. An incarnation, carrying the fallen Han Sooyoung, was already running away.</p>
<p>"Shoot! Keep shooting!"</p>
<p>Hearing the wrath of the gods, RepresentativeKimDokja held back his accusations.</p>
<p>[Oh, really.]</p>
<p>It wasn't difficult to hit the flying arrows. However, he was also in a position where he could not attack the incarnations.</p>
<p>It is because the size of the 'Great Hall' was gradually shrinking, and the foreboding of a probability storm has been lingering in his entire body.</p>
<p>It was natural.</p>
<p>He is the deity of the lofty otherworld.</p>
<p>Attacking 'Han Sooyoung', an irregular from another world line, and dealing with the incarnations of the beginning scenarios are not likely to be equal.</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja said after staring at the twinkling stars in the sky for a while.</p>
<p>[Kim Dokja’s Company. A story where no one dies, how long do you think this will be possible?]</p>
<p>With one last question, his new model disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>"The guy ran away!"</p>
<p>Eventually, the rain of arrows from the incarnations stopped.</p>
<p>"It's an item! It's the skin of a demon!"</p>
<p>The incarnations who discovered the body of the dead demon species cheered.</p>
<p>Moments later, the incarnation, who was running with Han Sooyoung on their back, stopped walking on the roof.</p>
<p>"You’re safe now."</p>
<p>A soft, gentle voice. Han Sooyoung, who came to her senses, lifted her eyelids in confidence. She could see the scenery around her through her gloomy vision.</p>
<p>In the landscape of the night where the moonlight descended on her, she saw the embodiment of the small body holding her.</p>
<p>"Yoo Sangah?"</p>
<p>No. Although the atmosphere was touching, it was definitely different from Yoo Sangah.</p>
<p>But at first glance, a familiar face was shown. More than anything else, she couldn't tell who it was if she looked like that.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Lotus that blooms under the moonlight' tells the incarnation 'Han Sooyoung' that it's okay to rest.]</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung glanced blankly at the sky and slowly closed her eyes. The stars in the sky twinkled once again.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Lotus that blooms under the moonlight' expresses gratitude for your help.]</p>
<p>Then, the incarnation carrying Han Sooyoung said.</p>
<p>"We have to help each other and live. By the way... It's amazing. I didn't know this person really existed."</p>
<p>[A constellation 'a lotus blossoming under her moonlight' asks if you know her.]</p>
<p>"Should I say that I know… I think it’s a bit complicated."</p>
<p>[Constellation 'lotus flower blooming under the moonlight' asks if you can take care of her.]</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Lotus flower that blooms under the moonlight' looks at Han Sooyoung with pity.]</p>
<p>The incarnation also nodded her head as if agreeing with her.</p>
<p>"Anyway, writers are all the same."</p>
<p>She poked at the sleeping Han Sooyoung's cheek as if it were strange, and said.</p>
<p>"The manuscript she was asked to write is unwritten and wasteful of energy, and her health care is a mess..."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Lotus that blooms under the moonlight' asks how you know it so well.]</p>
<p>The incarnation, who looked down at Han Sooyoung's face, smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>"My writer did the same."</p>
