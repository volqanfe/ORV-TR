<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">673 Episode 21 Kim Dokja (9)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>I stared blankly at the audience, like an actor who forgot his lines.</p>
<p>What did I just hear?</p>
<p>【I can't tell you how fortunate I am that you came to this world line. Don’t we all think so?】</p>
<p>The kkomas Kim Dokja didn't answer anything. Just looking at me without saying anything positive or negative.</p>
<p>Representative Kim Dokja laughed as if he was happy about that.</p>
<p>【Could it be that he still doesn’t know who he is?】</p>
<p>At Representative Kim Dokja's words, languid sighs came from all over the audience.</p>
<p>[The story 'Recorder of Things that will Disappear' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>I looked back at the screen. The stories of the lives of myself and the readers were displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>But that wasn't the whole story.</p>
<p>Like the shadows reflected on the cave walls, some scenes were abnormally exaggerated and others were cut out.</p>
<p>The story on the screen was more exciting than the reality I felt, and the target of my anger was clear.</p>
<p>A narrative of good and punishment with clear good and bad roles.</p>
<p>"Has our story been shown this way all this time?"</p>
<p>The image on the screen stopped along with my question. While the kkomas Kim Dokja were talking loudly, Representative Kim Dokja took a step forward.</p>
<p>When I think about it, I still don't know Representative Kim Dokja's purpose. I didn't really know why he brought the readers here or why he was confronting &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;.</p>
<p>【You're right. Because I have to write a 'new story'.】</p>
<p>New story.</p>
<p>Representative Kim Dokja was looking at Yoo Joonghyuk who had fallen on the floor.</p>
<p>【And a 'new story' needs a 'new protagonist'.】</p>
<p>With a beeping sound, the image on the screen changed.</p>
<p>【I remember the first time I saw you.】</p>
<p>What was shown on the screen was the scenery of Geumho Station.</p>
<p>The first scenario, which I also know well - the scene of 'proving our worth'.</p>
<p>「Kim Cheolyang’s head exploded with the sound of bub bub buk.」</p>
<p>The people of Geumho Station, Kim Cheolyang and the Life Church were dying after being deceived.</p>
<p>The screen showed a close-up of my facial expression as I smiled in inexplicable joy at the exact moment they died.</p>
<p>For a moment, I had nothing to say.</p>
<p>Clearly the story on this screen has been edited. Nevertheless, that expression was clearly mine.</p>
<p>【Your arrival wasn't something I had planned, but now I think it worked out well.】</p>
<p>The screen kept changing.</p>
<p>A scene which development changed when we met Bang Cheolsoo's gang at Geumho Station.</p>
<p>「"Prove it once."」</p>
<p>The scene where I met Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st round and fell into the Han River.</p>
<p>「"It’s definitely Cheon Inho. Then it won’t matter if this woman dies."」</p>
<p>The scene of escaping with Jung Heewon, who has awakened as judge.</p>
<p>[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon'’s characteristics blossom into the character Destroying Judge (Hero).]</p>
<p>The scene where I met the Killer King siblings, defeated the 'Dark Sentinel', and gained 'thoughts of almost everything'.</p>
<p>「"Cheon Inho!"」</p>
<p>When I met Anna Croft in 'Welcome Prison' and confirmed the past of Cheon Inho from the 40th round.</p>
<p>「"The moment you press the reset button, this world does not disappear, but becomes eternal."」</p>
<p>The scene where I met the Seven Apostle Ye Hyunwoo and Gong Pildu in Chungmuro.</p>
<p>「"Cheon In-ho looks like this... He's much more handsome than what I read."」</p>
<p>In the 'Emergency Defense Battle', saving Max by pushing him to the ground.</p>
<p>「"If the monsters hadn’t died here, would this story have been really interesting."」</p>
<p>While clearing the scenario of the theater dungeon, the reader Jung Jaewoo was lost.</p>
<p>「"I don't want to die."」</p>
<p>Until I finally got to the rooftop of the theater and came face to face with Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p>「"Really, is it Han Sooyoung?"」</p>
<p>For a moment, I even forgot about my situation and was absorbed in the memory. It occurred to me that a lot had happened in a short period of time.</p>
<p>There were memories missing between scenes. Memories that are not written down anywhere but remain intact in my head.</p>
<p>The video stopped again and Representative Kim Dokja opened his mouth.</p>
<p>【Because you are the one best suited to end their story.】</p>
<p>I couldn’t figure out who 'they' was referring to.</p>
<p>Did it refer to the characters who died in this rounds, or —when I turned my head, the kkomas Kim Dokja were looking at the screen with their mouths open.</p>
<p>What is written is not everything.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean that what they saw was a lie.</p>
<p>The kkomas Kim Dokja had a somewhat nostalgic look in their eyes.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and opened my mouth.</p>
<p>"I’m the main character."</p>
<p>It was a funny story.</p>
<p>If they make a movie with me as the main character, it will 100% fail.</p>
<p>"If you were secretly filming a movie like that, shouldn’t you have gotten my permission first?"</p>
<p>Representative Kim Dokja’s eyes widened at my obvious voice.</p>
<p>"If you’re going to do something like that, first pay the price."</p>
<p>I don't know what they plan to do with me as the main character, but from my point of view, it was best to take advantage of this situation as much as possible. My goal now is to destroy the 'absolute throne.' If I can-</p>
<p>【Haha-】</p>
<p>"…?"</p>
<p>【Ahaha. Ahahahahah!】</p>
<p>A sound of laughter that seems to be driven by mania. Representative Kim Dokja was not the only one laughing.</p>
<p>A few kkomas Kim Dokja were also smiling as if they were having fun.</p>
<p>【Sorry. It's such a hateful and nostalgic reaction.】</p>
<p>"What?</p>
<p>【Great. I’ll pay the price. Is this enough?】</p>
<p>[You have won 300,000 coins!]</p>
<p>Coins suddenly poured out of thin air. I looked up into space blankly as golden waves scattered out of nowhere. I had a feeling that something was going wrong.</p>
<p>【By the way. I need to make sure I hired the right actor.】</p>
<p>After a moment of hesitation, his cool tone penetrated my heart.</p>
<p>【Kim Dokja.】</p>
<p>Just a three letter name.</p>
<p>Why does that name that I have called, read, and used countless times sound so painful?</p>
<p>[The attribute 'He who peered into the abyss' is activated.]</p>
<p>I felt dizzy for a moment.</p>
<p>It felt like my body was being sucked down, as if someone had grabbed my ankle and pulled me down.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a memory came to mind when people incited me to be 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p>I had a similar experience back then as I do now.</p>
<p>My soul was sucked into the depths of the ocean, like an abyss, and there I heard the stories of readers.</p>
<p>But what I heard there weren’t just readers’ stories.</p>
<p>The image on the screen changed.</p>
<p>「"The person who will read my novel... is not you."」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja spoke in his memory, along with the painful voice of a familiar person and blood drops bouncing on the screen.</p>
<p>「"Han Sooyoung. I'm sorry, but I really don't remember. These days, I also haven't read Ways of Survival."」</p>
<p>'Maybe I really thought, 'maybe it’s not Kim Dokja'.'</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; said.</p>
<p>「"Dokja, can you stand up for a moment? If you keep lying down, your back will be ruined."」</p>
<p>「"How about doing gymnastics with me?"」</p>
<p>「"Is it okay, Ahjussi? I'll at least bring a pack of stories."」</p>
<p>Memories with them.</p>
<p>「"Wow, that's the method you used?"」</p>
<p>「"This recipe was taught to me by a man."」</p>
<p>「"Did you always do all this alone?"」</p>
<p>At the end of the scenario, Kim Dokja was speaking.</p>
<p>「"The other me might not want this. The story... that's where it ended..."」</p>
<p>I was thinking again.</p>
<p>「If I could be reborn, I hope I won’t be Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>A distant meteor flew with a halo of light. The world became wider and narrower in an instant.</p>
<p>A pale, blue planet.</p>
<p>A meteor fell.</p>
<p>「"I also want to have my own story."」</p>
<p>A child born where the meteor fell burst into tears.</p>
<p>I watched myself crying in my parents' arms for a long time.</p>
<p>【Are you still going to deny who you are?】</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>【Aren’t you angry? Why did you have to suffer so much?】</p>
<p>【Why did you have to be denounced as a 'fake' and have your position taken away?】</p>
<p>His voice was like a narration heard among distant stars.</p>
<p>【Don’t you think we should take revenge on them?】</p>
<p>Memories that come to mind even if I try to deny them.</p>
<p>As several kkomas Kim Dokja shook their heads, sparks flew in the air.</p>
<p>Representative Kim Dokja spoke.</p>
<p>【Now it’s your turn.】</p>
<p>His eyes were burning, as if he had been waiting for this moment.</p>
<p>【Prove that you were real. Defeat Kim Dokja’s Company and free this world line from their long and boring story. It's about creating the extra paradise you've dreamed of.】</p>
<p>Just then, Yoo Joonghyuk, who had fallen to the floor, wriggled slightly. It seemed like he was slowly regaining consciousness.</p>
<p>【Please stop Yoo Joonghyuk. I will lend you the probability that you are lacking.】</p>
<p>I came here to stop Yoo Joonghyuk. To prevent him from attaining the 'absolute throne' and thus prevent this world's destruction.</p>
<p>【This is your last chance to change the foundation of the universe that oppresses you.】</p>
<p>The foundation of the universe.</p>
<p>The moment I heard those words, I slowly came to my senses. Han Sooyoung’s words came to mind.</p>
<p>「"I have come to the 'conclusion' of all these stories. To stop this damn tragedy that won’t end!"」</p>
<p>At that time, I was angry after hearing Han Sooyoung’s words.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask her why she was stopping me, since they were the ones who twisted the world line of the 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p>The people of this world line also deserve to be happy.</p>
<p>Extras in this world also deserve to live their own lives.</p>
<p>Even if the end of this world is predetermined, I wanted to say that it is not a world that she can destroy without care. However,</p>
<p>「Why did Han Sooyoung try to destroy this world?」</p>
<p>The events of this world line occurred but were not recorded.</p>
<p>Everything that happened in this world serves to fill the empty link between 'Ways of Survival' and 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'.</p>
<p>But what would happen if the ending of this world line changed?</p>
<p>【Now, we are destroying the universe of Kim Dokja’s Company.】</p>
<p>I looked down at the theater floor. The floor is tangled with countless footprints of kkomas Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>【The basis of the &lt;Star Stream&gt;, which ruled your fate. It will destroy the ending of the world that only Kim Dokja knew.】</p>
<p>In a corner of my heart, this feeling grew stronger.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm wrong.</p>
<p>Even if the ending of this world changes, the world of &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; may be safe.</p>
<p>Just a branch of a new parallel universe will be born.</p>
<p>It may end with this.</p>
<p>But if that's not the case.</p>
<p>If in return for changing the ending, all the world lines of 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』 are destroyed.</p>
<p>「What if that was the reason Han Sooyoung tried to stop me?」</p>
<p>When I suddenly raised my head, Representative Kim Dokja was approaching in front of me.</p>
<p>Above his outstretched hand was a sword emitting a dazzling fan.</p>
<p>【Please take it.】</p>
<p>A sword that will change the ending of this world.</p>
<p>It was not the non-awakened 'Death Sword' that I had, but a holy relic Death Sword that had fully awakened.</p>
<p>An item with a medium-sized story shining above the engraved constellations, which can take down the 'absolute throne' right away.</p>
<p>【It's time to end their story with your own hands.】</p>
