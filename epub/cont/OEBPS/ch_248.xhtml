<hr/>
<p>A splendid army of seraphs illuminated the darkness. The seraphs of &lt;Eden&gt;, each of which was as strong as a Historical-grade Constellation, and the Archangels of &lt;Eden&gt; who commanded them, revealed their outlines in the void.</p>
<p>As expected, most of them were Archangels I knew.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Lily pin of Aquarius' looks at you.]</p>
<p>Archangel Gabriel.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Guardian of Youth and Travel' looks at you.]</p>
<p>Archangel Raphael.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Friend of Justice and Harmony' takes pity on you.]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'He who looks face to face with God' looks at you.]</p>
<p>Archangel Raguel and Camael.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is looking at you.]</p>
<p>Killer King's sponsor, Archangel Jophiel.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Savior of the Fall' is looking at you.]</p>
<p>Even Michael, the strongest Archangel.</p>
<p>I calmed my pounding heart and checked the faces of the Archangels again and again.</p>
<p>Uriel is gone.</p>
<p>A belated worry came over me.</p>
<p>Maybe she had tried too hard to save me last time. Or maybe I had received some kind of threat from &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p>「Come to your senses.」</p>
<p>As if it was not the time to worry about Uriel, the Demon King of Salvation warned through the [Fourth Wall]. I swallowed and nodded.</p>
<p>The fact that I could endure facing such magnificent Archangels was all thanks to the naked (clothed) man blocking my way.</p>
<p>The Monarch Slayer Jaehwan.</p>
<p>I realized once again how great he was. Even if you search through the entire &lt;Star Stream&gt;, it would be difficult to find a Constellation that wouldn’t be intimidated by a single Giant Nebula.</p>
<p>Even that figure calmly reaching for the hilt of his sword as if such a threat was ridiculous…</p>
<p>"Wait a minute!"</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>Jaehwan glared at me with a sharp gaze. I belatedly regretted it.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, why did I do that?</p>
<p>Why did I stop Jaehwan?</p>
<p>"They might not have come to fight."</p>
<p>That’s right. That was my reason.</p>
<p>While I was with the 'Demon King of Salvation', I was chased by Giant Nebulas several times.</p>
<p>&lt;Asgard&gt; and &lt;Olympus&gt;. Or small Nebulas like &lt;Gwiok&gt;.</p>
<p>But I’ve never been chased by &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p>"Let’s talk about it first."</p>
<p>"Why should I?"</p>
<p>By the way, Jaehwan, the 'Monarch Slayer', has another nickname, 'God Slayer'.</p>
<p>"There's no need to hurt someone who doesn't have any hostility."</p>
<p>"That guy Yoo Joonghyuk told me. He said that there are no harmless Constellations in the world."</p>
<p>Joonghyuk, what on earth did he say?</p>
<p>"No, Constellations aren’t generally harmful."</p>
<p>I don't know why I'm defending the Constellations.</p>
<p>But this was the only way to prevent a catastrophe. If there was Uriel among them that I hadn't discovered, it would be a big deal.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and spoke in one breath.</p>
<p>"That's Yoo Joonghyuk's standard, and yours is different. Look at those fluttering pure white wings. Do they look like bad Constellations to you?"</p>
<p>Jaehwan glanced at the Archangels again at my words. Maybe the Monarch Slayer was a pretty sensible person.</p>
<p>At that moment, one of the Archangels who caught my eye stepped forward. He was the Archangel who shouldn't have stepped forward the most.</p>
<p>[You are the 'Monarch Slayer'—]</p>
<p>I stepped in front of Jaehwan before Archangel Stab was activated.</p>
<p>"Over there! Wait a minute! Over there!"</p>
<p>[...?]</p>
<p>"Savior of the Corrupted! Don't finish that sentence now!"</p>
<p>Michael glared at me as I stepped in front of Jaehwan and opened my mouth again.</p>
<p>[What are you?]</p>
<p>Michael, the Savior of the Corrupted, is a Constellation of the Tale of the Fall. He's not even a simple Tale of the Fall, he's an Archangel who can reach the level of a Myth-grade when he activates 'Demon King'. There's probably only one incarnation in the entire &lt;Star Stream&gt; who can tease an Archangel like that.</p>
<p>"Me? I'm Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>Damn it, why am I Kim Dokja?</p>
<p>Michael, who had been glaring at me, asked back in a stupid voice.</p>
<p>[So?]</p>
<p>"Let's all get along well."</p>
<p>An eerie silence swept over the surroundings. I heard Raphael's sighing voice, and I also saw Gabriel shaking his head with his hand on his head. Jophiel stared at me as if he was looking at a strange creature.</p>
<p>And then,</p>
<p>Kugugugugu!</p>
<p>Michael began to unleash his power without hesitation.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Savior of the Fall' reveals his status.]</p>
<p>I hid behind Jaehwan again while watching Michael approaching step by step.</p>
<p>Honestly, why wouldn't I want to see it?</p>
<p>Michael vs. Jaehwan.</p>
<p>Savior of the Corrupted vs. Monarch Slayer.</p>
<p>Especially, if it was Michael and Jaehwan who activated 'Demon King', it would be a spectacle that I wouldn't be able to see even if I paid a thousand gold coins.</p>
<p>However, that's something 'rlaehrwk41' would think about, and it wasn't something I would be thinking about right now.</p>
<p>If a great clash of Myth-grade Constellations occurred right before my eyes, Yoo Joonghyuk and I would be swept away by the fierce waves of the stories and our limbs would be torn apart.</p>
<p>"Hey, Jaehwan-ssi. Actually, this is a bad guy. Could you kill just one of them?"</p>
<p>While Jaehwan was looking back at me as if he was dumbfounded, the other Archangels were approaching Michael.</p>
<p>I shouted in a hurry.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute! Stop! You know how scary this guy is!"</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Archangels had heard rumors of Jaehwan and were not acting rashly.</p>
<p>I quickly added.</p>
<p>"And this guy is not an evil person! He rejects evil and worships good! Isn't that the motto of your &lt;Eden&gt;? Never judge by appearances! He's even dressed so neatly!"</p>
<p>"You bastard."</p>
<p>I ignored Jaehwan's growling words and continued to shout.</p>
<p>"This person saved me and Yoo Joonghyuk. He saved us from the terrible Constellations of &lt;Olympus&gt; and &lt;Asgard&gt;— from the Gods of the Outer World!"</p>
<p>Jaehwan's sword, which was half-drawn, stopped for the first time. It felt like he was trying to hear what I was saying.</p>
<p>"This person also patted my back when I swallowed story fragments. It hurt so much that I could die, but I survived, so I guess I received the grace of life."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Is that all? He stabbed and killed every Outer God who came near him for a whole ten days. Where else would you find someone who would show me such kindness while the Giant Nebulae were after me? Yes?"</p>
<p>When I came to my senses, I found myself repeating the argument of the 'Demon King of Salvation' like a parrot. But as I spoke, it seemed like he was right.</p>
<p>A murderer of Monarchs is not a villain. At least to me and Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>However, Archangel Jophiel seemed to have a slightly different opinion.</p>
<p>[He is evil.]</p>
<p>An ominous light was flowing out of Jophiel’s eyes. His stigma, [Eye of Sin], had been activated.</p>
<p>When Jaehwan glared at him as if asking what was that, the light of [Eye of Sin] went out with a tsk-tsk sound. It seemed that an absolute being from another universe could extinguish a stigma just by glaring at it.</p>
<p>But even in that situation, Jophiel seemed to have witnessed something.</p>
<p>I struck first before he could open his mouth.</p>
<p>"Yes. Of course, it could be different depending on the perspective—"</p>
<p>[He slaughtered over a million gods.]</p>
<p>I looked back at Jaehwan.</p>
<p>This kid is a villain, right?</p>
<p>But I pretended to be calm and responded.</p>
<p>"Couldn’t all the gods he killed be bad guys? He must have done it with good intentions. Right? He must have tried to make the world a better place—"</p>
<p>"My goal was to destroy the world."</p>
<p>"Yes, so to put it simply, in order to kill the evil gods and purify the world—"</p>
<p>"I killed them because they got in my way."</p>
<p>I wanted to tell him to shut up, but since ancient times, protagonists have never shut up when told to.</p>
<p>In the meantime, another protagonist who had come to his senses spoke to me.</p>
<p>—Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>Little Yoo Joonghyuk was getting up from the floating stone. He seemed to have figured out the general situation.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth to the Archangels, receiving my gaze that told him to stop them somehow.</p>
<p>"I want to kill them all."</p>
<p>Jaehwan nodded and muttered at Yoo Joonghyuk's words.</p>
<p>"There are times when we can see eye to eye."</p>
<p>The situation was becoming increasingly chaotic.</p>
<p>The moment I thought that this wouldn't be easy to solve even if the Demon King of Salvation came in person, Jaehwan's expression changed for the first time.</p>
<p>"This is fun."</p>
<p>The word 'fun' sounded different after meeting him.</p>
<p>I followed Jaehwan's gaze, hiding my ominous feelings. Then, the line of seraphs split, and an Archangel was seen walking from the back.</p>
<p>The Mythical Constellation of &lt;Eden&gt; was there.</p>
<p>The Ruler of the Archangels, and the second-in-command of &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Heavenly Scribe' is looking at you.]</p>
<p>Heavenly Scribe, Metatron.</p>
<p>Who would have thought I would see him here?</p>
<p>I bit my lips without realizing it. The fact that he was here  in person meant that &lt;Eden&gt; was serious about this situation.</p>
<p>[It's nice to meet you.]</p>
<p>A uniquely polite and calm voice.</p>
<p>The first place his eyes turned to was little Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>[The Puppet of the Oldest Dream.]</p>
<p>Then he looked at Jaehwan.</p>
<p>[The Monarch Slayer.]</p>
<p>Finally, he stared at me.</p>
<p>[And...]</p>
<p>He looked at me for a long time, then continued speaking with a faint sense of pride.</p>
<p>[Little lamb. You're afraid.]</p>
<p>Of course. My sponsor would be scared if legions of Archangels came rushing in. What's more, if the opponent was 'Metatron', the master of strategy that even Kim Dokja would shiver with…</p>
<p>[Don't worry. &lt;Eden&gt; and I will not harm you. We have no intention of changing the contents of the 'Revelation'.]</p>
<p>I immediately revised my evaluation of Metatron in my head.</p>
<p>What kind of place is &lt;Eden&gt;? It is a Nebula of angels. Angels are generally kind. If he is the representative of such angels, then he must be the kindest angel of all.</p>
<p>I briefly hoped that he might mediate all of this.</p>
<p>[However, I cannot tolerate beings who break the balance of this world line.]</p>
<p>It was a vain hope.</p>
<p>The moment Metatron and Jaehwan's gazes crossed, Jaehwan pulled out his sword with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>"Your tongue is long. If you are going to attack, attack quickly."</p>
<p>The Archangels who were guarding Metatron quietly raised their voices at his arrogant tone.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Jaehwan continued to speak as if provoking them.</p>
<p>“Do you think you can stop me with just a single person?”</p>
<p>The strength to fight a Giant Nebula alone.</p>
<p>Metatron acknowledged Jaehwan like that.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>[Absolute being of another world line. I know you are strong. If we were to eliminate you, we would not be safe either.]</p>
<p>"You will all die here."</p>
<p>Metatron shrugged lightly and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>[I guess you forgot that this is not your 'worldview'.]</p>
<p>That was when I felt an unusual magical power behind us. A being with the exact opposite attribute of the Archangels.</p>
<p>There were beings that should not be there.</p>
<p>[The Demon King 'Lord of Hell' descends into the void!]</p>
<p>[The Demon King 'Sonic Demon King' descends into the void!]</p>
<p>[The Demon King 'Temptation and Barren Demon King' descends into the void!]</p>
<p>[The Demon King 'Merciless Hunter of the Reverse Heaven' descends into the void!]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[The Demon King 'Ruler of Eastern Hell' descends into the void!]</p>
<p>Demon Kings. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>Why on earth did they show up here?</p>
<p>They wouldn't be trying to start a holy war here.</p>
<p>Hold on. Holy war?</p>
<p>"Run away. Right now."</p>
<p>Jaehwan glared at me as if I was talking nonsense.</p>
<p>"Are you talking about me just now?"</p>
<p>"That's right! Run away with me and Yoo Joonghyuk! Right now!"</p>
<p>I don't think Jaehwan will lose. Even if it's a Myth-grade Constellation, even if it's the famous &lt;Eden&gt;, it wouldn't be easy to deal with Jaehwan.</p>
<p>「But if it's 'sealing' him, it might be a different story.」</p>
<p>Two pitch-black swirling spheres were placed in Metatron's hands. I already knew what those spheres were.</p>
<p>[Get out of this story. Ghost of a ruined universe.]</p>
<p>That was a forbidden technique that Han Sooyoung once used to seal 'Yoo Joonghyuk of the 1,863rd Round.'</p>
<p>[Mythical tale 'Seal of the Apocalypse' begins its storytelling!]</p>
<p>As long as this is the &lt;Star Stream&gt;, there is no one who can break that seal.</p>
