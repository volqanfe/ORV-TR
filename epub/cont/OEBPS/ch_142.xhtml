<hr/>
<p>How is the &lt;Asgard&gt; in the 41st round related to the 'Demon King of Salvation'?</p>
<p>Do they know?</p>
<p>Did they find out the information through readers?</p>
<p>There was little chance of that happening, as most of what the readers say from 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' has probably been filtered.</p>
<p>Or the giant nebula that killed Kim Dokja some time ago.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that it was &lt;Asgard&gt;.</p>
<p>However, even if Odin, the 'One-Eyed Father', is the strongest in &lt;Asgard&gt;, would it be possible to kill Kim Dokja?</p>
<p>Shit. You must have seen a mythical constellation.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don't understand either hypothesis right now.</p>
<p>In the first place, I was convinced that the 'demon king' they were talking about was Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>I held my breath and focused on the conversation between the two people.</p>
<p>"Christina, so that’s why you were so polite to Cheon Inho-ssi—."</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>Christina, reflected in the rear-view mirror, twitched her lips as if disapproving.</p>
<p>"He smells like a demon king. I didn’t feel it at all at first, but after he fainted and woke up, I definitely sensed it."</p>
<p>"So, does this mean that incarnation Cheon Inho is a member of the Demon King’s family?"</p>
<p>"Probably. Not long ago, when the Demon King’s symbol appeared in Las Vegas, I faced one. The same goosebumps I felt back then were conveyed to me."</p>
<p>By nature, hypnotists and other psychics have a much better sense of energy than other incarnations.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be strange to say that Christina Page, who considered herself to be the best among them, could read the demon king's unique energy.</p>
<p>Anyway, Kim Dokja is also half a demon king.</p>
<p>"If it is a demon king, which of the 72 demon kings would it be?"</p>
<p>"I don’t know that."</p>
<p>"Have you had any other contact from &lt;Asgard&gt;?"</p>
<p>"Not at all. After that question, the messages stopped."</p>
<p>The two people glanced in my direction and from then on continued their conversation without speaking.</p>
<p>[Group chat.]</p>
<p>It looks like there's a story that no one should hear.</p>
<p>In the silence that follows, all that is visible outside is a barren desert landscape. I spent my time thinking about future scenarios in my head or observing my sleeping face while snoring.</p>
<p>As I keep looking at this face, it now seems like my real face.</p>
<p>But does It look like a fraudster like that?</p>
<p>But Yoosoung told me I was handsome...</p>
<p>Would it be a good idea to buy a skill like [Humidity Preservation] like Kim Dokja, or to change the atmosphere a bit by obtaining story fragments such as [Casanova's Face]?</p>
<p>Come to think of it, it seems like Kim Dokja is also secretly very thorough in self-management.</p>
<p>You can tell he was concerned about the turtle neck just by looking at the fact that he put a pillow on his neck for a short period of time.</p>
<p>...Neck pillow?</p>
<p>I felt a strange feeling for a moment, so I looked up the item.</p>
<fieldset>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">&lt;Item information&gt;</h3>
<p>Name: SSS grade neck pillow</p>
<p>Grade: SSS</p>
<p>Description: This is a 'neck pillow' made by the mass-produced manufacturer. It is characterized by a cute dokkaebi face drawing.</p>
<p>Users of this pillow do not have any dreams and can enjoy a recovery effect comparable to consuming the essence of Elaine Forest at bedtime.</p>
<p>When a dangerous situation occurs, the [Alarm] function is activated to force the user to wake up.</p>
<p>*This item belongs to incarnation Cheon Inho.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>It was obvious with whose coin this person bought the pillow.</p>
<p>Even though it was just a pillow, I looked up the price thinking how much it would cost and my eyes almost popped out.</p>
<p>[The price of this item is 10,000 coins.]</p>
<p>After thoroughly checking the refund policy and return procedures for the dokkaebi bag, I decided to charge Kim Dokja the amount.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is activated.]</p>
<p>—Phew, I slept well.</p>
<p>What amazing timing.</p>
<p>I fired off questions in quickly.</p>
<p>'When did you buy this pillow?'</p>
<p>—Just before I went to sleep.</p>
<p>'Try to convince me. Before I get really angry.'</p>
<p>Kim Dokja, who had already finished understanding the situation, rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>He started talking.</p>
<p>—Humans spend one-third of their day sleeping.</p>
<p>'Now we don’t have to sleep that much.'</p>
<p>—This is an item that Yoo Joonghyuk and Yoo Sangah also used.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk used this item?</p>
<p>This item with a cute dokkaebi face drawn on it?</p>
<p>—That kid is so popular that someone must have given it to him as a gift. Anyway, it's a useful item for us. We faint a lot.</p>
<p>'So?'</p>
<p>—Be sure to support your neck before you fall. If you get a concussion, it's a big deal.</p>
<p>'…'</p>
<p>—And read the options carefully. It is said that it has a similar effect to consuming the essence of Elaine Forest when sleeping.</p>
<p>I calculated it in my head.</p>
<p>'Elain Forest's Spirit' costs 500 coins each.</p>
<p>That means.</p>
<p>—Even if you use it just 20 times, you get your money's worth.</p>
<p>'How many times can I use it?'</p>
<p>—Well. If you use it sparingly, wouldn’t it be able to be used for quite a long time? It says here that after-sales service is also provided.</p>
<p>'I admit. I forgive you for your sins.'</p>
<p>This was a very efficient item, right?</p>
<p>I feel good knowing that I once again made a satisfactory purchase.</p>
<p>After sleeping well, Kim Dokja stretched lightly and looked out the window.</p>
<p>I turned around.</p>
<p>Slowly, the city of Las Vegas was appearing.</p>
<p>[The seventh 'main scenario' is currently in progress.]</p>
<p>[The eighth 'main scenario' is currently in progress.]</p>
<p>A series of system messages appeared.</p>
<p>I was puzzled.</p>
<p>The seventh scenario hasn't even been completed, but the eighth  scenario is in progress?</p>
<p>—There was something like this in the 3rd round too.</p>
<p>I remember too. While the fourth scenario was in progress, part of the fifth scenario, the 'Disaster' scenario, was solved.</p>
<p>However, it was a temporary situation at that time, and the two main scenarios did not unfold simultaneously like they do now.</p>
<p>Something seems wrong.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>'The seventh would be a monster invasion scenario, what would the eighth be?'</p>
<p>For reference, Korea's eighth scenario in the third round was 'The Strongest Scapegoat'.</p>
<p>—That was the third round in Korea. I don't know what it's like here.</p>
<p>'That's right.'</p>
<p>The 'Strongest Sacrifice' scenario is an extreme scenario that ends only when half of the incarnations in the area die or when the strongest incarnation dies.</p>
<p>I hope it will be a smooth scenario in the 41st round.</p>
<p>"We’ve arrived. You’re already up."</p>
<p>"Thanks to you, I slept well."</p>
<p>Selena Kim laughed at Kim Dokja's sly answer.</p>
<p>The entrance to the casino hotel, the symbol of Las Vegas, began to be visible in the distance.</p>
<p>I guess it's because it's still daytime. The hotel street, with the lights off, had a somewhat eerie atmosphere for a gambling mecca.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' wipes his head with a curious expression.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' shakes his head saying that these buildings are not clean.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'King Heungmu' boasts that they cannot imitate the architectural style of the Korean Peninsula.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' holds his tongue as he looks at the constellations on the Korean Peninsula.]</p>
<p>Well, the whole world has already become a gambling den for constellations, so how meaningful is it to see a human gambling den?</p>
<p>Christina parked her car in front of the largest hotel on Casino Street.</p>
<p>This is the home of Zarathustra.</p>
<p>When the doorman who came to greet us opened the car door, a crowd of people gathered at the entrance of the casino hotel was noticed. A mixed group of people of various races, each with their own weapons.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja asked with a grin.</p>
<p>"Am I not a welcome guest?"</p>
<p>"It’s not our group."</p>
<p>Selena Kim and Christina stood in front of Kim Dokja as if guarding him.</p>
<p>When I saw  it, I was a bit puzzled because the local situation on the American side was never revealed in the main story.</p>
<p>But Kim Dokja already knew who they were.</p>
<p>—It looks like the Las Vegas civil war is not over yet.</p>
<p>'Do you know who it is?'</p>
<p>—Las Vegas gang.</p>
<p>Is it like the American ironclad faction?</p>
<p>—It's a much more elite organization than those guys.</p>
<p>'But there is an absolute throne in America too, right? The unification of forces would have been achieved.'</p>
<p>—Have you already forgotten what we did?</p>
<p>It occurred to me later that Kim Dokja killed the founder of the absolute throne.</p>
<p>What if America’s 'absolute throne' also lost its effectiveness like the one in Korea did?</p>
<p>Now that the throne's absolute power has disappeared, it is naturally useless.</p>
<p>—Anna must be having a headache too.</p>
<p>Naturally, it is a powerful force that fills the place where the throne has disappeared.</p>
<p>A powerful force that can claim to be the king.</p>
<p>Before we knew it, the leader of the group approached us.</p>
<p>A long fur coat and a T-shirt with a skull on it. A cross necklace shining in silver. A Hispanic man wearing a cowboy hat that looked like something out of a western movie. Even at a glance, he was giving off an unusual vibe.</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>When Kim Dokja asked, Selena Kim answered.</p>
<p>"Jacob Martinez. King of North Las Vegas."</p>
<p>When the man got close enough, Selena Kim took a step forward and said,</p>
<p>"Mr. Martinez."</p>
<p>The man responded, nodding his head towards Selena Kim.</p>
<p>"It’s been a while. Guardian of the King."</p>
<p>"What’s going on here?"</p>
<p>"I came to see the prophet."</p>
<p>It looks like Anna Croft has some business to do over there, just like us. Judging by the ghastly atmosphere, it didn't seem like the visit was for good reasons.</p>
<p>Christina, who was watching the situation, intervened.</p>
<p>"I’m sorry, but Anna has plans today. Why don’t you come next time?"</p>
<p>"Get out of the way."</p>
<p>"If it’s urgent, tell me what you want. I’ll tell her."</p>
<p>Martinez glared at Christina with a cold gaze.</p>
<p>"We have come to demand compensation."</p>
<p>"Compensation? What compensation?"</p>
<p>"Our group suffered too much damage during the subjugation of the 4 grade monster species. We demand compensation for that."</p>
<p>4th grade 4. It seems that a similar level of monster species has appeared in the United States as well.</p>
<p>"The damage was all the same."</p>
<p>"We lost our entire home. It’s because your masterful touts guided the direction of the 'disaster' to the northern part of Las Vegas."</p>
<p>"It’s not Anna’s fault. Even Anna can’t do anything about a natural disaster."</p>
<p>"Are you saying the prophet couldn’t read the future?"</p>
<p>"Hey."</p>
<p>"She must have seen the northern part of Las Vegas flying away with her vision of the future. Yet the prophet did not give us any indication."</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>"If the response had been a little late, all the women and children would have been swept away to death."</p>
<p>Before I knew it, Kim Dokja and I were listening attentively to the two people's argument.</p>
<p>Anna must have had her own reasons for not telling them everything about the future.</p>
<p>But if someone else dies in return, whose responsibility is it?</p>
<p>How much responsibility does a prophet who knows the future bear for not telling the future she knows?</p>
<p>Christina answered with a frown.</p>
<p>"I'll discuss compensation and coin support. So, leave at this point. Unless you want to make a big deal out of it."</p>
<p>"I guess I need to meet the Prophet."</p>
<p>With a clanking sound, Martinez pulled out his pistol from its holster. At the same time, the group guarding him also pointed their weapons in this direction.</p>
<p>If this continues, a large-scale armed conflict is expected.</p>
<p>But Christina didn't look nervous. There was already a pocket watch in her right hand.</p>
<p>Martinez said.</p>
<p>"I already know about your hypnotism skills."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Would it be faster for your watch to tick? Or would it be faster for my bullet to blow a hole in your head?"</p>
<p>"You can try it now—"</p>
<p>Everything happened in an instant.</p>
<p>Was it first that I heard the sound of a fur coat flapping, or that the person who had been the doorman a moment ago transformed into Martinez?</p>
<p>Front and left. The two Martinezes opened their mouths at the same time.</p>
<p>"You seem to have forgotten who I am, hypnotist."</p>
<p>Before we knew it, Martinez's pistol was touching Christina's left eyebrow. Biting her lip, Christina slowly dropped her watch, holding both of her hands above her head.</p>
<p>I asked, somewhat impressed by Martinez's skills.</p>
<p>'How did he do it? Avatar?'</p>
<p>[Avatar is the author’s unique skill.]</p>
<p>So, is Martinez also a 'writer'?</p>
<p>—That guy is a 'magician'.</p>
<p>Magician?</p>
<p>"Hypnotist, I am going to kill you from now on."</p>
<p>"Martinez, wait a minute."</p>
<p>"If anyone moves, I will shoot immediately."</p>
<p>Martinez, who glared at Selena Kim, added as if warning.</p>
<p>"I’ll count to three. If your leader is really a 'prophet', she will come out on her own. She would have read the future where her subordinates will die."</p>
<p>Martinez immediately started counting to three. A cold count without any hesitation.</p>
<p>However, even when the count reached 1, Anna Croft did not appear.</p>
<p>"It seems the prophet’s name was fake. Otherwise—"</p>
<p>The trigger was pulled.</p>
<p>"She didn’t value you at all."</p>
<p>And there was someone who moved a little faster than the trigger.</p>
<p>"Anna won’t come out."</p>
<p>As expected, everything happened in a split second.</p>
<p>No, it was probably a long and leisurely time, even though it only lasted a moment.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja slowly raised his arm and gently wrapped the end of the pistol as if holding a teacup.</p>
<p>"She can’t see the future right now."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, no one except me could witness his actions.</p>
<p>Christina, Selena Kim, and Martinez all looked shocked.</p>
<p>A face of disbelief as to how on earth this was possible.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Humanity’s First Magician' is astonished.]</p>
<p>Only I knew the method used by Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>It was neither skills nor magic.</p>
<p>[The story 'The Stone and I' ends.]</p>
<p>Martinez came to his senses late and urgently pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>Click. Click.</p>
<p>But the pistol did not fire.</p>
<p>[The story of 'The Pistol and I' continues.]</p>
<p>Kim Dokja snatched the pistol at once and pulled the trigger into the air as if he was joking.</p>
<p>"Because I came."</p>
<p>With a bang, a congratulatory shot rang out announcing our debut in Las Vegas.</p>
