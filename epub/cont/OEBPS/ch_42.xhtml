<hr/>
<p>【Hm? You.】</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja grabbed the back of my head and looked into my face for a long time.</p>
<p>There was a strange tension in the air.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, this wasn't my first encounter with 'RepresentativeKimDokja'. I had met him once before at the Chungmuro Theater.</p>
<p>Back then, he had seen my face and even checked my name tag.</p>
<p>Was that all?</p>
<p>He gave me privileges to help me adjust to this world, and he read the entire Omniscient Reader I had written and left comments and impressions.</p>
<p>I wondered.</p>
<p>Would 'RepresentativeKimDokja' recognize me?</p>
<p>【Hmm.】</p>
<p>Or he wouldn't recognize me as I expected.</p>
<p>【That's weird. How come you haven't gone back yet?】</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja walked out of the theater, holding the back of my head like a cat clinging to a fish from a fish tank.</p>
<p>So did Yoo Joonghyuk, and I don't know why the hell everyone who sees me wants to carry me around.</p>
<p>By the way, he didn't recognize me after all.</p>
<p>I hesitated for a moment, then decided to implement the plan I'd been thinking about.</p>
<p>'Idea.'</p>
<p>As I said the name in my head, the bracelet on my wrist twitched.</p>
<p>I don't know exactly why, but unlike my other items, the 'Thoughts of Almost Everything' had been summoned here with me.</p>
<p>Either way, it was a good thing for me right now.</p>
<p>"Wait, I don't like hanging like this."</p>
<p>I grabbed RepresentativeKimDokja's wrist, who gripped the back of my head while thinking. I could feel the surface of the bracelet resonating against his hand.</p>
<p>['Idea' is making contact with an unknown item.]</p>
<p>Look at this.</p>
<p>I'm clearly touching his skin, but you call it an 'item'?</p>
<p>[Beginning target analysis.]</p>
<p>[Target analysis will take 5 minutes to complete.]</p>
<p>[Maintain contact until the end of the analysis.]</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja was deep in thought and didn't notice the 'Idea'.</p>
<p>I spoke up again in a frustrated tone.</p>
<p>"I didn't go in there because I wanted to, I was just trying to find a way out of here."</p>
<p>【What did you see in there?】</p>
<p>"Little kids......."</p>
<p>[Someone has used 'Lie Detection'.]</p>
<p>'RepresentativeKimDokja' must be an 'outer god', and if you're an outer god, you're bound to have [Lie Detection].</p>
<p>That's a good thing for me.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.4' is activated!]</p>
<p>"I saw some little kids watching a movie inside the theater. But it was dark, so I couldn't see much."</p>
<p>[You have incited yourself.]</p>
<p>I immediately opened my mouth.</p>
<p>"What movie were the little kids watching?"</p>
<p>【What kind of movie was it?】</p>
<p>"I couldn't look closely because it was dark."</p>
<p>[Someone has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p>
<p>【Hmm.......】</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja glared at me with suspicion, then slowly loosened his grip on the back of my head.</p>
<p>But I did not let go of his wrist.</p>
<p>[Continuing the analysis of the target.]</p>
<p>"Wait, what are those kids, and why are there so many of them here?"</p>
<p>【Do you want to know?】</p>
<p>I couldn't see RepresentativeKimDokja's eyes because he was wearing sunglasses. However, I could clearly feel the life that radiated from them.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm not too curious."</p>
<p>【Good, because a story where you know the ending is boring.】</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>【Now, if you'll let go of my wrist, I need to find out why you didn't make it back.】</p>
<p>That's a problem.</p>
<p>I'm not done analyzing you yet.</p>
<p>"I still have one more question."</p>
<p>【Is that a question you can only ask while grabbing my wrist?】</p>
<p>Behind his sunglasses, I could see the murderous intent once again.</p>
<p>But this time, I didn't back down.</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>【Hmm? Like I said, I—】</p>
<p>"You're not the 'RepresentativeKimDokja' I know, because I've met him before I came here."</p>
<p>In reality, I had only met him once, but I had known him for a very long time.</p>
<p>He messaged me every day for the duration of the series.</p>
<p>I found 'RepresentativeKimDokja' to be a very serious and story-loving person.</p>
<p>But what about the 'RepresentativeKimDokja' in front of me now?</p>
<p>【That's a great insight. Even though our appearances should be exactly the same.......】</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, RepresentativeKimDokja readily admitted the truth.</p>
<p>【You're right. The 'RepresentativeKimDokja' who brought you here is a different being. Is that enough to answer your question?】</p>
<p>There were two RepresentativeKimDokjas.</p>
<p>Maybe more than two.</p>
<p>Is it a group?</p>
<p>If so, what does this group exist for?</p>
<p>[The analysis is more than 80% complete.]</p>
<p>【It's my turn to ask. You—】</p>
<p>"Why 'Kim Dokja'?"</p>
<p>【What?】</p>
<p>"If you needed to disguise yourself, you could have been Yoo Joonghyuk or someone else."</p>
<p>【No, this is just—】</p>
<p>"I thought you hated Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p>At my question, for the first time, RepresentativeKimDokja's complexion changed.</p>
<p>【Why do you think that?】</p>
<p>"Was it actually because you were envious of him? Is that why you took on Kim Dokja's appearance and you're imitating him?"</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja's face slowly hardened. It was as if a vague clue had been unraveled.</p>
<p>[The exclusive attribute is activated!]</p>
<p>For a brief moment, the clues left by RepresentativeKimDokja at the previous Banquet branched out in my mind</p>
<p>「Kim Dokja, Kim Dokja, Kim Dokja, you're really loud. Why the hell do you like him so much?」</p>
<p>He harbored a grudge against Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>「What kind of life will those who are not chosen by Kim Dokja live?」</p>
<p>He sympathized with those who were not saved by Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>「Are you really planning to rely on &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt; here as well?」</p>
<p>He wanted to complete the end of the world without &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt;.</p>
<p>So my reasoning went like this.</p>
<p>"Did Kim Dokja...... ruin your story?"</p>
<p>He is a 'character' who could not fulfill the story he wanted because of Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>That's why the readers of 'Omniscient Reader' have been kidnapped into this world.</p>
<p>「To create the story he wants.」</p>
<p>Who could he be.</p>
<p>I had a few characters in my head, but no names I was sure of.</p>
<p>【You...... Who are you?】</p>
<p>A sudden momentum began to emanate from RepresentativeKimDokja's entire body.</p>
<p>For a moment, I felt sick.</p>
<p>I was digging too deep.</p>
<p>Tsuchuchuchuchuchut—</p>
<p>Intense sparks began to fly around me.</p>
<p>In my head, I weighed the magnitude of the sparks against my life.</p>
<p>How much probability would it take for him to kill me?</p>
<p>And how much more probability was he willing to sacrifice?</p>
<p>[The item analysis has been completed!]</p>
<p>[The item is 'Ever-changing (千變萬化)¹ Stealth Suit.]</p>
<a href="#note1" epub:type="noteref">[NOTE 1]</a><p>[The item is S-grade.]</p>
<p>[You must be hit at least 10 times by the user of the item to obtain the item's form.]</p>
<p>Just in time, the analysis of the 'Idea' has ended.</p>
<p>「Ever-changing Stealth Suit.」</p>
<p>An item of clothing that consumes a certain amount of magic to turn the user's appearance into the desired one.</p>
<p>In other words, he's using the item's power to hide his true self.</p>
<p>'Idea.'</p>
<p>I immediately changed the form of the bracelet.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.4' is activated!]</p>
<p>'Turn into the Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick.'</p>
<p>I wielded the 'Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick' with all my might at RepresentativeKimDokja in front of me.</p>
<p>The tip of his lip twisted, RepresentativeKimDokja lightly stretched out his arm and grabbed the bamboo stick.</p>
<p>Of course, I didn't expect the attack to work. But it wasn't the strike I was aiming for in the first place.</p>
<p>Soon, a bright light emanated from the end of the bamboo stick.</p>
<p>['Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick''s hidden property is activated!]</p>
<p>As a damaged star relic, it was unable to produce its original power, but it had no problem triggering the hidden property.</p>
<p>[The stigma 'Skeleton in the Closet' has been triggered!]</p>
<p>If he's wearing the 'Ever-changing Stealth Suit', he'll have no choice but to reveal his true self in front of this stigma.</p>
<p>Patsuchuchut.</p>
<p>['Skeleton in the Closet' is affected by your status.]</p>
<p>[Your status does not allow you to determine the target's identity.]</p>
<p>Damn it, that was too much for my level.</p>
<p>But for the briefest of moments, I saw part of his cheek crack.</p>
<p>Beyond the crack, an unspoken tension pulsed. A flow of stories so dangerous as to be mindnumbing. An ominous sensation lurking beyond.</p>
<p>Demon Force?</p>
<p>The moment I thought that, his fist stuck in my stomach.</p>
<p>【You must think I can't kill you.】</p>
<p>The feeling of my stomach being ripped open and pierced.</p>
<p>Even though I was a soul, my breath caught in my throat.</p>
<p>【In fact, you're right. I can't kill you directly. There are restrictions on that.】</p>
<p>My left and right arms snapped in different directions, and a painful sensation came over me as if my legs had been amputated.</p>
<p>As soon as I inhaled, something hit my stomach again.</p>
<p>For a moment, my consciousness slipped away and came back.</p>
<p>【But I can give you a pain worse than death.】</p>
<p>He held both my arms together and pushed me back against the wall, then put his magically formed thorns into my wrists and ankles one after another.</p>
<p>Pow. Pow. Pow. Pow. Pow.</p>
<p>In an instant, five or six thorns pierced my limbs.</p>
<p>I activated my skill just before the pain began to spread.</p>
<p>[The level of the exclusive skill 'Incite' has increased!]</p>
<p>「I am Kim Dokja who has the [Fourth Wall].」</p>
<p>【Certainly...... You're not like other readers. I can't believe you can endure this pain.】</p>
<p>He lightly lifted my chin with his long fingers, and then said with interest.</p>
<p>【Come to think of it, I did hear about a special guy from another Representative.......】</p>
<p>"If I'm a special guest, you should treat me specially."</p>
<p>I provoked him.</p>
<p>I had to provoke him further, push him over the edge.</p>
<p>"If you're only this good, you'd already lost to Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>The spark that had been running through his body earlier was getting stronger and stronger. Any moment now, he wouldn't be able to withstand the aftermath of probability.</p>
<p>【I'm getting more and more curious about who you are.】</p>
<p>But RepresentativeKimDokja was smiling subtly at me.</p>
<p>It looked like he was as pleased as angry.</p>
<p>【Suddenly, I feel very nostalgic.】</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja's head turned slowly to an odd angle.</p>
<p>【Right now, you look like someone I hate more than anyone and wanted to eat at the same time.】</p>
<p>Pow.</p>
<p>I felt something dig into my stomach, and the next moment, my stomach was clutched in his grip.</p>
<p>A pain that even the level 5 [Incite] couldn't handle.</p>
<p>Tsuchuchuchuchut.</p>
<p>It was then that something began to ooze from the hole in my stomach.</p>
<p>Sentences, shimmering with golden light.</p>
<p>Stories.</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja's eyes widened.</p>
<p>【This is...... No way? You.......】</p>
<p>The moment he reached out for the story that had fallen to the floor.</p>
<p>「■■■ ■■■ ■■」</p>
<p>The story began its storytelling.</p>
<p>The space around me ripped apart, and my ears rang like a storm was brewing here.</p>
<p>Then I heard a clear voice.</p>
<p>「I told you not to touch it」</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja's expression hardened. His eyes widened and he looked me in the eyes.</p>
<p>Something was speaking through my mouth.</p>
<p>「The y are co ming」</p>
<p>With those words, the ceiling of the movie theater crumbled.</p>
<p>Within my blurry consciousness, I saw RepresentativeKimDokja look up.</p>
<p>Someone shouted, and something flew through the cracked ceiling.</p>
<p>A beautiful thread of light.</p>
<p>It caught me by surprise.</p>
<p>In my slowly fading consciousness, I heard the voice of the angry RepresentativeKimDokja.</p>
<p>It was probably,</p>
<p>「......Kim Dokja's Company!」</p>
<p>He seemed to say something like that.</p>
