<hr/>
<p>“No, wait!”</p>
<p>I wanted to shout that out to &lt;Kim Dokja Copany&gt;, they were surrounding me with ferocious force.</p>
<p>But I can't make a proper sound with this body.</p>
<p>"Would you like to buy a cage first?"</p>
<p>"Do you want to stay in the Dokkaebi’s Bag?"</p>
<p>"Wouldn’t it be okay to ask Biyoo?"</p>
<p>"Should I get a leash too?"</p>
<p>"What kind of dog is this?"</p>
<p>I overheard the conversation of my companions while clinging to Yoo Joonghyuk's grip. Meanwhile, Yoo Joonghyuk was glaring at me with strange eyes.</p>
<p>[A temporary error occurs in this skill.]</p>
<p>[You cannot release level 3 of 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'.]</p>
<p>The skill still did not listen. The moment when the fear rises that if I continue like this, I will really be imprisoned and not be able to go anywhere.</p>
<p>"Okay, everyone, stop joking around."</p>
<p>Yoo Sangah, with a gentle smile, held me up and stopped the crowd.</p>
<p>"Huh? You weren’t really confining him, were you?"</p>
<p>Lee Seolhwa, who had just brought a cart with iron bars, tilted her head and asked.</p>
<p>Where on earth did she get something like that? No matter how you look at it, it looks like it's being used to confine laboratory animals.</p>
<p>Yoo Sangah shook her head as if she could not stop her.</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung asked.</p>
<p>"That little guy, he’s not understanding what we’re saying, is he?"</p>
<p>"He understands."</p>
<p>The other party members noticed Yoo Joonghyuk's answer and surrounded me.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi, is that really you?"</p>
<p>I wanted to answer, but no voice came out.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung seemed to have noticed something in my appearance.</p>
<p>"I guess he can’t speak."</p>
<p>"How about we do it this way? First of all, since you can hear what we’re saying, we’ll have you answer with your eyes. Every time we ask a question, you blink once if we’re right, and blink twice if we’re wrong. Little guy, you get it?"</p>
<p>It was a good idea.</p>
<p>"Wow, Jihye. We didn't know you could think like that?"</p>
<p>While Lee Gilyoung, who was instantly caught in a headlock, whined, Yoo Sangah settled the situation.</p>
<p>"Okay, then, shall we all calm down and ask questions? Since Dokja-ssi may be confused, ask questions one at a time. Um, shall we start with Gilyoung?"</p>
<p>Then Lee Gilyoung quickly escaped the headlock and approached. Lee Gilyoung looked at me with suspicious eyes and hesitantly opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"Dokja-hyung... is that you?"</p>
<p>The most important question for them.</p>
<p>Am I 'Kim Dokja' or not?</p>
<p>The depth of silence replaced their curiosity.</p>
<p>I blinked.</p>
<p>"Once… twice… huh? Three times?"</p>
<p>"Are you saying it’s true or not?"</p>
<p>"Isn’t it true that it can be both right and wrong?"</p>
<p>The group of people who were chatting about Lee Seolhwa’s words turned to me, holding their breath.</p>
<p>I blinked as if agreeing with that.</p>
<p>"Once! He blinked once!"</p>
<p>"Are you saying what Seolhwa unnie said is correct?"</p>
<p>"He is a Dokja, but he is not Dokja…"</p>
<p>After pondering for a moment, the group members seemed to accept the meaning of the words in their own way.</p>
<p>"What do you mean? Isn’t it hyung?"</p>
<p>"No, he’s right…"</p>
<p>"Well, the only guy left like this is still him."</p>
<p>"Guys, calm down. You can’t ask questions."</p>
<p>I felt strange. It was unfamiliar to me that there were people who showed such a variety of emotions just with my small reaction.</p>
<p>"Dokja-ssi’s condition is strange."</p>
<p>It was then that Lee Seolhwa, who was looking at me, suddenly approached me.</p>
<p>There were faint sparks all around me.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' Lv. 3 is unstable.]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the status of the story became unstable.</p>
<p>It was natural.</p>
<p>No matter how much [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] it is, it is impossible to cross worldlines.</p>
<p>An event that would never be possible without someone providing me with strong probability.</p>
<p>Perhaps soon [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] will be lifted and I will return to the 41st Round.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, Seolhwa-ssi. Please save him!"</p>
<p>"He’s not going to die. He’ll probably return to his original world."</p>
<p>"Ahjussi, don’t go back, stay with us a little longer. Please. You’ve only been there a little while."</p>
<p>"Shin Yoosoung."</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung did not listen to Yoo Sangah's dissuasion.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung looked back at the screen and held my hand tightly.</p>
<p>"I know you have a place to go to, and I know those people need you. But, but we also…"</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, perhaps because her throat was so tight, could not bear to speak.</p>
<p>But she could be heard clearly. Because I was now the 'Demon King of Salvation', and she was my incarnation.</p>
<p>"We need you too."</p>
<p>I wanted to say something.</p>
<p>Can I convey my feelings by blinking my eyes violently?</p>
<p>No, maybe I'm glad that blinking is all I can do.</p>
<p>"Yoo Sangah. Let’s calm down and listen to Dokja-ssi. Seolhwa-ssi, how much time do we have left?"</p>
<p>"It’s five minutes at most."</p>
<p>"Shin Yoosoung, is there anything you want to ask Dokja-ssi?"</p>
<p>At those words, everyone took a step back.</p>
<p>Everyone had a question on their face, but they were willing to give up their questions for Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung asked me as if she were understanding the feelings of those people.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi... why did you come here?"</p>
<p>A question I cannot answer.</p>
<p>Yoo Sangah lightly hugged the child's shoulder. On behalf of the trembling Shin Yoosoung, Yoo Sangah kindly changed her question.</p>
<p>"Did you miss us by any chance?"</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, who had lowered her head, looked up at me.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was the real question Shin Yoosoung really wanted to ask.</p>
<p>I looked at the face of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;.</p>
<p>「Let’s think that Kim Dokja is here now.」</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, Lee Gilyoung, Yoo Sangah, Lee Jihye, Lee Seolhwa, Yoo Joonghyuk… And even Han Sooyoung, who is not here.</p>
<p>I wanted to see their faces forever. I wanted to remember.</p>
<p>I blinked slowly, as if taking a picture.</p>
<p>"Ah."</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung’s eyes  filled with tears. Lee Gilyoung slowly lowered his head, and Lee Jihye turned her head away and muttered something unintelligible. Lee Seolhwa examined me with a light sigh. Yoo Joonghyuk still looked at me with incomprehensible eyes.</p>
<p>Yoo Sangah said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>I blinked twice, indicating that I did not deserve to hear such words.</p>
<p>Slowly, Yoo Sangah’s face got closer.</p>
<p>When her breath reached my ear, she whispered in a voice that only I could hear.</p>
<p>"I know. Dokja-ssi is not the 'Kim Dokja' we remember."</p>
<p>As expected, Yoo Sangah knew.</p>
<p>"Still, we think Dokja-ssi is Dokja-ssi. No one can deny that."</p>
<p>The person who still calls me 'Kim Dokja' even though I don’t even know how much percentage I have left.</p>
<p>Yoo Sangah’s face slowly moved away. In a very clear voice she opened her mouth.</p>
<p>"If it’s okay with you, Dokja-ssi, you can stay here."</p>
<p>For a moment I thought I heard wrong.</p>
<p>"We will provide the probability. As you can see, we are quite strong. Even so, we are all people who cleared the 'last scenario'."</p>
<p>A stir arose deep within my heart.</p>
<p>"Stay here. We’ll do something for the 41st Round."</p>
<p>What would happen if I really stayed here?</p>
<p>As she said, if only we could solve the 41st Round with their help.</p>
<p>"That's right, Dokja-ssi. We can help! All I have to do is possess myself! Lee Gilyoung isn't much help either, but he accessed that place as a Constellation and—"</p>
<p>"If you want, I will go and fight for you."</p>
<p>Their stories spoke to me.</p>
<p>[The story 'Kim Dokja Company' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>As the story began, I could clearly feel the white space between the lines supporting the sentences.</p>
<p>The abyss of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; that is never revealed to others.</p>
<p>I once again realized what they had lost to come here.</p>
<p>There were not many members of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; present.</p>
<p>Still, they didn't blame me.</p>
<p>They were just telling me that it would be okay as long as I stayed on the line they made.</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' frowns.]</p>
<p>What is so important about writing 'my story'?</p>
<p>What Han Sooyoung said may be wrong. Maybe I'm not qualified to talk about the 41st Round.</p>
<p>Above all, the 41st Round was the officially 'ended' story. No matter how hard I struggle, I cannot change the story.</p>
<p>Maybe staying here would be a better choice than wasting time on such useless things.</p>
<p>To spend the rest of my life serving those who find comfort in my presence—</p>
<p>「"Where is that guy?"」</p>
<p>When I looked up, a video was playing on the screen.</p>
<p>「"Find that guy’s carriage."」</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk was speaking in the 41st Round.</p>
<p>「"If we are to see the end of the 'Recycling Center', we definitely need him."」</p>
<p>If I give up here, what will happen to Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
<p>"Ahjussi?"</p>
<p>Even while I was here, Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st Round was fighting. He was running toward the end of a fleeting story that would ultimately fail.</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' grins.]</p>
<p>Seeing Yoo Joonghyuk like that, I finally understood Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>[The synchronization rate with your sponsor increases significantly.]</p>
<p>Kim Dokja, who did not stay in the 1,863rd round was finally convinced of his return to his own world.</p>
<p>"Yes? Ahjussi. Please stay here with me. Will you stay? Yes?"</p>
<p>I looked the child in the eyes. But nothing was seen. Because Shin Yoosoung’s small hands were covering my eyes.</p>
<p>"No. Don’t answer."</p>
<p>The hand that created the pitch-black darkness was trembling. Yoo Joonghyuk's voice was heard beyond the darkness.</p>
<p>"Listen carefully, Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk was speaking in a voice that did not show the slightest agitation.</p>
<p>"No matter what story you want, we will make it the ending we want. And you can’t stop it."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's turned back was seen between the child's fingers.</p>
<p>It is said that he fought with Odin.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was the one who protected the Demon King of Salvation and me beyond the 'Void Curtain'.</p>
<p>"Dokja-ssi."</p>
<p>Tsutsu, the air shook with sparks. The feeling that gently surrounded me was fading away.</p>
<p>[The signal of 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' becomes weaker.]</p>
<p>[Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint is finally about to be released.]</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung burst into tears once again, and Lee Gilyoung turned back. Lee Jihye took a step closer and held onto my arm.</p>
<p>Yoo Sangah said.</p>
<p>"Thank you for coming."</p>
<p>While listening to Yoo Sangah's voice, I thought about Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>"We’re okay. So, you, Dokja-ssi,  must definitely survive to the end."</p>
<p>But Kim Dokja was not there, and the only thing here was the helpless, blinking agent of the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p>The air swirled along with people's voices.</p>
<p>The world of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; was fading away.</p>
<p>I felt confident again.</p>
<p>「Kim Dokja would have wanted to return to his companions more than anyone else.」</p>
<p>Still, why didn't he come here?</p>
<p>Why did he have to leave the people he loved the most?</p>
<p>Then, a voice came from my fading consciousness.</p>
<p>【Do you really want to know?】</p>
<p>I could feel it instinctively.</p>
<p>【Even if the truth could destroy you forever?】</p>
<p>I know the owner of this voice.</p>
