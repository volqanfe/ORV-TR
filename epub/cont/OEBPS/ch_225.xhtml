<hr/>
<p>I had been asked a similar question a while ago.</p>
<p>【Do you really want to know? Even if the truth could ruin you forever?】</p>
<p>The owner of the voice said. You will be able to know the truth when you reach the final chapter of the 'Recycling Center'.</p>
<p>I wondered if that was what it meant.</p>
<p>「Why didn't Kim Dokja return to &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;?」</p>
<p>I was curious. Of course I couldn't help but be curious.</p>
<p>"Seonah-ssi, I won't absorb you."</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>"No matter how curious I am, I don't want to know the answer that way."</p>
<p>Goo Seonah wasn't someone I could call my colleague. There was a wall as thick as a piece of paper between her and me.</p>
<p>However, I understood her at least in the sentences written on that piece of paper.</p>
<p>Now I know who she was looking for in this world. I also know what kind of person she liked and what kind of sentences she loved. That's why I can't absorb her. Because I want her to exist as a reader who reads this story beyond the paper.</p>
<p>"I don't like that."</p>
<p>Goo Seonah said, glaring at my hand that was holding her shoulder.</p>
<p>"You don't do this. You don't do that. Do you still think this world is just a 'novel'?"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Do you think I absorbed other readers because I like it?"</p>
<p>Goo Seonah's eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>No reader wants to absorb the souls of other readers. Goo Seonah must have felt the same way.</p>
<p>"You know. Those who have already been branded as 'Kim Dokja fragments' are all being tracked by the Constellations."</p>
<p>Goo Seonah said, looking up at the sky.</p>
<p>Beyond that sky where lightning strikes, there were definitely nebulae waiting for us.</p>
<p>Those who are trying to control the dreams of this world by collecting 'Kim Dokja fragments'.</p>
<p>"The Recycling Center is protecting us now, but how long do you think that will be possible? They will soon start tracking us."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"This scenario is our last chance. Our last chance to protect ourselves. Here, as many 'Kim Dokja fragments' as possible must become one. We must become strong enough to stand against those Constellations in the sky."</p>
<p>Goo Seonah's mumbling words almost sounded like a spell.</p>
<p>"We must become a single 'Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>Maybe I knew that too.</p>
<p>But I spoke as if I was rebelling against that fact.</p>
<p>"That's not the only way. Why don't we join forces? Even if we don't become one, we can become a team."</p>
<p>"That's not enough. We're just ordinary people, except for the fact that we have Kim Dokja fragments."</p>
<p>"&lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; were also ordinary people at first."</p>
<p>"So we can do it too? Do you know what kind of novel this is?"</p>
<p>"It might become a novel someday."</p>
<p>Goo Seonah started laughing like crazy. Then, she suddenly stopped laughing and looked at me.</p>
<p>"As expected, you are 'Kim Dokja'."</p>
<p>The moment I turned around with an eerie feeling, her left hand, which had changed into something like a vice, grabbed my wrist.</p>
<p>Story fragment, 「Memory-biting Snake」.</p>
<p>I thought it was a second chance.</p>
<p>Could it be that this conversation was just a way to buy time to prepare for this?</p>
<p>I quickly activated 「Understanding of the Overthroned」.</p>
<p>[Memory-Biting Snake has no intention of harming you.]</p>
<p>The ability of 「Memory-biting Snake」 is to inject some of its own memories into others.</p>
<p>My vision slowly turned white.</p>
<p>Goo Seonah was faintly smiling in the midst of that.</p>
<p>"I'll make sure you remember clearly. What did you, 'Kim Dokja', do?"</p>
<p>A sentence slowly came to mind in the brightly colored sight.</p>
<p>「This is a story for that one reader.」</p>
<p>That memory starts from the last sentence of 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』 written by Han Sooyoung.</p>
<hr/>
<p>「I hope many people read this story.」</p>
<p>That was Kim Dokja's first wish.</p>
<p>So he left recommendations on the Internet and left comments. He went around recommending the same story to people.</p>
<p>He got cursed at.</p>
<p>At the time, he didn't understand. Why didn't they read all the interesting stories if they just endured a little?</p>
<p>Now he knows why.</p>
<p>The story that saved him wasn't salvation for others.</p>
<p>Accepting that simple fact was very difficult for Kim Dokja as a child.</p>
<p>「And that story caught the eye of one person.」</p>
<p>When he looked around, the first thing he saw was the bed in the hospital room. As his heart slowly beat repeatedlyt, the plan began to move throughout his body.</p>
<p>Those delicious things came to mind as an example. From the first scenario to the last.</p>
<p>Separating from the group on the subway, becoming a 'long-standing dream', and finally the moment when his soul disintegrated and scattered across the universe, all of it.</p>
<p>"Ha—"</p>
<p>The voice flowing out didn't feel real. He didn't think he would be able to come back.</p>
<p>Still, he came back. He definitely came back.</p>
<p>「This is not a dream.」</p>
<p>Tears welled up with his overflowing emotions and his heart pounded hard.</p>
<p>「Han Sooyoung succeeded.」</p>
<p>He heard someone running outside the hospital room.</p>
<p>A familiar sound and a familiar voice. He wanted to kick the bed and hug them right away. He wanted to tell them that he missed them. But.</p>
<p>[Your current existence restoration is 41%.]</p>
<p>The system message that appeared before his eyes stopped his actions.</p>
<p>「His existence wasn't completely restored, was it?」</p>
<p>He recalled the events that had happened while reading 'Memories of the World.' One, his soul was completed as 'the Oldest Dream' and scattered throughout the universe.</p>
<p>Second. Han Sooyoung wrote a novel to be read by his soul fragments who were reincarnated throughout the universe.</p>
<p>Three, his reincarnated soul fragments read Han Sooyoung's novel and 'Kim Dokja' came to embrace them.</p>
<p>Four, the embrace of 'the oldest dream' became reality.</p>
<p>If that assumption was good, he should have been completely restored and become one Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>But now his soul's restoration is not 100%, not 51%, not 49%, but 41%.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja became anxious as he heard the footsteps of the approaching party.</p>
<p>「Am I what the party wants me to be now?」</p>
<p>「Do I have all my memories of them?」</p>
<p>That fear raised Kim Dokja's body. Although he could not use his full power as 'the oldest dream', he could search the entire world line and regain the remaining memories as he was now.</p>
<p>「Kim Dokja thought.」</p>
<p>Yes, let's recover the remaining lost memories before meeting the group.</p>
<p>「It'll only take a moment.」</p>
<p>It wasn't difficult to find the fragments of memory.</p>
<p>Once he started 'worldline exploration', the pieces that contained his memories were captured heading to 'a certain worldline' all at once.</p>
<p>He followed the flow and floated through the universe.</p>
<p>And finally, he reached the place where the memories were gathered.</p>
<p>The moment he witnessed the shape of the universe, Kim Dokja's heart raced again. It was because he knew where that place was.</p>
<p>「The forgotten 41st Round.」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja was genuinely surprised.</p>
<p>That was a world that even he, the 'Oldest Dream', didn't know about. In a sense, it was a world where existence itself could not be established.</p>
<p>A dream that the 'oldest dream' couldn't have. Because such a world could not exist. Even so, that world existed right before his eyes.</p>
<p>Even,</p>
<p>[Is this the 'Oldest Dream'?]</p>
<p>Someone showed intense hostility to him.</p>
<p>[I can't believe it, I really thought it would come...]</p>
<p>A thousand bees blocked his path.</p>
<p>Stars with dazzling lights that seemed like they could light up an entire galaxy.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja slowly looked around the vast army of stars and recognized the Constellations at the forefront. Kim Dokja knew who those stars were.</p>
<p>[Odin.]</p>
<p>Odin of &lt;Asgard&gt;.</p>
<p>[Zeus. Poseidon.]</p>
<p>Zeus and Poseidon of &lt;Olympus&gt;.</p>
<p>[Mithra.]</p>
<p>Even the Mythical Constellation Mithra of &lt;Vedas&gt;.</p>
<p>The masters of the most famous Nebulae in the &lt;Star Stream&gt; were there.</p>
<p>Normally, the Constellations would have been furious just by hearing their true names. However, no Mythical Constellation dared to object to Kim Dokja's words. The opponent was a 'god' who dreamed of this universe.</p>
<p>The concepts of a fairy tale or a myth had no meaning in front of the 'Oldest Dream'.</p>
<p>[I don't know why you blocked my path, but I'll say it once. Get out of the way.]</p>
<p>The Constellations of the nebulae trembled at the same time at Kim Dokja's words.</p>
<p>Even so, none of the stars moved. Rather, they seemed determined to protect their positions even if it meant burning all of their stories.</p>
<p>[That can't happen.]</p>
<p>It was questionable.</p>
<p>Even if it was a Myth-grade Constellation, there was no way it could refuse his orders. Was that a tribute to the star that had read the most stories in this world?</p>
<p>[Really? Then there's nothing I can do.]</p>
<p>In the end, the moment Kim Dokja raised his hand to clear the Constellations, a light spark flew from his fingertips.</p>
<p>Look at this?</p>
<p>Probability is the will of the Constellations that make up the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p>In other words, it meant that a strong flow that could cause an aftershock to him was restricting his actions.</p>
<p>[There must be a pretty great being behind you.]</p>
<p>Kim Dokja's eyes were filled with interest. A dazzling light swirled around in his hand, and a broken sword appeared.</p>
<p>'Unbreakable Faith'.</p>
<p>The mythical blade that accompanied his story finally revealed itself in the universe.</p>
<p>[If you want to stop it, stop it.]</p>
<p>Nothing can change his determination.</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; revived him. Therefore, he had a duty to return to them as a complete Kim Dokja. For them, Kim Dokja would do anything.</p>
<p>[Stop it!]</p>
<p>As Odin's chant and his sacred relic 'Gungnir' shot down like a meteor, Zeus, Astraphe and Kronos fell down after being struck by lightning.</p>
<p>The screams of the Constellations caught in the storm of stories spread out fiercely.</p>
<p>A joint attack by the highest gods of &lt;Asgard&gt; and &lt;Olympus&gt;. Kim Dokja took on the omnipotent attack that was enough to erase an entire world with just one sword.</p>
<p>Light exploded with a roar, and the longing for a cataclysmic upheaval that shook the entire topography of the universe continued.</p>
<p>In that scenery, Kim Dokja, covered in pitch-black star dust, smiled brightly.</p>
<p>[Kill him! He is just a Constellation!]</p>
<p>The Constellations did not give up and rushed forward. They were determined to block his path no matter what.</p>
<p>When Kim Dokja cut down one Constellation, two rushed forward, and when he cut down three, four rushed forward.</p>
<p>[The probability of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; is moving.]</p>
<p>It was impossible to destroy all the Constellations like this.</p>
<p>In the end, Kim Dokja frowned.</p>
<p>Even though he was the 'Oldest Dream', its power was now vaguely restored. If he used his power incorrectly here, he could get caught up in a probability aftermath and the entire nearby world line could evaporate.</p>
<p>It was best to quickly enter the '41st Round' while responding to the Constellations' power to an appropriate level.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja, who had made up his mind, activated [Way of the Wind].</p>
<p>[Let's go.]</p>
<p>They felt a wind blowing from somewhere, and with a momentary gesture, the canal of Constellations shook. Kim Dokja took advantage of the gap and moved. Faster than lightning or a meteor.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja, who had become a single gust of wind, managed to break through the nebula's net.</p>
<p>[Stop him!]</p>
<p>The weapons that had surged past Kim Dokja's body. Even with the snow flying instead of blood, Kim Dokja did not rest. He just had to go a little further. Just a little further—</p>
<p>「A story he doesn’t know is waiting.」</p>
<p>That’s how he finally touched the 'Void Curtain' of the world line.</p>
<p>[Up to there.]</p>
<p>Someone grabbed his wrist.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja looked down at the hand that was holding him and asked.</p>
<p>[It’s you. The one who moved the Constellations.]</p>
<p>Then the owner of the hand answered.</p>
<p>[Yes. It’s me.]</p>
<p>Kim Dokja slowly looked back at the being.</p>
<p>A being in this universe who dared touch his body and was safe. When he thought about it, there was only one such being.</p>
<p>[You came to find me, right?]</p>
<p>He was the clone he left behind in this world.</p>
<p>[Yes, I came to find you.]</p>
<p>49% of Kim Dokja.</p>
