<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">783 Episode 36 Real Kim Dokja (4)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>The air of the scenario he had been breathing for the first time in a while. Feeling the familiar yet unfamiliar density, Lee Gilyoung recalled the old advice of Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>「"That's right. Just breathe like that, exhale, and repeat slowly."」</p>
<p>It was the breathing method that Kim Dokja had taught Lee Gilyoung, who had once wanted to learn martial arts.</p>
<p>「"What kind of method is this?"」</p>
<p>When asked, Kim Dokja scratched his cheek as if he was embarrassed and answered.</p>
<p>「"It's just a deep breath that I take before reading a book. It helps me concentrate."」</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk criticized him for saying, "The teachings of a fool who doesn't even know martial arts," but after that, Lee Gilyoung often recalled that breathing method whenever something happened.</p>
<p>Inhale slowly, exhale.</p>
<p>「"I think that each breath is engraved with a story."」</p>
<p>「"A story?"」</p>
<p>「"The story of people who lived before us."」</p>
<p>Breathing in the same way as someone you respect. The breath didn't make Lee Gilyoung particularly strong. However, just by following the breath, Lee Gilyoung felt like he had taken a step closer to Kim Dokja's world.</p>
<p>This is how Dokja hyung breathed and lived.</p>
<p>"Breathe slowly."</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung said as he patted Ye Hyunwoo's back as he exhaled roughly.</p>
<p>"Breathe, exhale. Keep going."</p>
<p>Watching Ye Hyunwoo slowly lose consciousness, Lee Gilyoung thought about the reason he had come to this scenario once again. The reason he had to endure the aftermath of probability  and the criticism of his colleagues to come here.</p>
<p>「Lee Gilyoung had something he wanted to ask Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>That's why he came without a plan.</p>
<p>He accepted the strange position called 'Old School' and came here even while accepting the scenario penalty.</p>
<p>However, once he actually came, he didn't know who to ask.</p>
<p>Who is the real Kim Dokja?</p>
<p>Is it this boy who resembles his hyung's younger self? Or is it that woman who gave off a similar vibe to his hyung? Or is it the man who resembles his hyung the most?</p>
<p>Or is it the monster who seems the furthest from his hyung but whose soul he can sense?</p>
<p>[The demon '73rd Demon King' is staring at you.]</p>
<p>The demon looking at him with blank eyes.</p>
<p>Looking at that demon, Lee Gilyoung realized what Lee Jihye said.</p>
<p>Maybe his only hyung is gone now.</p>
<p>[Who are you?]</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung asked the Constellation that was asking him.</p>
<p>"This is the question I want to ask. Why are you here?"</p>
<p>[Do you know who we are?]</p>
<p>"Hongik."</p>
<p>The moment he said that name, the Constellations' faces changed for the first time.</p>
<p>[The Nebula, who has not revealed its identity, reveals its name!]</p>
<p>[The Constellations of &lt;Hongik&gt; reveal their existence!]</p>
<p>[How do you know us?]</p>
<p>"It's strange that I don't know when such stories are flying around." Lee Gilyoung was not Kim Dokja, but he breathed and thought like Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>Then he was able to see the world like Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>He slowly blinked his eyes and felt their stories. In particular, the faint sound of drums coming from the Constellation that occupied their center.</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung opened his mouth as he listened to the sound that sounded like falling raindrops hitting the ground.</p>
<p>"The 'Master of Rain'?"</p>
<p>Master of Rain.</p>
<p>One of the three Narrative-grade Constellations that serve 'Seoninwanggeom', the owner of &lt;Hongik&gt;. The rain god who controls the rain in the sky at will—Woo Sa.</p>
<p>[You really know me.]</p>
<p>Woo Sa nodded, surprised by Lee Gilyoung’s keen eye.</p>
<p>[That’s right. I am the Master of Rain, 'Woo Sa'. Who are you?]</p>
<p>"I’m just a student who missed my graduation period."</p>
<p>Woo Sa pondered for a moment what that meant and then asked.</p>
<p>[What does that mean?]</p>
<p>"I don't know the details, but how did you guys get in here when you're not even students? The Recycling Center is probably closed."</p>
<p>[I have no obligation to answer a rude person.]</p>
<p>"Hmm. I see. So you borrowed the power of the ‘Founder’s Mother ' to get in? Oh, you don't have to answer. Judging from your expression, it's true."</p>
<p>&lt;Hongik&gt;'s Narrative-grade Constellation, Founder’s Mother —Ungnyeo.</p>
<p>Ungnyeo was closely related to &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; as she was born a bear.</p>
<p>What if Ungnyeo made a contract with &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; and thus borrowed the modifiers of the twelve branches in &lt;Heungui&gt;?</p>
<p>"Did you sneak in here by stealing the modifiers of the weaklings?"</p>
<p>[We didn't steal them. We—]</p>
<p>"Aha, you're in a cooperative relationship?"</p>
<p>The picture was roughly drawn.</p>
<p>The 'Recycling Center' was a playground woven by the Gourmet Association and the Management Bureau. In the end, in this scenario, the great Constellations of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac&gt; are bound to become playthings.</p>
<p>So the &lt;Twelve Zodiac&gt; also made a decision.</p>
<p>If they are just going to be playthings no matter what, they should borrow the power of other &lt;Nebulae&gt;. That way, they should find a way to achieve their long-cherished desires.</p>
<p>"Monkey That Fell From A Tree! Primordial Cow! Red Mountain Army!"</p>
<p>Gilyoung called out the names of the Twelve Zodiac Signs that had lent &lt;Hongik&gt; modifiers, one by one.</p>
<p>"Are you listening? You won't get what you want that way. How long are you going to live relying on other Nebulae? Why don't you think about standing up for yourself even once?"</p>
<p>With the sound of Tsut...sparks flew out from Woo Sa's body and the other Constellations.</p>
<p>&lt;Zodiac&gt; Constellations respond to Lee Gilyoung's words</p>
<p>[If you keep interfering with us, we have no choice but to eliminate you.]</p>
<p>"You? Me?"</p>
<p>[I don't know who you are—]</p>
<p>Woo Sa raised his hand toward the sky with those words. The dozen or so Constellations that had joined forces to attack the demon flew into the sky.</p>
<p>Only to eliminate one person, Lee Gilyoung.</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung said, looking at the shadows of the Constellations that filled the sky.</p>
<p>"That's right. It seems you don't know who I really am at all."</p>
<p>The Cheonchongun Sword that emerged from Lee Gilyoung's arms glowed. As the magical energy that gushed out from the boy's heart entered the sword, soon a strong energy of more than ten meters filled the air.</p>
<p>[What the—!]</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung is not good at swordsmanship.</p>
<p>He doesn't know martial arts properly, and he has never learned it.</p>
<p>However, he has seen things over his shoulder.</p>
<p>The way the people he admires fight.</p>
<p>When and how they swing their swords, how they use their magical energy, and how they control their strength. Lee Gilyoung saw all those scenes and replayed them countless times in his head.</p>
<p>One replay became two, and two soon became three, four, five. He replayed them again and again, how many times did he replay them?</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung thought.</p>
<p>「I think I can do it too.」</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung’s imitation.</p>
<p>「A trajectory that shatters the sky with one blow.」</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.</p>
<p>With a loud roar, the sword strike of Cheonjongun Sword split the sky. Woo Sa, who barely managed to block the sword strike while swinging both hands, shouted.</p>
<p>[Oh my God. Could it be that you—]</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung’s sword relentlessly cut the sky. It cut and cut again. It cut so hard that the sky really split. The screams of the Constellations echoed everywhere. The violent lightning struck and swallowed up even the screams of the Constellations.</p>
<p>[Woo Sa! I have never heard of such a monster—]</p>
<p>When one of the Constellations, who had become thoughtful, shouted, Gilyoung stopped his sword for the first time.</p>
<p>"You were like that in our world line, and here, too, you are really disappointing."</p>
<p>The Constellations fell like hail, making a sound like corn.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four. The Constellations that lost limbs to the swordsmanship cried out in pain.</p>
<p>Gilyoung looked down at the Constellations and said.</p>
<p>"How long are you going to live only coveting the stories of future generations? You have many good stories too."</p>
<p>[What?]</p>
<p>"What you call 'showing us a good example for future generations'. Isn't that the spirit of Hongik?"</p>
<p>Woo Sa looked down at the fallen Constellations. Although some had lost arms or legs, none of the construction had suffered fatal blows to their bodies.</p>
<p>The attacks clearly avoided vital points.</p>
<p>Woo Sa looked down at the Constellations and at Gilyoung, who still had not put away his sword.</p>
<p>Woo Sa hesitated for a moment and asked.</p>
<p>[Could it be that you are a friend of the 'Oldest Dream'?]</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung slowly nodded.</p>
<p>Woo Sa muttered with a sigh.</p>
<p>[Were the words of the Myth-grade Constellations true...?]</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>[Thank you for showing mercy in my hand, friend of the Oldest Dream.]</p>
<p>At Woo Sa's signal, the incarnations of the Constellations all released their possessions.</p>
<p>「The context of the misaligned modifiers returned to their proper places.」</p>
<p>The Constellations of &lt;Hongik&gt; that had entered the 'Recycling Center' by borrowing modifiers were returning to their original places one by one.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, and give my regards to the Mother of the Founder."</p>
<p>Until the last moment, Woo Sa looked at Lee Gilyoung with a dumbfounded expression, but he disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Only after Woo Sa's figure completely disappeared did Lee Gilyoung finally let out a breath.</p>
<p>"Thank goodness he's a guy who can communicate."</p>
<p>Is it because of the scenario penalty? Even though he only used his magic power for a moment, the penalty was enormous.</p>
<p>[The scenario penalty will consume your entire body!]</p>
<p>If Woo Sa had really rushed in, Lee Gilyoung would have had no choice but to release the limit.</p>
<p>If that had happened, there would have been a big problem with the probability of this world line. Anyway, he thought he could take a breather with this.</p>
<p>[That’s amazing.]</p>
<p>Clap, clap, clap— Applause resounded. When he turned his head to where the sound came from, someone was standing there.</p>
<p>[As expected, it’s the &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; that lives up to its reputation.]</p>
<p>A unique sarcastic tone of speech.</p>
<p>An incarnation wearing a pitch-black cloak like Lee Gilyoung was there.</p>
<p>[After intimidating the Constellations with the bare minimum of force to suppress the aftershock, you sent them back with just your words… If Kim Dokja had seen it, it would have been a sight he would have praised.]</p>
<p>"You."</p>
<p>A much more terrifying magic flowed out from Lee Gilyoung's entire body.</p>
<p>"Asmodeus."</p>
<p>With those words, Gilyoung's new form disappeared. Gilyoung's right hand, which shot out like lightning, collided with Asmodeus's left hand. A rough magic wave exploded, and the two new forms moved away at the same time.</p>
<p>"You planned it? My hyung ended up like this—"</p>
<p>[Hmm? Who are you referring to when you say 'hyung'?]</p>
<p>Asmodeus answered with a dark smile.</p>
<p>[There are so many of your 'hyungs' here.]</p>
<p>"Where is Sooyoung? Wasn't Sooyoung's disappearance your doing?"</p>
<p>[Oh my, Han Sooyoung died because of me?]</p>
<p>"Sooyoung's not dead!"</p>
<p>[She died crushed by her own sins.]</p>
<p>Gilyoung swung his Cheonchongun Sword with a sigh.</p>
<p>Asmodeus smiled after confirming the magic contained in the sword strike.</p>
<p>[You’ve become quite skilled at handling magic. But isn’t this your limit?]</p>
<p>As Asmodeus lightly snapped his fingers, a dozen or so high-level demons hiding in the bushes rushed in.</p>
<p>They were Constellations belonging to the Gourmet Association.</p>
<p>Gilyoung asked mockingly.</p>
<p>"Are you trying to deal with me like that?"</p>
<p>[Why? It won’t work?]</p>
<p>"It seems you’ve forgotten who I am."</p>
<p>The high-level demons rushing in were all individuals that could not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Gilyoung didn’t hesitate any longer.</p>
<p>"Release the limit."</p>
<p>It didn’t matter if it caused a probability aftershock. If they don’t eliminate Asmodeus here right now, they’ll have bigger problems later.</p>
<p>Gilyoung decided that.</p>
<p>'Help me!' He asked his sponsor.</p>
<p>The demon who was once his sponsor.</p>
<p>‘The Ruler of the Bottomless Pit.’ As soon as the power of a Mythical Constellation radiated through his entire body, the &lt;Star Stream&gt;, which had detected the abnormality, reacted.</p>
<p>[The &lt;Star Stream&gt;'s probability is moving!]</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung also knew. If he uses this power, his incarnation body will also be in danger.</p>
<p>But if it's just for a moment.</p>
<p>If he kills Asmodeus and sweeps away the Constellations of the Gourmet Association in this moment.</p>
<p>Kukuaquaquaquaqua!</p>
<p>Hellish yellow locusts poured out from Lee Gilyoung's left hand. Yellow worms of the demon god that devour all living things in the world.</p>
<p>[No, I know who you are. Lee Gilyoung.]</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>[Insect Lord. Ruler of the Kings of the Cultivated. Contractor of the Demon God Abaddon!]</p>
<p>Asmodeus was laughing.</p>
<p>[Hahahaha! Confined Demon God! Go wild more! Soak yourself in the atmosphere of the scenario you have returned to after a long time!]</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung's expression hardened. Lee Gilyoung, sensing something was wrong, grabbed his left hand with his right to retrieve the yellow insects.</p>
<p>"Abaddon."</p>
<p>But Abaddon did not stop.</p>
<p>"Abaddon! Stop! Abaddon!"</p>
<p>The yellow insects that poured out soon devoured the Constellations and even the incarnation of Asmodeus. And soon, they began to rush toward the '73rd Demon King' who was looking at them from afar.</p>
<p>"No! Abaddon! Stop! Stop!"</p>
<p>The yellow insects that rushed in began to gnaw at the Great Demon's entire body.</p>
<p>"You, he is not the enemy! He is not the enemy!"</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung struck his left hand that was pouring out the yellow insects, and struck it again. How many times did he strike?</p>
<p>Only after his left hand became covered in blood did the yellow insects that were pouring out slowly stop moving.</p>
<p>But the Great Demon's entire body was already covered in a swarm of yellow insects.</p>
<p>"Hyung."</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung approached him like a crazy person.</p>
<p>That couldn't be happening. He didn't come to this world to see this.</p>
<p>That was when the sky collapsed and the gigantic dam of probability burst.</p>
<p>A huge aftershock of probability was blowing around the place where the Great Demon was.</p>
<p>「The &lt;Star Stream&gt; always balances the scales.」</p>
<p>Abaddon is a 'Mythical-grade Constellation'.</p>
<p>Now that Lee Gilyoung has manifested this power, the &lt;Star Stream&gt; will move the scales that are appropriate for his status.</p>
<p>There were no Constellations moving beyond the sky. No one outside of this scenario dared to step onto the scale opposite to the Demon God Abaddon.</p>
<p>Still, his left hand trembled uncontrollably. The Demon God coiled inside him was warning him.</p>
<p>「Run away, kid.」</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung had never heard Abaddon say that.</p>
<p>[The demon '73rd Demon King' is rising in status!]</p>
<p>A dazzling light began to flow out between the yellow insects along with a message coming from somewhere.</p>
<p>[The demon '73rd Demon King' rises in rank!]</p>
<p>[The demon '73rd Demon King' rises in rank!]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>How many times did the same message ring out? The nearby yellow insects melted away, and something was seen walking out of the grave of insects.</p>
<p>「The one who was on the other side of this scenario from the beginning.」</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung blankly watched the scene.</p>
<p>[The demon 'Demon King of Salvation' descends!]</p>
<p>Time seemed to pass slowly. His heart pounded violently.</p>
<p>There was the one he had wanted to see so badly.</p>
<p>The Demon King, who was none other than the one he remembered, was there.</p>
<p>"It's been a long time, Gilyoung."</p>
<p>He felt dizzy the moment he heard the voice. The boy's heart was testifying. His hyung was there.</p>
<p>"You've grown up well."</p>
<p>But the moment he thought of that, Lee Gilyoung felt terrible fear.</p>
<p>"Hyung, no."</p>
<p>He wanted to see Kim Dokja. But on the other hand, he didn't want to meet him here.</p>
<p>This was because Lee Gilyoung knew better than anyone what it meant for the being that disappeared in this &lt;Star Stream&gt; to return.</p>
<p>[The scenario content has been updated!]</p>
<p>The Demon King smiled as if he understood the boy and asked.</p>
<p>"Do you still remember how to deal with a Demon King?"</p>
