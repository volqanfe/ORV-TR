<hr/>
<p>Anyway, since I came this far, I had to meet the ark of the Beggar Sect.</p>
<p>Our goal is to find a cure for Jung Eunho.</p>
<p>If this place is really the Beggar Sect of Murim, no matter how degraded it may be, there will be some useful spirits.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon said.</p>
<p>"Let's go together."</p>
<p>"I'm going alone now. Please take care of Eunho in the meantime."</p>
<p>"If anything happens, call me right away, you know?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>If it was normal, of course I would have moved with Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>But this time it was difficult.</p>
<p>Because now I'm someone’s disciple, and Kyrgios's disciple isn't frightened by the Beggar Sect.</p>
<a href="#note1" epub:type="noteref">[NOTE 1]</a><p>"I'll take this guy with me."</p>
<p>I said, pointing at the spotted boy, our hostage.</p>
<p>The guy seemed to have resigned himself, but now he was in a compliant state.</p>
<p>"Go all the way over there."</p>
<p>At the end of the opening, I started walking along the path to the waiting room.</p>
<p>It was then that the spotted boy on my back opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"Mister."</p>
<p>"Uh."</p>
<p>"It's useless even if you take me. A person like me is worthless as a hostage."</p>
<p>I paused, then put the spotted boy on the floor and untied the knots from his hands and feet.</p>
<p>The puzzled boy looked up at me.</p>
<p>"Are you freeing me?"</p>
<p>I replied with a grin.</p>
<p>"You said you weren't worth being a hostage."</p>
<p>"I. Can I run away?"</p>
<p>"Do you want to?"</p>
<p>The spotted boy bowed his head.</p>
<p>After all, this boy knows it too. There is no place in this world for children to run away to.</p>
<p>Scenarios are hell everywhere.</p>
<p>The only thing this boy who didn't have great abilities could do was to dig a trap using his fucked up appearance.</p>
<p>"Your father, I heard that person suddenly changed."</p>
<p>The startled boy raised his head.</p>
<p>"How has it changed? Please explain."</p>
<p>"Just. All of a sudden, he was a completely different person."</p>
<p>"His appearance has changed?"</p>
<p>"His appearance is the same. The behavior of the homeless is the same."</p>
<p>The boy hesitated and continued.</p>
<p>"My dad was homeless, but he wasn't a bad guy. He ruined his business and went bankrupt and lost all of his money, but he wasn't one to hurt anyone."</p>
<p>The closer he got to the waiting room, the more the spotted boy stuttered.</p>
<p>"It all changed by touching that strange stone…"</p>
<p>Strange stone?</p>
<p>Soon after, the waiting room at Seoul Station, covered with a huge cloth, appeared.</p>
<p>It looked as if a relief camp had been set up in the center of Seoul Station.</p>
<p>Therein lies the Ark of the Beggar Sect.</p>
<p>I went inside and into the tent with the shivering spotted boy.</p>
<p>In the center of the tent, there was a huge stone on the floor, and just below the stone were the tables and chairs of the broken waiting room.</p>
<p>The ark of the Beggar Sect was sitting in one of the chairs drinking tea.</p>
<p>As if someone is enjoying this cataclysmic time leisurely.</p>
<p>Even knowing that I had appeared in the tent, he continued to sip his tea without being conscious of me.</p>
<p>"There's something strange about the tea here."</p>
<p>Then the four beggars who were guarding him bowed their heads.</p>
<p>"The tea I used to know doesn't taste like this."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. That was all I could get here."</p>
<p>"It can't be helped."</p>
<p>The Ark sniffed once again.</p>
<p>"Just as the Murim we remembered has disappeared, the scent of the tea that people talk about has changed."</p>
<p>I felt like I was suddenly in the middle of a martial arts novel.</p>
<p>Obviously, the place and time are different. This place was far from Murim.</p>
<p>Even so, the moment he opened his mouth, this place became Murim.</p>
<p>No matter where he is, he is a being who can change the scenery around him with just his words.</p>
<p>"Don't stand there, come over and sit down. Welcome to the Beggar Sect."</p>
<p>This place is truly the 'Beggar Sect'.</p>
<p>I felt that way all over again.</p>
<p>"Excuse me."</p>
<p>I sat on the opposite side of the ark with a nonchalant look.</p>
<p>As I sat down, Ark asked, sipping a sip of tea.</p>
<p>"Why did you bring that child?"</p>
<p>The spotted boy who caught his gaze shook his shoulders.</p>
<p>I said as I lightly wrapped my arms around the child's shoulders.</p>
<p>"Ah. A hostage."</p>
<p>"Hostage?"</p>
<p>After all, no matter how you look at it, it wasn't the way he looked at his own child.</p>
<p>I added a word.</p>
<p>"You have a brave son."</p>
<p>Only then did the Ark's eyes change.</p>
<p>The Ark looked at the spotted boy carefully and said.</p>
<p>"All the children of the Beggar Sect are brave. Even with their grandparents and begging for food on the street, they take care of themselves."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"I don't know what you expected, but I don't think I'm going to give you any special treatment just because you're my son. From the moment you enter this group, the distinction between a child and an adult is meaningless. We're just beggars living under the same sky as a roof."</p>
<p>I said while holding the spotted boy's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Beggars are children, and adults are adults."</p>
<p>"From the point of view of the universe, the two are not very different."</p>
<p>It was a plausible statement to hear.</p>
<p>But that was not something that could be said from a human's point of view.</p>
<p>"From a star’s point of view, that might be the case."</p>
<p>The spotted boy said that his father suddenly became 'another person'.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Character List' is activated!]</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">&lt;Character information&gt;</h3>
<p>Name: Myung Sewoon</p>
<p>Age: 44</p>
<p>Sponsor: The Last Ruler</p>
<p>Exclusive Attributes: Homeless (Normal), Murim (Rare)</p>
<p>Exclusive Skills: [Camping Lv.3], [Fishing Lv.3], [Verse Lv.3]...</p>
<p>Stigma: [Punching stick Lv.3]...</p>
<p>Overall stats: [Stamina Lv.25], [Strength Lv.25], [Agility Lv.25], [Magic Power Lv.25]</p>
<p>Comprehensive Evaluation: This person acts as a proxy for the will of the last ruler.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>An incarnation with decent overall abilities.</p>
<p>However, what really bothered me was the comprehensive evaluation, not the comprehensive ability.</p>
<p>「A proxy of the constellation's will is.」</p>
<p>Is it some kind of possession? But can it?</p>
<p>There's no way a constellation-class existence could possess an incarnation from the beginning of the scenarios.</p>
<p>I tested my luck.</p>
<p>"Why is a constellation here? The last ruler. This place is not Murim."</p>
<p>Constellation 'The Last Ruler'.</p>
<p>If the record of 'Ways of Survival' is correct, the Beggar Sect was kicked out of Murim after being defeated by Kyrgios and the Pajeon Swordsman in &lt;The 2nd Murim&gt; and &lt;The 3rd Murim&gt;.</p>
<p>Then, the 'last ruler' refers to the last 'Ark' of the Beggar Sect.</p>
<p>There was no mistake.</p>
<p>In other words, what is controlling the incarnation in front of me right now is.</p>
<p>「The leader of the Beggar Sect that became a constellation.」</p>
<p>The Ark completely opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"You are an interesting young man. Did you find out that far already?"</p>
<p>The moment the Ark put the teacup down, the air around him changed.</p>
<p>I knew it instinctively.</p>
<p>The pressure I felt from the Ark right now was at least a '6th-grade monster'.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am the dragon head ark of the Beggar Sect."</p>
<p>Is it an illusion? With that declaration, it really seemed like the signboard of the Beggar Sect could be seen behind him.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is his story.</p>
<p>Murim's prestigious political faction, which has been around for over a thousand years, is the Beggar Sect.</p>
<p>I saw a flag flying behind his back.</p>
<p>A purple flag.</p>
<p>The flag of 'Capture the Flag' starts with white, passes through red, indigo, brown, and purple, and finally ends in black.</p>
<p>However, the ark in front of my eyes obtained a purple flag not long after the scenario began.</p>
<p>I don't know, but all the representatives of the Seoul Station area must have died at the hands of the Beggar Sect.</p>
<p>It's such a horrifying growth that even Yoo Joonghyuk would be wary.</p>
<p>I was genuinely curious.</p>
<p>If he appeared in 'Ways of Survival', then by whom did he change his name?</p>
<p>I spoke calmly.</p>
<p>"I don't understand. Why did you rush into the incarnation's pastime with the stature of a great star?"</p>
<p>In fact, from the existence of the possessed body of the constellation in this initial scenario, the probability of the scenario should not allow this to happen.</p>
<p>"It's a great star. You seem to know a lot about constellations."</p>
<p>The Ark laughed.</p>
<p>"Are you also a being who knows the future?"</p>
<p>I wanted to faint for a moment.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, Sergeant Jung Munho was caught and said that he blew on this and that.</p>
<p>"That friend told me an interesting story. This world is actually in a story, and we are all characters in that story."</p>
<p>No, what are you talking about, dear reader.</p>
<p>"I thought it was an interesting analogy. I've often had similar thoughts."</p>
<p>Fortunately, the famous ark of the Beggar Sect seemed to accept reality as it is as a metaphor.</p>
<p>"If this is really a story, what kind of story will remain of my 'Beggar Sect'? Is the history of the 'Beggar Sect' over now? Is it remembered as a den of mere beggars that is no longer talked about by people?"</p>
<p>It was a voice of deep remorse.</p>
<p>A faint scent wafted from the half-remaining dragon's teacup. It had such a faded scent that it was hard to tell what kind of tea leaves it was made from.</p>
<p>"I just took a chance. A chance to start over again. A chance to stir up the narrative once again and the Beggar Sect to be remembered in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;."</p>
<p>Got a chance. By whom?</p>
<p>Who can provide the probability that the existence of a constellation class can interfere at the beginning of the scenarios?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>All I know is that I have to stop this crazy beggar.</p>
<p>"Then you came to the wrong place."</p>
<p>"I also gave up a lot in return. Can you feel the status of a constellation from me now?"</p>
<p>I thought it was strange.</p>
<p>The Ark was obviously strong, but he wasn't comparable to a constellation.</p>
<p>If he really had the status of a constellation, the moment I met him, I would have burst out of my limbs, unable to withstand the pressure of the story.</p>
<p>"Let's get to the main topic. Hey, I heard you're a disciple of Kyrgios."</p>
<p>The Ark's eyes sank coldly. I knew it instinctively. This confrontation is real from now on.</p>
<p>"Can you prove it?"</p>
<p>Of course, I am not his disciple, so there are no mortuary tablets or holy relics to prove it.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.5' is activated!]</p>
<p>Fortunately, I know a real disciple of Kyrgios.</p>
<p>「I am Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>The moment I thought that sentence, I felt like I had truly become a disciple of Kyrgios.</p>
<p>I was not afraid of anything.</p>
<p>The smallest is the greatest.</p>
<p>And I want to hit Yoo Joonghyuk in the back of the head. Perhaps they felt the atmosphere, and the complexion of the beggars lined up behind the Ark changed.</p>
<p>The last point was [White and Blue Steel], which LiteratureGirl64 passed on to me.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'White and Blue Steel Lv.1' is activated!]</p>
<p>Sensing bluish magic flowing from my body, Ark opened his eyes wide.</p>
<p>He said, "You really were Kyrgios’s disciple."</p>
<p>The beggars who were guarding him from behind were also greatly agitated.</p>
<p>"Really, his apprentice came here... do you know what that means?"</p>
<p>A subtle sense of intimidation spread subtly.</p>
<p>I grinned.</p>
<p>"I know. And I know that my acquaintances have been strengthened through your actions."</p>
<p>"So?"</p>
<p>I wanted to be able to say this.</p>
<p>But my mouth is already out of my control.</p>
<p>Because I was that Kim Dokja now.</p>
<p>"Give me the Summoning Team Sirog."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is amazed at your spirit.]</p>
<p>Kim Dokja, the living voice of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>"Summoning team? Why did you come to the Beggar Sect to find Shaolin's Elixir?"</p>
<p>"If there is no summoning group, the suicide squad or whatever is fine. In any case, give me an elixir that can heal internal wounds."</p>
<p>The ark opened his mouth as if he was dumbfounded by my words.</p>
<p>"Is that all?"</p>
<p>"No, I have one more business."</p>
<p>I also wanted to cover my mouth.</p>
<p>What was in front of my eyes was a crazy constellation turned into a beggar, and my head could burst if I kept talking.</p>
<p>However, I was very firm.</p>
<p>"Give me that flag, too."</p>
<p>Because I was a crazy Kim Dokja now.</p>
<p>"Otherwise, next time our master will find this place himself."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' nods happily.]</p>
