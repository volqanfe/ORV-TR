<hr/>
<p>The 'Absolute Throne' was shining in the distance.</p>
<p>A seat where only one king can sit.</p>
<p>At one time, Han Sooyoung also wanted to sit in that seat. She believed that if she sat down there, she would be compensated for all the sorrow she had endured.</p>
<p>That was until she realized that even that desire was nothing more than a play for the constellations.</p>
<p>[A significant number of constellations are aware of your presence.]</p>
<p>[Very few constellations are concerned about your intervention.]</p>
<p>[Some constellations are requesting the Bureau to review your probability.]</p>
<p>She could feel the gaze of the stars across the distant sky.</p>
<p>Will the stars understand her story now?</p>
<p>[A constellation that has not yet revealed its modifier is looking at you.]</p>
<p>What she wanted was farther and farther away than that throne.</p>
<p>It was so distant that she couldn't quite tell what it was.</p>
<p>「She had no reason to intervene in this situation.」</p>
<p>This was the 41st round’s normal development.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, in the 41st round, will take the 'absolute throne' and walk the path of a supreme king who rules over everything.</p>
<p>No one will be able to stand on the same level as him.</p>
<p>No path will arise for him.</p>
<p>「Just leave it alone.」</p>
<p>If she just sat back and watched, the 41st round would end up in failure.</p>
<p>At the end of this story, Yoo Joonghyuk, in despair, will send Shin Yoosoung to the past.</p>
<p>That ends the story of this world line.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja will return to her again after reading all of her stories.</p>
<p>He has to come back.</p>
<p>For his sake, she must not move. Not write even a single sentence.</p>
<p>She has to let the characters move and flow. She knew it well. But why?</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk. If you sit over there, it’s all over."</p>
<p>Did she finally pick up the pen?</p>
<p>"You guessed it too, right? What the absolute throne is."</p>
<p>Of course, she knows the answer.</p>
<p>Even now, when she closes her eyes, the memory comes to mind clearly. It may be because she saw something she shouldn't have seen.</p>
<p>「"What you’re trying to do is not end the story, but give up."」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja, whom she ignored. Kim Dokja, who did not want to be reborn as Kim Dokja again.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Kim Dokja had to return to this story again.</p>
<p>She found Kim Dokja and that's why she's here now.</p>
<p>"Are you Han Sooyoung?"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st round was looking at her.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung asked bitterly.</p>
<p>"Who told you my name?"</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung quietly stared at the Yoo Joonghyuk from the 41st round.</p>
<p>"I owed you a beating last time."</p>
<p>This was her second fight with Yoo Joonghyuk in the 41st round.</p>
<p>"Do you think this time will be different?"</p>
<p>"It will be different."</p>
<p>"It looks like your learning ability is poor. If you’ve ever fought, you’d know that, right? It’s not for me."</p>
<p>On the rooftop of the theater dungeon, she bumped into Yoo Joonghyuk once.</p>
<p>She risked the odds and drew on her story, and she took advantage of the weakness of 'regressive depression' to subdue Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>But is that possible this time too?</p>
<p>She couldn't figure it out.</p>
<p>"Well, you must have regressed more than 40 times."</p>
<p>She didn't know, so she deliberately provoked him. She tried to spy on the guy's reaction, but Yoo Joonghyuk didn't come over. His eyes, deep as the sea of ​​silk, just stared at her.</p>
<p>All surrounding sounds disappeared.</p>
<p>Tension weighing heavily on the area. Silence where not a single insect cries.</p>
<p>The one who moved first was Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p>The sound of something being pushed away was heard one step later, and his black spear and her white sword clashed in the air.</p>
<p>Her magical power and his physical power intertwined, and a tearing sound rose through the rain clouds.</p>
<p>She lost.</p>
<p>Kaaaaang!</p>
<p>A lightning-like dramatic impact weighed heavily on Han Sooyoung. Let's believe in her spirit and her skills. Yoo Joonghyuk opened his  mouth.</p>
<p>"It seems you also know about regression."</p>
<p>"So are you surprised?"</p>
<p>"I expected it."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk spoke without even raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Because there were a lot of strange people in this round."</p>
<p>Strange guys. Han Sooyoung knew who he was referring to.</p>
<p>"Everyone said they knew me."</p>
<p>Her sharp emotions were buried at the end of her words. The anger of the returner who had been forged again and again was condensing.</p>
<p>[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'’s 'Spiritual Soul Height Lv.10' is activated!]</p>
<p>Black magical power swirled in the gravitational force of the spear.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung’s expression hardened at the creepy waveform of magical power.</p>
<p>From now on, it's real.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung took her chances and opened up her own stories.</p>
<p>With the sound of her striking the black flame dragon's holy soul drum, which made her called her special flame black dragon Emperor, the pole pole filled with her [Earth and Soul Field] and the dot pole filled with [special flame] collided.</p>
<p>She was Han Sooyoung and she was confident.</p>
<p>Even though Yoo Joonghyuk was a powerful martial artist, there was no way he could stand up to her.</p>
<p>Coo coo coo coo!</p>
<p>A magic wave that turns one side of the sky pitch black.</p>
<p>The first to be pushed out was Han Sooyoung. Han Sooyoung's expression was so disgusted that she cried and swallowed the blood that came up her throat.</p>
<p>'Nonsense.'</p>
<p>No matter how the aftereffects of probability were, she was the one who saw the end of the scenarios twice.</p>
<p>The Yoo Joonghyuk floating in the sky right now was only Yoo Joonghyuk from the 41st round.</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p>「"Don’t underestimate me in the 41st round."」</p>
<p>One step too late, the advice of her fellow regressor came to mind.</p>
<p>「"It’s only the 41st round, so what?"」</p>
<p>「"His character may be different."」</p>
<p>This world was not even recorded in Ways of Survival.</p>
<p>In a sense, it is a world line that writer Han Sooyoung does not really know.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk lived a 41-rounds life that no one recorded.</p>
<p>That Yoo Joonghyuk was speaking.</p>
<p>"Do you know me too?"</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung bit her lip.</p>
<p>「She said, "You are the one who sent Shin Yoosoung to the past because you thought you couldn’t do it alone. How strong can a guy who gave up so easily be?"」</p>
<p>「"That’s the problem."」</p>
<p>「"What?"」</p>
<p>「"There is no way I could have collapsed that much in only the 41st round."」</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung looked at Yoo Joonghyuk. He was telling the story embedded in his whole body.</p>
<p>That story is proof of his life.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung slowly felt a chill go down her spine.</p>
<p>「"In that world line, I have given up on the possibility of the next round. I probably saw a despair that I couldn't overcome no matter how hard I tried. I concluded that I, who can return on my own, cannot see the end without sending Shin Yoosoung to another world line."」</p>
<p>Looking at Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes, Han Sooyoung thinks about the regressor.</p>
<p>the world, excluding the regressor, regresses.</p>
<p>The soul of the regressor continues to age and memories accumulate.</p>
<p>Touching and sick heart.</p>
<p>Endless depression and madness.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung also knew.</p>
<p>Regression was not a curse that an ordinary human could bear, and Yoo Joonghyuk was not an ordinary human.</p>
<p>Steel-like mentality and unwavering spirit. Yoo Joonghyuk is a person who is so strong that he cannot be described simply as 'strong'.</p>
<p>A protagonist created to endure a number of 1,863 regressions.</p>
<p>「"If I made such an extreme judgment in only the 41st round."」</p>
<p>The 'main character' gave up his future in only the 41st round. And he tied the future to his past self.</p>
<p>「"That guy did his best to the point where he couldn’t survive his next life."」</p>
<p>"It seems you don’t know."</p>
<p>A story arose.</p>
<p>It's an endlessly cancerous and ominous story that they don't know when or how it was acquired.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung thought.</p>
<p>Really strong. It's hard to believe that it's the 41st round. He seems stronger than any other 'Yoo Joonghyuk' who lived through the fourth scenario.</p>
<p>If she uses Kim Dokja Company's story, she can win. But if she does that…</p>
<p>[The &lt;Star Stream&gt; is reacting to your choices.]</p>
<p>This time, the probability of this world will not forgive her.</p>
<p>Ga-ga-ga-ga-gak!</p>
<p>Seeing Yoo Joonghyuk's sword flying, Han Sooyoung also swung her sword in front of her.</p>
<p>Once, twice, three times.</p>
<p>Every time her spear and sword clashed, the sound of her grip being torn apart could be heard.</p>
<p>Her blood flowed and her nerves became numb little by little.</p>
<p>Four times.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung finally lost her sword.</p>
<p>'Unbreakable Faith' broke and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>A moment's gap.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk did not hesitate. As if there was no place for her in this world, Yoo Joonghyuk threw out his spear with a cold motion.</p>
<p>A slow blow to the heart.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung looked down at her own wounds as if she couldn't believe it, and then looked up at Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>That was the last time.</p>
<p>It was a life-threatening wound that did not need to be repeated twice.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk retrieved his own spear the moment after seeing Han Sooyoung had disappeared.</p>
<p>"It hurts, kid."</p>
<p>A voice came from behind.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, startled, immediately tried to swing the spear backwards.</p>
<p>"Do you know how much memory loss there is once your avatar dies?"</p>
<p>Two small, soft hands wrapped around his head.</p>
<p>Tsutsutsutsuchut!</p>
<p>A dazzling spark and a terrible shock engulfed Yoo Joonghyuk's mind. Unable to withstand the aftermath, Yoo Joonghyuk's whole body trembled like an aspen tree.</p>
<p>The story in Han Sooyoung’s hands burrowed into Yoo Joonghyuk’s head.</p>
<p>「"The stronger the guy, the heavier the weight of his despair."」</p>
<p>This is what her colleague told her.</p>
<p>「"Probably, he will easily sink to just one feather."」</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung knew better than anyone else what the weakness of a regressor who experienced deep despair was.</p>
<p>[The gaint story, 'Kim Dokja’s Company' begins.]</p>
<p>His stomach churned and his whole body trembled as if he had been shocked.</p>
<p>"What do happy memories taste like, you bastard?"</p>
<p>Memories of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; flowed from her fingertips.</p>
<p>「"Why is that kid so good at cooking?"」</p>
<p>Memories of Kim Dokja and her stealing Yoo Joonghyuk's dishes and eating them.</p>
<p>Memories of the picnic where &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; gathered together and left. In their story that had not yet ended, Kim Dokja that she remembered was speaking.</p>
<p>「"Next time, let’s bring more beef."」</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung looked at the story blankly. The fact that such a time even existed now seemed unrealistic.</p>
<p>A person who can exist only in sentences.</p>
<p>The stories that were clearly her memories now seemed like lies in a novel written by someone else.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung smiled as she looked at Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes that had turned white.</p>
<p>"I’m about to die of happiness."</p>
<p>Happiness. As she pronounced that word, Han Sooyoung momentarily tilted her head.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>Is it because the avatar died and lost some of her memories? Han Sooyoung couldn't immediately remember the meaning of that word. Perhaps that wasn't all she had lost.</p>
<p>However, she trusted Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Lotus Flower Blooming Under the Moonlight' is watching you.]</p>
<p>Her companion who would remember those words for her.</p>
<p>「"I told you I’d try to persuade you. Are you ready to be persuaded?"」</p>
<p>Find a writer to write her story for her.</p>
<p>"You damn son of a bitch."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung finally understood her own actions, muttering a phrase that she would never use.</p>
<p>All writers were readers before they were writers, and Han Sooyoung was the same.</p>
<p>I'm curious about the story he makes. Even after all that hardship, he came back to this world, and the story he wanted to tell was.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Lotus Flower Blooming Under the Moonlight' looks at you with sad eyes.]</p>
<p>So she stopped Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' bows his head.]</p>
<p>She acted arbitrarily without consulting with other members of &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;.</p>
<p>"You think so too, Yoo Joonghyuk?"</p>
<p>Maybe because of her choice, she knew that all the plans she had made could go wrong.</p>
<p>Taking a light breath, Han Sooyoung lifted the stunned Yoo Joonghyuk onto her shoulder.</p>
<p>She didn't have much time left now.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk will wake up soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, she must destroy the 'Absolute Throne'.</p>
<p>Only then will this scenario end.</p>
<p>「But there was something she didn’t know.」</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung suddenly felt the hairs on the back of her hand stand up.</p>
<p>With a deafening sound, she heard the strange sound of a huge scale tipping from somewhere.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung immediately realized what was happening. She has participated in this scenario on other floating ships, so it is unlikely that the abnormality she caused would lead to a riot, but she did not expect the fallout to take this form.</p>
<p>The probability was running wild.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung opened her mouth without realizing it. She knew this feeling well.</p>
<p>"The 'Great Hall' opens."</p>
<p>A huge hole was opening beyond the black swirling sky.</p>
<p>[The gods of this world have noticed your presence!]</p>
<p>[The scales of probability are in equilibrium.]</p>
<p>The owner of the 'Absolute Throne' was appearing beyond the 'Great Hall of the Sky'.</p>
