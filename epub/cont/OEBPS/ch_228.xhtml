<hr/>
<p>There is a kind of secret information agency in &lt;Nebula Olympus&gt;. It is known to the world as the 'Hermes System'.</p>
<p>The core mission of the information agency is to collect big data and predict the 'big story'.</p>
<p>And to detect abnormal phenomena in lower scenarios in advance and eliminate elements that could pose a threat to &lt;Olympus&gt;.</p>
<p>[What happened to the Recycling Center?]</p>
<p>In response to Hermes' question, the information agency director 'First Hermaphrodite' confidently answered.</p>
<p>[It seems that the conquest will be over soon.]</p>
<p>[How?]</p>
<p>[I formed a team with the Historical-grade Constellations of the lower scenarios.]</p>
<p>Originally, the lower Constellations of &lt;Olympus&gt; were valuable resources to offset the probability of the scenario.</p>
<p>However, this time, since there was an issue , they had no choice but to replace the Historical-grade Constellations.</p>
<p>[The 'Recycling Center' will probably have restricted access by modifier.]</p>
<p>[I handled that part in a tricky way. Don't worry too much.]</p>
<p>[If It's a trick... ]</p>
<p>[It's a trick, but it's a safe way. I swear on my modifier.]</p>
<p>[Understood. You must obtain the 'Kim Dokja Fragment' there by all means. Otherwise, the Recorders will lose the right to record the 'only story'.]</p>
<p>As Hermes disappeared with a stern warning, the First Hermaphrodite— Hermaphroditus grumbled with a light sigh.</p>
<p>[Damn father. That's easier said than done.]</p>
<p>Of course, Hermaphroditus wasn't that worried even after saying that.</p>
<p>This was because the lineup of the special forces deployed to the 'Recycling Center' was by no means ordinary.</p>
<p>A raid force that included famous Constellations from the martial arts world, those who were sailors of the 'Argo' but whose fame was not widely known, and even forgotten Greek heroes.</p>
<p>With this level of power, even if a 'Narrative-grade Constellation' had appeared, it would have been enough to hunt them down.</p>
<p>No matter who was in the 'Recycling Center', it wouldn't be possible to stop them all.</p>
<p>[Who would be 'Kim Dokja'? I don't know who he is to do this, but…]</p>
<p>Even Hermaphroditus, the director of the Information Bureau, didn't know much about the name 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p>All she knew was that it was the real name of the 'Oldest Dream'.</p>
<p>That he was torn to pieces and scattered throughout the scenario area.</p>
<p>&lt;Olympus&gt; had to get their hands on the fragments before any other Constellation.</p>
<p>[An abnormality has occurred in the 'Hermes System'!]</p>
<p>That was when the Information Bureau's emergency light turned on. Hermaphroditus hurriedly ran to the situation room and called her secretary.</p>
<p>[What's going on?]</p>
<p>[That, that... I don't know for sure either!]</p>
<p>There were only three major incidents that had turned on the emergency light in the Hermes' system since she became the agent of the 'Hermes System'.</p>
<p>The first was when Hades, the 'Father of the Rich Night', and Poseidon, the 'Spear that Draws the Boundary of the Seas', collided.</p>
<p>The night sky reflected on the water. The dispute was over whether to acknowledge it as 'night' or 'sea', but fortunately, this was resolved well through Zeus' mediation.</p>
<p>The second time was when &lt;Olympus&gt;, &lt;Vedas&gt;, and &lt;Eden&gt; clashed over the copyright of the 'Resurrection Tale', but the situation that almost escalated into a war of nerves between Mythological Constellations was fortunately dramatically resolved with the appearance of copyright experts from each Constellation.</p>
<p>The last third time was when the 'Oldest Dream' was shattered.</p>
<p>Even she, the director of the Information Bureau, could only read a portion of the report related to this.</p>
<p>She only knew one thing for sure.</p>
<p>「That day, the 'Oldest Dream' they knew was discarded.」</p>
<p>Since the scale of the previous three incidents was enormous, Hermaphroditus couldn't help but be nervous the moment the emergency lights came on. The interval between flashes of the emergency lights shortened depending on the scale of the incident. For example, when the 'Oldest Dream' descended, the emergency lights flashed seven times per second, and when Hades and Poseidon collided, they flashed four times per second.</p>
<p>But this time, they flashed twice per second.</p>
<p>Judging from the flashing interval alone, the scale of the incident did not seem as large as the previous ones.</p>
<p>What was concerning was the color of the flashing lights.</p>
<p>'Yellow?'</p>
<p>Hermaphroditus's eyebrows furrowed as she looked.</p>
<p>The 'yellow light' was turned on when the 'Hermes System's' Information Bureau was in danger.</p>
<p>[Secretary!]</p>
<p>[Director! This way!]</p>
<p>Hermaphroditus ran straight to where the secretary's voice had been heard.</p>
<p>[Kueeeeek!]</p>
<p>The place where the screams were heard was the annex of the situation room. It was where the special department that had been in charge of the 'Recycling Center' attack was located a while ago.</p>
<p>[What the—]</p>
<p>Inside the department, Constellations wearing connecting goggles and diving inside the 'Recycling Center' were sitting in a row.</p>
<p>The 'Recycling Center' was a place that could not be entered without special network equipment. So there was no problem with the Constellations sitting there with their goggles upside down.</p>
<p>The problem was their condition.</p>
<p>[Kkaaaaaaaaa—!]</p>
<p>With a terrible scream, story of the Constellations wearing goggles began to drip out of their bodies.</p>
<p>[What the! Release the dive! Quickly!]</p>
<p>What could have happened?</p>
<p>The dive terminal provided by the Information Bureau was a Constellation device that ensured the safety of the Constellations when infiltrating the 'lower scenarios'.</p>
<p>As long as they were wearing this Constellation device, the Constellations would not be annihilated, but would lose their stories or suffer damage in the lower scenarios.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Brother of the Immortal' enters a sudden extinction process.]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Forgotten Monster Hunter' enters a sudden extinction process.]</p>
<p>The Constellations were dying. It couldn't have happened.</p>
<p>The place they were deployed was at most the twentieth main scenario. Even if they had encountered a monster above the level of a legend, there was no reason for them to be in danger of death.</p>
<p>[Disarm the dive!]</p>
<p>They had to find the cause. And to do that, the most urgent task was to revive the Constellations that were disappearing.</p>
<p>[Disarm the 'Recycling Center' entry process! Hurry up—]</p>
<p>[Stop, it won't be released!]</p>
<p>[What?]</p>
<p>[The entire control system is down!]</p>
<p>The Constellations began to disappear one by one.</p>
<p>The total number of Historical-grade Constellations deployed in this operation was forty. If they had lost them all, it would have been a serious blow to the reputation of the Director of the Information Bureau, not to mention disciplinary action from their superiors.</p>
<p>However, the situation did not end there.</p>
<p>[The condition of the general agents of the Information Bureau is also strange!]</p>
<p>Along with the secretary's shout, the Surveillance Constellations located in the general department began to complain of pain.</p>
<p>[The condition of the Constellations that were monitoring the 'Recycling Center'—]</p>
<p>The Constellations were complaining of pain, pouring out words from their noses and mouths.</p>
<p>Hermaphroditus asked, unable to hide her bewilderment.</p>
<p>[What on earth... what on earth is going on? Has the 'One-Eyed Father' appeared? Is someone interfering with the 'Fate' we read?]</p>
<p>Of course, that couldn't be the case.</p>
<p>Even if a Myth-grade Constellation from another nebula had intervened, it couldn't have encroached upon the entire 'Hermes System'.</p>
<p>[Data screen! Where is the data screen!]</p>
<p>The screen that the agents of the Information Bureau were monitoring belatedly came to mind.</p>
<p>In the screen, there was an incarnation covered in the blood of the Constellations.</p>
<p>Hermaphroditus felt goosebumps.</p>
<p>That 'being' is definitely beyond the screen.</p>
<p>They are in a place where they can never be seen. But for some reason, Hermaphroditus felt like her eyes met his.</p>
<p>At that moment, Hermaphroditus recalled a face she had seen briefly while reading top secret materials.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>The 'Oldest Dream' that dreamed of this entire universe.</p>
<p>「Abandoned God.」</p>
<p>The god who should have clearly disappeared was ordering them.</p>
<p>"Explode."</p>
<hr/>
<p>The Constellations in the night sky were exploding like firecrackers.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four.</p>
<p>It was a scene that could be considered a scene of massacre.</p>
<p>Teacher Yang, who was watching the scene—the 'Temon-Like Judge of Fire'—said.</p>
<p>[We can't leave it like that.]</p>
<p>She was witnessing the death of the Constellations through the screen in the principal's office.</p>
<p>However, what she was worried about was not the dying Constellations.</p>
<p>[He'll die again.]</p>
<p>The white grim reaper who was mercilessly slaughtering those great Constellations. A man covered in the blood of the Constellations while his white coat fluttered. It was the agent of the 'Demon King of Salvation' who kept on destroying while continuously bleeding from his nose and mouth.</p>
<p>[That's right. But there's no one who can stop him now.]</p>
<p>The Mass-Producer looked at the screen with calm eyes.</p>
<p>A man was walking, engulfed in wild anger and sadness. It was unclear what was tormenting him so much.</p>
<p>However, it was clear what he was trying to do.</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is going crazy!]</p>
<p>[The story 'The One Who Rewrites Fate' begins its storytelling!]</p>
<p>Common sense would tell you that the miracle the agent of the Demon King of Salvation was doing now was impossible.</p>
<p>In just the twentieth scenario, he was able to make a 'Historical-grade Constellation' explode with a single word? Not only was it impossible, but it was also an ability that even Myth-grade Constellations would not easily attempt.</p>
<p>And yet, the agent of a mere Constellation was violently wielding such an absurd power.</p>
<p>「This was possible because this stage was the 'Recycling Center'.」</p>
<p>All the Constellations that have now entered the 'Recycling Center' have lowered their 'level' to the limit.</p>
<p>In particular, all the Constellations that are bursting out now were beings that entered through the 'Hermes System' of &lt;Olympus&gt;.</p>
<p>The 'Hermes System' operates based on the 'Master of Skywalk's' story network. And Cheon Inho's [Incite] was a skill that spread at a destructive speed through the 'network'.</p>
<p>「"Explode"」</p>
<p>The sentence spread through the network like a virus, and gained momentous  power by weaving countless stories during the propagation process.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Demon King of Salvation (Acting Agent)' reveals his status!]</p>
<p>The ultimate [Incite] that combines Cheon Inho's [Incite] with Christina Page's [Daily Invoice] and [Hypnotic Incite], and even [Sentence Reinforcement].</p>
<p>「"Burst."」</p>
<p>All the Constellations of the 'Hermes System', which were lower in rank than the 'Demon King of Salvation', were unable to withstand the power of [Incite] and were entering a process of self-destruction.</p>
<p>[All the Constellations of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; can't take their eyes off of it!]</p>
<p>[All the Constellations of the 'Gourmet Association' gape their mouths!]</p>
<p>[Many Constellations are astonished by the power of 'Incite'!]</p>
<p>[The Constellations belonging to the Nebula &lt;Olympus&gt; can't hide their astonishment.]</p>
<p>Constellations bursting out from the distant universe as if a grand banquet was being held.</p>
<p>[Olympus will probably never forget that scene.]</p>
<p>The Mass-Producer and Uriel could not take their eyes off either.</p>
<p>[When this scenario ends, another great story will be born.]</p>
<p>Even though he knew that it was ultimately inviting Kim Dokja's downfall, and even though he knew that he was dying every time he uttered a word.</p>
<p>Just looking at the Constellations that were fleetingly falling at a single command, the Mass-Producer and Uriel had the same thought.</p>
<p>「I'll be able to see this story again.」</p>
<p>However, regardless of their wishes, the end of the scenario was approaching.</p>
<p>The maddened Demon King of Salvation's agent staggered along the forest path. He blew up the enemies who blocked his way, and continued his merciless destruction until he finally reached the deepest part of the forest.</p>
<p>The Mass-Producer muttered as if sighing.</p>
<p>[Now we'll know who the 'real Kim Dokja' is.]</p>
