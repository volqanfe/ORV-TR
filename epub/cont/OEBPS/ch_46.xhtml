<hr/>
<p>[You have entered the 'Snowfield'.]</p>
<p>In the colorless world, all blood looked the same.</p>
<p>No red blood, no blue blood. Everything was gray.</p>
<p>I felt sad.</p>
<p>In this wide world.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill '■■' resonates with your emotions.]</p>
<p>There's not a single piece of paper for extras.</p>
<fieldset>
<p># Words That Can't Be Said</p>
<p>「■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■.......」</p>
<p>* At your current skill level, you can write a total of 260 additional characters.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>[You can stay in the 'Snowfield' for a total of 3 minutes.]</p>
<p>I began to write. It wasn't a story I was writing for anyone.</p>
<p>There are stories like that. Stories that are neither artistic nor interesting, but you can't resist writing them.</p>
<p>[You have described something that cannot be evaluated.]</p>
<p>[You cannot assess the reproduction success rate of this story.]</p>
<p>[You can't measure the probability you've been granted.]</p>
<p>[Checking the reader's feedback.]</p>
<p>[There is no reader's feedback.]</p>
<p>There was no feedback.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>[rlaehrwk37 recognizes your story.]</p>
<p>Someone has definitely read this story.</p>
<p>[rlaehrwk61 recognizes your story.]</p>
<p>[rlaehrwk99 recognizes your story.]</p>
<p>[rlaehrwk73 recognizes your story.]</p>
<p>.......</p>
<p>[You've earned probability from a certain number of referrals.]</p>
<p>[Successfully recreating the scene.]</p>
<p>[Leaving the 'Snowfield'.]</p>
<p>I blinked slowly, and the colors of the world returned.</p>
<p>In front of my eyes, a ground rat bit a breathless person.</p>
<p>「Lee Hakhyun knew. Why the extras were never talked about.」</p>
<p>I know better than anyone.</p>
<p>It's the writer, not anyone else, who excludes the extras from the story.</p>
<p>「Because their stories are already written.」</p>
<p>An unnamed ground rat bit an unnamed man to death.</p>
<p>As I stabbed the nameless ground rats again, I thought to myself.</p>
<p>「These pages, which no one can read, are their story.」</p>
<p>What had been a gray, snowy world was now covered in red and blue blood.</p>
<p>Stories that are not told because they are everywhere.</p>
<p>Death in the middle of unwritten lines.</p>
<p>「There are no sentences for extras.」</p>
<p>It was a matter of course.</p>
<p>The moment you write a sentence for an extra, they become a protagonist.</p>
<p>When one person becomes the protagonist, the rest become extras.</p>
<p>"Help—"</p>
<p>"KKuaaak!"</p>
<p>I barely saved one person, and another died.</p>
<p>I never learned the names of the dead. Even though I was right next to them, I couldn't see how they died.</p>
<p>Dead people with their eyes open as if in mourning.</p>
<p>Damn it, even in this scene, I was a writer. An insensitive recorder, trying to write a sentence on the blank space created by their deaths.</p>
<p>「Nevertheless, someone has to make footprints in this snowfield.」</p>
<p>A ground rat nibbled at my thigh.</p>
<p>「Someone has to be the protagonist, after all.」</p>
<p>I swatted it away, and a second one bit my arm.</p>
<p>「That's what this snowfield is for.」</p>
<p>I slammed my arm down on its head. But when I killed one, two came, and when I shook them off, three came.</p>
<p>"N-no—"</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi! Stop! Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p>Looking back at the stairwell, I saw the faces of Kyung Sein, Dansoo ahjussi, and Ye Hyunwoo one after another.</p>
<p>Gong Pildu and Jung Heewon hadn't regained consciousness yet.</p>
<p>Lee Jihye was busy fending off the monsters coming up the stairwell.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi, what are you doing! Hurry up and come this way!"</p>
<p>There were still quite a few people who hadn't made it to the stairwell. The fort formations had all collapsed, and the people were cornered.</p>
<p>At this rate, Chungmuro Station would be wiped out.</p>
<p>I made a decision.</p>
<p>I don't know if this will work.</p>
<p>"Idea."</p>
<p>Still, I had to try.</p>
<p>"Let's go."</p>
<p>'Thoughts of Almost Everything' gurgled into the bracelet.</p>
<p>I commanded it.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.5' is activated.]</p>
<p>"Turn into the Ever-changing Stealth Suit."</p>
<p>Ever-changing Stealth Suit.</p>
<p>The disguise item 'RepresentativeKimDokja' was wearing.</p>
<p>At the time, I had fulfilled the requirement of 'being hit 10 times' to obtain the appearance of 'Ever-changing Stealth Suit' which allowed me to place this item in the 'mimicry list'.</p>
<p>[Putting on the 'Ever-changing Stealth Suit'!]</p>
<p>'Transform into a ground rat.'</p>
<p>A moment later, with a blinding flash of light, my appearance changed to that of a ground rat.</p>
<p>The ground rats that had been pouncing on me stopped in their tracks.</p>
<p>They sniffed and hovered around me.</p>
<p>Some of them bared their fangs at me, showing their intense hostility.</p>
<p>I suppose it's natural for them to be suspicious, since they saw me as a human just a moment ago.</p>
<p>I used [Incite] on them.</p>
<p>"I am a ground rat."</p>
<p>A few ground rats came up to me and sniffed, then one by one they scurried past me.</p>
<p>Luckily, the plan worked.</p>
<p>I ran backwards through the procession of ground rats and quickly made my way to the center of the platform.</p>
<p>I could see two giant centipedes roaring at the ceiling.</p>
<p>Now a bit.</p>
<p>Everywhere I looked, the ground rats left out wild cries.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>「...... ......」</p>
<p>I heard a strange voice.</p>
<p>I turned around, wondering where it was coming from.</p>
<p>[Your exclusive attribute is activated].</p>
<p>[You understand the language settings.]</p>
<p>[You are interpreting the language of the ground rats.]</p>
<p>「Go up」</p>
<p>The ground rat was speaking.</p>
<p>「Runrunrunrun」</p>
<p>「Stayclosetomommy」</p>
<p>「Justalittlebitjustalittlebit」</p>
<p>「Upupup」</p>
<p>A ground rat that was passing by me stopped to look at me.</p>
<p>「Notthatway」</p>
<p>It looked at me and added.</p>
<p>「Runthisway」</p>
<p>I asked it.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>「BecausethatstheorderBecausethatstheorder」</p>
<p>The order. By who?</p>
<p>The ground rat shuddered, looked back toward the tunnel, and started running past me again.</p>
<p>I couldn't hear the answer, but I knew why it was running.</p>
<p>Humans are not the only participants in scenarios.</p>
<p>Everything in this world belongs to the 'scenario'. This was true even for the ground rats in front of me.</p>
<p>「Mommy」</p>
<p>「Helphelphelp」</p>
<p>「Cantbreathecantbreathe」</p>
<p>I looked down at the floor. There was a pile of bullet-riddled ground rats corpses.</p>
<p>Dozens of times more than the dead humans.</p>
<p>「The extras, they don't even realize they're extras.」</p>
<p>A huge shadow was casted over me.</p>
<p>「You」</p>
<p>Since when? A giant centipede was bending over my head.</p>
<p>「Why did you come this way?」</p>
<p>I looked around without answering.</p>
<p>This was the center of the station.</p>
<p>People were almost at the top of the stairs. The important thing is to stall the time from now on until Gong Pildu unleashes the [Armed Zone] again.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.5' is activated!]</p>
<p>"Look this way!"</p>
<p>In response to my [Incite], a bunch of ground rats turned to look at me.</p>
<p>「Whatwhatwhatwhat」</p>
<p>「Wherewherewherewhere」</p>
<p>It wasn't enough.</p>
<p>I shouted again.</p>
<p>"This way!"</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.5' is being used to the limit!]</p>
<p>[The level of the exclusive skill 'Incite' has increased!]</p>
<p>Poosyuk, Blood trickled from my nose with the sound.</p>
<p>This time, more of them looked back at me. Some of the ground rats that ran straight ahead, others that jumped up to the stairwell and attacked people.</p>
<p>They were all looking in my direction.</p>
<p>「Whatwhat」</p>
<p>「Whowhowho」</p>
<p>「Whywhywhywhywhy」</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered the 'outer gods' from Omniscient Reader. They were extras who died as 'Nameless Ones' in the worldview of the 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p>I was not a Kim Dokja, so I did not have the power to save them.</p>
<p>Instead, I was forced to kill them all to end the scenario.</p>
<p>'Idea.'</p>
<p>I invoked it, and in my mind's eye, I could see the forms I had collected so far.</p>
<p>Magic Power Recovery Bracelet.</p>
<p>Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick.</p>
<p>Ever-changing Stealth Suit.</p>
<p>Magic Power Stove.</p>
<p>And.......</p>
<p>I didn't want to use this items until the end. Because, in return, the platform would be a dead zone for a while.</p>
<p>But now I had no other choice.</p>
<p>"Turn into a 'Poison Bomb'."</p>
<p>Poison Bomb. It was an item they left behind when we fought the Misreading Association.</p>
<p>A biochemical weapon made from the anal sac of a poisonous rhinoceros.</p>
<p>I picked up one of the used bombs at the time and put it on the possible mimicry list.</p>
<p>[The consumed item is restored by the effect of 'Thoughts of Almost Everything'.]</p>
<p>[The rare occasion of shape evolution has occurred!]</p>
<p>[The form of the item has evolved to a higher level!]</p>
<p>['Thoughts of Almost Everything' has turned into 'High-Level Poison Bomb'.]</p>
<p>A moment later, a faintly glowing bomb appeared in front of me.</p>
<p>[This item is a consumable item.]</p>
<p>[When the item is used, you won't be able to use the form again.]</p>
<p>[The effect of the 'Ever-changing Stealth Suit' will be lifted.]</p>
<p>As I reverted to my normal form, the ground rats growled and showed their hostility.</p>
<p>But none of them pounced on me. Even the giant centipede kept a wary distance and glared at my hand for a reason.</p>
<p>They know.</p>
<p>If I detonate this bomb now, every monster in the station will be wiped out.</p>
<p>「Ohnomommyimscared」</p>
<p>「Hidebehindmom」</p>
<p>I stared at them for a moment.</p>
<p>「Whatsgoingon」</p>
<p>「Humanhumanhuman」</p>
<p>「IdontwanttodieIdontwanttodie」</p>
<p>I slowly opened my mouth.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.5' is activated.]</p>
<p>"You don't have to die like this."</p>
<p>I looked back at the ground rats, the giant centipedes, and the grolls.</p>
<p>"Don't hurt any more people and go back. Then I won't kill you either."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' admires your boldness.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' opens its mouth at your suggestion.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' marvels at your integrity.]</p>
<p>I know the odds are slim.</p>
<p>But theoretically, the monsters and humans could resolve the scenario without harming each other.</p>
<p>[There are 7 hours and 12 minutes remaining until the end of the Emergency Defense Battle.]</p>
<p>I continued.</p>
<p>"Emergency Defense Battle is a scenario with a time limit. It will end at some point, even if they don't hurt each other."</p>
<p>I could feel the ground rats' agitation.</p>
<p>「A story where no one is the protagonist, maybe.」</p>
<p>The extras had died enough. Monsters and humans alike knew.</p>
<p>[The ground rats are confused by your 'Incite'.]</p>
<p>Monsters, too, are but incarnations. They also fear death.</p>
<p>They have families, they have friends.</p>
<p>They have lives.</p>
<p>Tsuchuchuchuchut!</p>
<p>It was then that sparks exploded in thin air.</p>
<p>[Some dokkaebis find your attempts to be a threat to the scenario.]</p>
<p>[Many constellations are eager to see the scenario unfold quickly!]</p>
<p>[The probability of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; is moving.]</p>
<p>[Your 'Incite' has been lifted.]</p>
<p>[Emergency Defensive Battle will resume.]</p>
<p>[A few constellations laugh at your reckless behavior.]</p>
<p>Looking at the message, I thought.</p>
<p>「After all, isn't this world one giant instigator?」</p>
<p>One of the ground rats looked at me and said.</p>
<p>「Thereisnosuchstory」</p>
<p>With those words, a mischief of ground rats pounced on me.</p>
<p>I replied.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>There was a loud explosion. A blizzard of poisonous gas, accompanied by an unpleasant odor, swept across the platform.</p>
<p>I heard the screams of the monsters. The giant centipedes and ground rats dying, their bodies spewing black blood.</p>
<p>I could see the monsters from the tunnel falling to the ground as well. As I watched them die, I thought to myself.</p>
<p>「If only the monsters hadn't died here, this story would have been interesting.」</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' cheers for the mass murder.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' says that monsters are best when they're dead.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' admires your idea.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Dragon Lying Down' appreciates your strategy.]</p>
<p>.......</p>
<p>I stumbled, barely able to catch my breath. I felt like I was going to collapse at any moment, but it wasn't time yet.</p>
<p>I swallowed the Poisonous Rhinoceros' Horn Powder little by little and turned around to start walking.</p>
<p>One step, two steps.</p>
<p>I walked and walked and walked through a landscape swallowed up by the dense fog, stabbing each approaching ground rat thoroughly, one by one.</p>
<p>I swallowed the nausea that rose. A few times I stumbled over dead bodies, and then got back up.</p>
<p>I heard a small cry in my ear. It was a dying ground rat. I was about to strike it down with my thorn.</p>
<p>Kking.</p>
<p>I realized that the ground rat was already dead. Instead, I found a tiny creature squirming in its arms.</p>
<p>It was a ground rat pup.</p>
<p>I stared down at it in disbelief.</p>
<p>「After all, every story has a protagonist.」</p>
<p>As if it wanted to live, the pup struggled to breath and exhale with difficulty.</p>
<p>I could see the tip of its nose turning black from exposure to the gas.</p>
<p>I bent down and scooped it up in my arms. I poured a little of the remaining Poisonous Rhinoceros' Horn Powder into its mouth.</p>
<p>Its groans gradually ceased.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' is watching your story.]</p>
<p>I walked across the platform with the pup in my arms. It was hard to see through the fog.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Lotus Blooming Under the Moonlight' is watching your story.]</p>
<p>I walked and walked and walked, relying on the faint voices of the stars.</p>
<p>Little by little, my consciousness faded.</p>
<p>I could hear voices in the distance.</p>
<p>They were the voices of those looking for me.</p>
<p>The tip of my foot caught on something hard. It was the stairs. I had to go up.</p>
<p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is watching your story.]</p>
<p>I glanced back absentmindedly.</p>
<p>The bodies of so many monsters and humans, now buried in the thick fog, were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>I took a step up the stairs, and a single footprint imprinted itself.</p>
<p>[You have achieved an impossible feat.]</p>
<p>It was a pitch black footprint.</p>
<p>[Your first 'story' is germinating.]</p>
<p>I went up the stairs.</p>
