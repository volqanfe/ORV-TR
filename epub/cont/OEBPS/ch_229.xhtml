<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">781 Episode 36 Real Kim Dokja (2)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>With a special sound, the high-level demon fell.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo retrieved the 'Kim Dokja fragment' that the high-level demon had.</p>
<p>['Kim Dokja fragment' retrieved successfully.]</p>
<p>The energy of the story flowing in with the message.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo checked his face reflected in the puddle. The white and pale face that he had once seen on the cover of 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』. It looked a bit younger than what he had seen then. Perhaps it was because his physical age was that of a boy.</p>
<p>「I wonder if I have become a little more Kim Dokja now.」</p>
<p>How many more 'Kim Dokja fragments' does he have to collect to become Kim Dokja?</p>
<p>Can he become Kim Dokja?</p>
<p>「"If you are possessed, you must hide behind me. You hate being hurt."」</p>
<p>A memory suddenly lingered in his ears.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo thought of the owner of the voice.</p>
<p>'Noh Jiyoon.'</p>
<p>The daughter of Lee Dansu ahjussi. The girl who visited 'Kim Dokja Banquet' with him.</p>
<p>「Jiyoon is dead.」</p>
<p>No one told him that. However, he found out naturally while collecting the 'Kim Dokja fragments'.</p>
<p>「Everyone, get out of here! Quickly!」</p>
<p>There was a reader who fell at the same station as Jiyoon. Jiyoon fought the monsters to save the reader and the people, and died.</p>
<p>It wasn't that surprising in this world.</p>
<p>The reader Jiyoon saved that day also died in the end. Torn to pieces by a high-level demon.</p>
<p>What was the meaning of Jiyoon's sacrifice?</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo couldn't quite understand it.</p>
<p>「Just like how he couldn’t understand Kim Dokja, who risked his life for his group, while reading 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' over fifty times.」</p>
<p>"You're right. I like being safe."</p>
<p>Replying to his old friend's voice, Ye Hyunwoo walked around. There was no road, but he walked where he thought it was a road.</p>
<p>He also hummed a song that his friend Jiyoon liked. As he hummed the song, memories that were still vivid enough to be called memories came back to him one after another.</p>
<p>[The story 'Panda and Friends' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>The story of persuading Gong Pildu to survive in Chungmuro.</p>
<p>The story of developing the 'Invincible Castle Tech Tree'.</p>
<p>The story of almost fighting Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>The story of 'capturing the flag' with the readers.</p>
<p>The story of meeting Cheon Inho and his group.</p>
<p>"But Jiyoon. You liked being safe, too."</p>
<p>Disaster scenarios and Peace Land, the Washington Dome and the 'Recycling Center'.</p>
<p>Hiding together in a brick house.</p>
<p>Eating soup made by the crane owner.</p>
<p>Fixing a swallow's leg or taking care of a goose in labor.</p>
<p>Watching the group from a corner while eating bamboo.</p>
<p>Counting each of those things, Ye Hyunwoo felt that all of those things were like a novel.</p>
<p>Then what role was he assigned in that novel?</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo's steps stopped. The forest ended and a small open space appeared.</p>
<p>There was a demon.</p>
<p>A man wearing a white coat and spreading his black wings.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo swallowed as he looked at the red horns sprouting from his head.</p>
<p>[The demon '73rd Demon King' is staring at you.]</p>
<p>The '73rd Demon King' slowly turned his back and looked at him.</p>
<p>「Demon King of Salvation.」</p>
<p>He had expected it since he heard that the name of the demon was '73rd Demon King'.</p>
<p>That 'Demon King of Salvation' was here. The protagonist they were looking for had appeared as their opponent.</p>
<p>But the moment their eyes met, Ye Hyunwoo felt strange.</p>
<p>「That's the 'Demon King of Salvation'?」</p>
<p>He definitely felt the powerful energy of the 'Kim Dokja Fragments' from him.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>'Come to your senses.'</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo shook his head several times and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>'I have to kill him.'</p>
<p>Since he was marked as the boss of this stage, the 'Demon King of Salvation' must have powers of a different dimension.</p>
<p>He must not let his party face the 'Demon King of Salvation'. If he did, there would definitely be casualties. In order to prevent that, he came here before anyone else.</p>
<p>The moment he took a deep breath and stepped into the empty space, shouts were heard from all directions. The forest in the area shook and a group of incarnations appeared.</p>
<p>[Hit him!]</p>
<p>The incarnations who had drawn their weapons were running towards the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo immediately recognized who they were. The Constellations of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt;. They were the ones who had participated in the scenario with them until recently.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Monkey That Fell From A Tree' roars!]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Ox of the Beginning' bares its teeth!]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Red Divine Army' roars!]</p>
<p>At first, it seemed like the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; were joining hands to hunt the demon.</p>
<p>But the wave pattern felt strange. The &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; he knew did not have that level of power.</p>
<p>'It's not the Twelve Zodiac Signs'.</p>
<p>A cold sensation passed through his heart belatedly.</p>
<p>'Someone is using the modifiers of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt;'.</p>
<p>As if they knew the demon's weakness, the Constellations equipped with divine attribute weapons swung their weapons in precise trajectories. Push shot!</p>
<p>The demon tribe was mercilessly slaughtered by an attack that had the rank of a Constellation.</p>
<p>Looking at the staggering demon, Ye Hyunwoo's head went through complicated calculations.</p>
<p>It might have been a good thing.</p>
<p>The 'Demon King of Salvation' is a difficult opponent to face alone. If they wait for an opportunity here and join forces with the Constellations, the scenario will be much easier.</p>
<p>'Let's get started.'</p>
<p>From the start of the scenarios until now, Ye Hyunwoo has steadily progressed through the 'Invincible Castle Tech Tree'.</p>
<p>The 'Invincible Castle Tech Tree' he designed has a total of 10 stages.</p>
<p>And Ye Hyunwoo has just reached the activation condition for stage 8 of the tech tree.</p>
<p>[Activate exclusive skill 'Magic Charge Lv. 10'.]</p>
<p>The key to this build-up is to apply his exclusive skill, [Magic Charge] — to supply unlimited magical power to Gong Pildu, who has the strongest defense.</p>
<p>「But there is no Gong Pildu here now.」</p>
<p>Several Constellations that felt the magical wave turned to Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p>[That guy—]</p>
<p>[Don’t worry. He is an incarnation that can’t do anything alone.]</p>
<p>Is his weakness already known to the Constellations?</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>They were certainly right. He is an incarnation that can’t do anything alone.</p>
<p>'But isn’t that the same for everyone?'</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo slowly took a deep breath and gathered his magical power. It was finally time for the 'Kim Dokja Fragments' he had collected to exert their power.</p>
<p>[The power of the new 'Kim Dokja Fragments' is activated.]</p>
<p>[Some of the skills of 'The Oldest Dream' are restored.]</p>
<p>The 'Invincible Castle Tech Tree' he had envisioned required 'Gong Pildu' up to stage 7.</p>
<p>However, it was different from stage 8.</p>
<p>[Activate exclusive skill 'Bookmark Lv.5'!]</p>
<p>[The composition of this skill is incomplete.]</p>
<p>[The characters that can be listed in the bookmark list are limited.]</p>
<p>「Bookmark」</p>
<p>A skill that is exclusive to Kim Dokja and can borrow the power of a 'character'.</p>
<p>It is currently extremely incomplete, so only one 'character' can be registered, but that was enough.</p>
<p>In the first place, he only needed one character.</p>
<p>"I will activate bookmark 1, 'Armed Fortress Master Gong Pildu'."</p>
<p>[Bookmark 1 has been activated.]</p>
<p>[The activation time is determined in proportion to the level of the bookmark skill.]</p>
<p>[Your understanding of the character is very high.]</p>
<p>[The activation time of the bookmark skill is partially adjusted according to your exclusive characteristics.]</p>
<p>[Activation time: 20 minutes]</p>
<p>The character that had been protecting him was now inside him.</p>
<p>[Activate exclusive skill 'Private Land Lv.10'!]</p>
<p>Gong Pildu's private land occupied the area in an instant.</p>
<p>However, this alone was not enough to activate the 'Armed Fortress'. This was because Gong Pildu's 'Armed Fortress' was not an exclusive skill, but a 'stigma'.</p>
<p>[Bookmark cannot borrow the 'stigma' of the person in question.]</p>
<p>Of course, Ye Hyunwoo had a countermeasure for that.</p>
<p>"I will fulfill the contract with the Defense Master."</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Defense Master' activates the contract.]</p>
<p>A contract made with the 'Defense Master' in preparation for an emergency.</p>
<p>The contract was simple.</p>
<p>In exchange for granting the Defense Master's request, he would receive one of Gong Pildu's 'Stigmata' at a 'desired moment'.</p>
<p>[You have acquired the temporary use of 'Armed Fortress'.]</p>
<p>[The corresponding stigma will be converted to an 'Exclusive Skill' for the corresponding scenario.]</p>
<p>[Exclusive Skill 'Armed Fortress Lv. 8' has been activated!]</p>
<p>The ground beneath his feet rose and Ye Hyunwoo's body rose into the air.</p>
<p>The outer wall of the 'Armed Fortress' that would protect him from any attack was growing.</p>
<p>[What, what is this—]</p>
<p>A small castle that grew more than twenty meters in an instant.</p>
<p>It looked rather crude compared to the 'Armed Fortress' of Tech Tree Stage 10 that he was aiming for, but this was enough for now.</p>
<p>[The 'Moving Fortress' is activated.]</p>
<p>The fortress began to move along with the wheels that grew under the fortress.</p>
<p>[The 'Turret' of the Armed Fortress is activated.]</p>
<p>As the magnificent magic turrets aimed forward at once, the Constellations that felt a sense of crisis shouted.</p>
<p>[Didn't you say that guy can't do anything alone?]</p>
<p>[Damn it, finish him off quickly! If that guy steals the effective hit—]</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo sat on the castle's control tower while listening to the Constellations' screams.</p>
<p>[Activate the power of the item 'Shin Gijeon'.]</p>
<p>[The 'Turret's' arc destructive power increases!]</p>
<p>[The 'Turret's' shells have a tracking function added.]</p>
<p>The castle's radar activated and the dusty 'Demon King of Salvation' appeared in the field of view.</p>
<p>[Set the target of the strike.]</p>
<p>The 'Demon King of Salvation' had already suffered massive damage to its incarnation body.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo, who had finally made up his mind, pressed the fire button.</p>
<p>The 64 turrets opened fire, and a loud noise rang out as if they were sweeping away the forest. The dust rose pitch black.</p>
<p>However, the scream heard within was not that of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p>[Kuaaaaaaaah!]</p>
<p>The incarnations of the Constellations burst into pieces in the dust.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Monkey That Fell From The Tree' takes a huge blow and exits the scenario.]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Rabbit Without A Liver' takes a huge blow and exits the scenario.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Even some of the Constellations could not withstand the blow and exited the scenario.</p>
<p>Even so, Ye Hyunwoo did not stop.</p>
<p>[You, why—]</p>
<p>The indignant Constellations aimed their weapons at him.</p>
<p>Looking at the Constellations running towards him, Ye Hyunwoo thought.</p>
<p>「Why did I do that?」</p>
<p>It was an unwise choice. Naturally, joining forces with those Constellations to end the demon and share the story would have been the safe choice.</p>
<p>However, the moment he saw the 'Demon King of Salvation' caught on the radar, Ye Hyunwoo could not make a safe choice.</p>
<p>「It definitely wasn't the Demon King of Salvation that he imagined.」</p>
<p>The face of the 'Demon King of Salvation' who had become a demon was as pale as a corpse.</p>
<p>A body like rags made of flesh. Eyes that had lost their light and skin that felt lifeless.</p>
<p>In the end, this scenario had to end by hunting him.</p>
<p>That's the only way to save the party.</p>
<p>He came here before anyone else for that goal.</p>
<p>Even so, the moment he saw Kim Dokja's face, Ye Hyunwoo felt faintly dizzy.</p>
<p>「I don't know if the author will see it. But I'll try it anyway. There's a spell I sometimes recite when I'm having a hard time.」</p>
<p>The enraged Constellations abandoned the demon and began to run toward the castle.</p>
<p>「I am Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo knew it too. He is not Kim Dokja. He knew better than anyone that he was not Kim Dokja, so he recited that spell.</p>
<p>「But according to my friend, I resemble an octopus more than a squid.」</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo pressed the fire button again and again.</p>
<p>Piles of dirt scattered everywhere. The Constellations screamed in frustration amidst the broken pieces of wood.</p>
<p>[Kwaaaaah! Damn it!]</p>
<p>[Hold on! Wait until the bastard’s magic runs out! How long can he keep up this barrage—]</p>
<p>With the effect of [Magic Charge], magic power filled Ye Hyunwoo’s entire body once again.</p>
<p>The core of the Invincible Castle’s tech tree—the「Infinite Uroboros」system—was manifested.</p>
<p>[Eww!]</p>
<p>The Constellations that had been holding on firmly began to fall one by one.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo’s inner self also gradually grew more certain.</p>
<p>They were at most the incarnation bodies of 'Historical-grade Constellations'. Even if the synchronization rate was increased in this 'Recycling Center' with limited rank, they would not be able to withstand the fortress' concentrated bombardment.</p>
<p>[Warning! The durability of the 'Armed Fortress' is decreasing!]</p>
<p>A thud was heard, along with the sound of something collapsing.</p>
<p>Startled, Ye Hyunwoo checked the radar. However, nothing was detected. Someone was attacking the fortress at a speed that could not be detected by the detection system.</p>
<p>Kugugugu.</p>
<p>The current 'Armed Fortress' was now only a level 5 fortress.</p>
<p>As powerful strikes continued, the outer wall of the fortress collapsed and cracks began to form on the inner wall.</p>
<p>The moment Ye Hyunwoo, who had lost some energy, recharged his magic power once again and activated the turret, something appeared, breaking through the control tower's defense wall.</p>
<p>[I didn't know that 'Armed Fortress' would be used like this. It's quite something.]</p>
<p>Three incarnations appeared. They were all guys he had never seen before.</p>
<p>The incarnation body of the Constellation at the forefront approached Ye Hyunwoo like a ghost and grabbed him by the neck.</p>
<p>[Why did you interfere with us?]</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo laughed, hanging in the air.</p>
<p>Even now, Ye Hyunwoo does not understand Kim Dokja, who sacrificed himself for the group.</p>
<p>However, even though he did not understand him, Ye Hyunwoo liked him.</p>
<p>The Constellation, who was quietly looking at Ye Hyunwoo hanging in the air, spoke.</p>
<p>[What you did just now wasn't courage, it was just foolishness.]</p>
<p>The moment he heard that voice, Ye Hyunwoo felt goosebumps running down his spine.</p>
<p>He realized something new.</p>
<p>The 'Invincible Castle Tech Tree Stage 8' was designed to withstand attacks from 'Historical-grade Constellations' inside the 'Recycling Center'.</p>
<p>But if they had broken through this wall and entered, it was clear what kind of enemy they were.</p>
<p>'Narrative-grade Constellation'.</p>
<p>The ominous sparks that surged through the air proved it.</p>
<p>He couldn't understand it. How did a narrative-grade Constellation intervene in the scenario of this 'Recycling Center'?</p>
<p>[The worldview is unstable due to the aftermath of excessive probability.]</p>
<p>[Many Constellations are watching the 'Recycling Center'.]</p>
<p>He could feel the gaze of the stars watching this place from the vast distance of space.</p>
<p>How many Constellations are watching this place?</p>
<p>[The worldview rules of the 'Recycling Center' are weakened.]</p>
<p>[The probability of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; starts to move!]</p>
<p>[An unidentified nebula interferes with the probability of the 'Recycling Center'.]</p>
<p>Olympus? Asgard? Vedas?</p>
<p>Or a small nebula that was hidden?</p>
<p>The moment he saw the aftershock of probability that brightly colored the empty space, Ye Hyunwoo intuitively felt that this scenario had completely left his hands.</p>
<p>[You also have a fragment of the oldest dream.]</p>
<p>"Bam-"</p>
<p>[This is really strange. Why do all the incarnations with this fragment invite death…]</p>
<p>Feeling a hand tightly squeezing his neck, Ye Hyunwoo intuitively sensed his end.</p>
<p>「"Kim Dokja, I will become him."」</p>
<p>Considering his boastful words, he felt that it was a vain end. At the same time, he also thought that this was a very fitting end for him. Perhaps, ever since he first saw Cheon Inho in Chungmuro, he had a feeling this day would come.</p>
<p>He couldn’t become Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>There was someone in this world who was much more suited to Kim Dokja’s place.</p>
<p>His role was to play the role of an extra in the lines that no one would remember.</p>
<p>However, if there was one last regret, it was this.</p>
<p>「I really wanted to say thank you. I’ll come back to see you again in a few days.」</p>
<p>That he couldn’t keep the promise he left in that comment.</p>
<p>As the powerful magic flowed through the Constellation’s hand, his consciousness began to fade.</p>
<p>If he died like this and became a fragment of Kim Dokja, would he be able to meet Jiyoon again? Would he be able to laugh and talk about this story when they met again?</p>
<p>Look, if you really possess someone in 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint', you'll die right away. Saying that—</p>
<p>Would he be able to not regret reading this story?</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo waited for death with such thoughts.</p>
<p>However, no matter how much time passed, his consciousness did not disappear. He felt his body floating in the air, and someone was holding him and putting him down on the floor.</p>
<p>He slowly opened his eyes and raised his head, and saw someone's back.</p>
<p>[The &lt;Star Stream&gt; intervenes in the probability aftermath of the area.]</p>
<p>[The probability scale moves.]</p>
<p>Is it Kim Dokja?</p>
<p>But when he looked again, he was wearing a black cloak.</p>
<p>So is it Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
<p>No. He was smaller than Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo noticed the words written on his back.</p>
<p>『OLD SCHOOL』.</p>
<p>Old School.</p>
<p>The boy wearing the cloak looked back at him. The moment he met those eyes that felt strangely stubborn, Ye Hyunwoo thought he knew who he was.</p>
<p>That's because he had read this story fifty times.</p>
<p>"You... look like my Dokja-hyung."</p>
<p>A being who could move the 'probability scale' against those scary Constellations.</p>
<p>"Thank you for saving my hyung."</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; came to the 'Recycling Center'.</p>
