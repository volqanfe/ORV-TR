<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">672 Episode 21 Kim Dokja (8)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>With the explosion, thick dust rose from the ground.</p>
<p>"Han Sooyoung!"</p>
<p>I ran to the center of Gwanghwamun where Han Sooyoung fell. No matter how many times I shouted, there was no answer from Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p>Coo coo coo coo.</p>
<p>The 'Absolute Throne' at the center of Gwanghwamun was rising into the air.</p>
<p>【Ooooooooooooo.】</p>
<p>A faint cry was heard from far away.</p>
<p>It was undoubtedly a deity from another world.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the sound was too far away so I didn't vomit blood or faint, but the seriousness of the situation was clear.</p>
<p>「This is something that did not happen in the previous 'Absolute Throne'’s scenario.」</p>
<p>The outer gods’ intervened.</p>
<p>Did Han Sooyoung fight something like that?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Hasn't she been trying to destroy this world?</p>
<p>"Han Sooyoung!"</p>
<p>I shouted once again, but Han Sooyoung was still nowhere to be seen. When the dust cleared, I saw the figure of Yoo Joonghyuk in the distance.</p>
<p>The guy was in a limp state, as if he had fainted.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk!"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's whole body was connected to a red thread extending from the 'Absolute Throne'.</p>
<p>The soaring Absolute Throne and the fallen Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>Very slowly, the distance between Yoo Joonghyuk and the throne was narrowing.</p>
<p>[The 'Throne Succession Ceremony' begins.]</p>
<p>The series of constellations continued.</p>
<p>Founder of the Absolute Throne. It was the will of that outer god.</p>
<p>"Hey, look at that!"</p>
<p>"It’s Yoo Joonghyuk!"</p>
<p>The surrounding incarnations, who discovered the sight belatedly, shouted loudly.</p>
<p>["Wow, things are getting fun. Then, we will come to the finale of this scenario."]</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the dokkaebi Paul appeared and activated a sub-scenario.</p>
<p>[A new sub-scenario has arrived.]</p>
<fieldset>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">&lt;Sub Scenario - Stealing the Throne&gt;</h3>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: A</p>
<p>Clear Condition: A new king will soon be born on the Korean Peninsula. Subdue Yoo Joonghyuk, the incarnation who is trying to sit on the throne, and usurp the 'absolute throne'.</p>
<p>Time limit: 30 minutes</p>
<p>Reward: 7,000 coins</p>
<p>Failure: —</p>
</fieldset>
<p>[Now, everyone. This is your last chance. Will you witness the king's coronation, or will you become the usurper of the throne?]</p>
<p>The intermediate dokkaebi burst into laughter as if enjoying this whole situation.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' diligently wipes his head.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' sighs and looks at the throne.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Founder of Hangul' is silent with a sad face.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' stares at the god of the other world.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' mocks that no one has courage!]</p>
<p>Although the constellations were afraid of the scenery, they did not take their eyes off it.</p>
<p>Even though the scenario was presented, none of the incarnations moved easily.</p>
<p>It was natural.</p>
<p>The person who inherits the throne now is the supreme incarnation, Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>There was no one who could challenge him, who single-handedly overthrew all kings.</p>
<p>Only one person.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk!"</p>
<p>Except me.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk! Get some sleep! If you sit there, it’s all over!"</p>
<p>I headed toward the throne, defeated the crowd, and approached the throne.</p>
<p>It must be stopped. It can be prevented. It is not too late.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi."</p>
<p>What held me back was that.</p>
<p>"That’s it."</p>
<p>A slender girl holding a long sword.</p>
<p>"Lee Jihye."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's royal guard was blocking the path leading to the throne.</p>
<p>"Now, if you cross this line, you’ll die, you know?"</p>
<p>Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon.</p>
<p>In addition, there were groups of people who followed the king.</p>
<p>"The king! Supreme King!"</p>
<p>"He is the new king of the Korean Peninsula!"</p>
<p>A woman with her white hair disheveled was also seen in the center of the group.</p>
<p>Incarnation Lee Seolhwa.</p>
<p>I realized it again.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st round has already gathered so many colleagues.</p>
<p>This guy didn't rest for a single moment, and was steadily taking steps toward the end of this world.</p>
<p>"I said you couldn’t go."</p>
<p>As soon as I took a decisive step, Lee Jihye pulled out her sword. It wasn't just a threat. If I go one step further now, I will definitely get cut.</p>
<p>Lightning struck from the sky, revealing the appearance of Yoo Joonghyuk, who was much closer to the throne.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung probably fought to stop it on her own.</p>
<p>The last time I met Han Sooyoung, I spoke smugly to her.</p>
<p>I am also the author of this story.</p>
<p>I'll try to convince you.</p>
<p>I will complete the story you wrote.</p>
<p>So what was the story I wrote?</p>
<p>I looked around Gwanghwamun.</p>
<p>Everything was in ruins.</p>
<p>Dying incarnations wriggled on the floor. The stars in the sky twinkled as if they were mocking me.</p>
<p>I thought I could do well.</p>
<p>I believed I knew the whole story too.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World' activates intermittently.]</p>
<p>Sentences of 'Ways of Survival' heard rarely.</p>
<p>Perhaps this skill is a memory Han Sooyoung gave me.</p>
<p>I smiled bitterly out of frustration.</p>
<p>If I didn't have this skill, I would have died early.</p>
<p>As I slowly took another step forward, Lee Jihye’s sword, which had been pulled out at the same time, reached me.</p>
<p>"If you move any further, I’ll have no choice but to cut you down."</p>
<p>While Yoo Joonghyuk was building his story, where and what was I doing?</p>
<p>「Obviously, there were a lot of stories I wanted to tell.」</p>
<p>I wanted to talk about characters who didn't receive attention in the main story. The lives of extras. I wanted to write a story for those who were forgotten in Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint and could not leave a single line of sentences.</p>
<p>I wanted to save Yoo Joonghyuk from the 41st round.</p>
<p>「Was any of them correct?」</p>
<p>For the first time, I realized my lack of talent as a writer.</p>
<p>"I am."</p>
<p>「I couldn't change this story.」</p>
<p>I took one more step, looking straight at Lee Jihye’s sword.</p>
<p>「If this is my karma for ruining the story.」</p>
<p>Lee Jihye's eyes, having decided on something, were colored with a harsh light. The moment when the girl's sword rushed towards me with the sound of cutting the wind.</p>
<p>"Jihye-ssi."</p>
<p>Someone grabbed Lee Jihye's blade.</p>
<p>"Please let Inho-ssi pass."</p>
<p>She was a woman shorter than me.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi has work to do."</p>
<p>The moment I heard her voice, a small warmth lingered deep in my heart.</p>
<p>[Fable 'Recorder of things that will disappear' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>Warmth soon became a sentence.</p>
<p>「The reader who was more scared than anyone else was there.」</p>
<p>Kyung Sein. The second reader I met. Among the characters, the person who likes Jung Heewon the most. He is someone who grew up because he wanted to become strong like Lee Hyunsung.</p>
<p>He must have suffered so much during this time that his body was full of wounds.</p>
<p>"Sein-ssi."</p>
<p>With a trembling body, Kyung Sein looked back at me.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi."</p>
<p>No matter how strong Kyung Sein became, his opponent was the protagonist of this story.</p>
<p>There is no match for him physically.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Kyung Sein did not back down.</p>
<p>"I don’t want to see this world destroyed."</p>
<p>Lee Jihye's expression hardened towards me, who listened to those words blankly.</p>
<p>"Are you going to fight us now?"</p>
<p>Her cold magic boiled over in her swordplay. This sword of wisdom, imbued with a deep blue sword, moved.</p>
<p>"Do you know how strong I am?"</p>
<p>If you get hit by something like that, no matter how powerful you are, you cannot avoid fatal injuries.</p>
<p>The moment Kyung Sein, embarrassed, hugged me and bent down, someone struck Lee Jihye's sword and derailed its trajectory. Someone kicked Lee Jihye’s blade.</p>
<p>"What-"</p>
<p>Lee Jihye stepped away while holding her wrist. Kim Namwoon, who was watching the scene, smiled with a happy attitude.</p>
<p>"Oh, what? This is getting fun?"</p>
<p>「There was a reader there who had read more novels than anyone else.」</p>
<p>Literature Girl 64.</p>
<p>Ja Yerin activated [combat action mode] and struck down Lee Jihye's sword.</p>
<p>"Yerin. What is the time limit?"</p>
<p>"3 minutes."</p>
<p>"We have to finish it within that time."</p>
<p>"That’s enough."</p>
<p>「There was a reader there who wanted to be Yoo Joonghyuk more than anyone else.」</p>
<p>Killer King Ja Sungwoo stretched out his hand to me who was sitting on the floor and said.</p>
<p>"Wake up, Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>Even during this time, I stood up while holding his hand, who did not lose sight of the concept.</p>
<p>Lee Jihye growled.</p>
<p>"Are you serious? Do you all want to die?"</p>
<p>"No one wants to die."</p>
<p>「There was a reader there who wanted to see the ending of this world without sacrificing anyone.」</p>
<p>Lee Dansu, who was carrying Shin Yoosoung, put his hand on my shoulder and said,</p>
<p>"Everyone gathered here so that no one would die."</p>
<p>What was so funny about those words? Kim Namwoon, the delusional demon, burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"Hahaha! That’s fun! It’s something you often see in novels."</p>
<p>For a moment, the delusional demon’s sword made a sharp sound and looked at us. Magical power overflowed throughout his body.</p>
<p>"Tell me some great lines like that too, huh?"</p>
<p>As the delusional demon approached in an instant and stretched out his fist, Yerin's body floated in the air.</p>
<p>Kim Namwoon laughed after blocking the arrow fired by the enraged Killer King with his forearm.</p>
<p>"That toy looks fun."</p>
<p>Black Flame stretched out from Kim Namwoon's hand and burned Killer King's bowgun. What saved the siblings, who were suddenly in danger, was a bullet flying from somewhere.</p>
<p>"Second apostle! Get down!"</p>
<p>「There was also a reader there who was more rational than anyone else, but was actually more passionate than anyone else.」</p>
<p>The smoke from the cannonballs covered the area along with the sound of doo-doo-doo-doo.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo ran through the dust and supported his companions. Gong Pildu covered behind him. I also saw Max the dog barking next to me.</p>
<p>"Pierce it! You must never give up the throne!"</p>
<p>With Ye Hyeonwoo’s command, the troops of Chungmuro ran shouting.</p>
<p>But the opponents were Lee Jihye and Kim Namwoon.</p>
<p>"Let's go!"</p>
<p>"Kaaaaaaak!"</p>
<p>People who lost limbs in a single slash screamed. Ja Yerin and Killer King. Lee Dansu and Kyung Sein also joined.</p>
<p>However, they have already overcome the scenario and have exhausted a lot of their stamina.</p>
<p>There was no way they could properly deal with Lee Jihye and Kim Namwoon.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi, run!"</p>
<p>I ran on the path that they had made for me.</p>
<p>Lee Jihye shouted.</p>
<p>I left behind the dizzying fear of life and quickened my steps. Even though I broke through the two lines of resistance, there were still many troops protecting Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>All of this was the history built up by Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st round.</p>
<p>"Stop him."</p>
<p>Following Lee Seolhwa's self-righteous command, Yoo Joonghyuk’s followers waved their military flags.</p>
<p>"Kill him! He’s trying to assassinate the king!"</p>
<p>Even if [Incite] was used, it was a difficult number to handle. To force these people to step down through [Incite], I may not have enough magic power to destroy the 'absolute throne'.</p>
<p>It was then that a disturbing noise was heard from the left side of the troops.</p>
<p>"Kaaaaaaaa! What!"</p>
<p>A crowd was running, breaking the ranks of followers.</p>
<p>"Aaaah! Brother Inho!"</p>
<p>A man who bumped his body here and there and pushed in like a tank.</p>
<p>A mother and daughter were also seen swinging kitchen knives to the left and right of the man.</p>
<p>"Bang Cheolsoo!"</p>
<p>As if responding to my shout, Bang Cheolsoo opened the road with a loud shout.</p>
<p>"Go!"</p>
<p>The way to the absolute throne was opened.</p>
<p>「The people that Lee Hakhyun saved were there.」</p>
<p>I ran the road they opened for me.</p>
<p>「As if to say that his story is not wrong.」</p>
<p>The people who lived such a sloppy story. Those who willingly accepted the clumsy changes I wrote, opened the path for me to run.</p>
<p>It was then that something crashed into the center of the road.</p>
<p>A spirit that takes your breath away just by looking at it. A huge shadow as if Mount Tai was blocking my view.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi. I can’t allow you to advance any more."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk’s strongest shield, Lee Hyunsung.</p>
<p>His large right hand moved towards my head. It was [Smashing Mount Tai].</p>
<p>I instinctively raised my magic power. If I am hit by that attack, I will be at least seriously injured.</p>
<p>I quickly lowered my head to avoid his right hand. But his left hand was waiting below him. The [Taesan Push] embedded in the shield was pushed exactly in the direction I was avoiding. It was an unavoidable blow. The moment I opened my mouth to activate [Incite].</p>
<p>A loud noise exploded before my eyes.</p>
<p>When I rolled on the floor and looked forward, the first thing I saw was Lee Hyunsung's shocked face.</p>
<p>"How-"</p>
<p>The steel shield that Lee Hyunsung was holding was split in half and rolling on the floor. Something had pushed Lee Hyunsung’s attack and shattered his shield.</p>
<p>I also understood his feelings.</p>
<p>At this point, the only incarnation with that level of power is Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>「And there was a sword protecting him.」</p>
<p>However, in this 41st round, there was another incarnation with such power.</p>
<p>"Look at this. This is what happens when you leave me and go alone."</p>
<p>The only incarnation in this world who is not afraid of Yoo Joonghyuk's sword.</p>
<p>「The only sword that protected Kim Dokja in the third world line.」</p>
<p>I said her name.</p>
<p>"Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p>"I’ll ask you what happened later, so get up first. There’s something you have to do, right?"</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, the judge of destruction, raised me up and spoke.</p>
<p>"Do your job. I will deal with that big guy."</p>
<p>"Stop!"</p>
<p>Lee Hyunsung stretched out his hand in embarrassment, and Jung Heewon swung her sword at him.</p>
<p>The strongest sword and the strongest shield collided, causing harsh vibrations to echo throughout the area.</p>
<p>After leaving the fight between the two behind, I looked up into the sky.</p>
<p>The distance between the absolute throne that was soaring high into the sky and Yoo Joonghyuk was not much now.</p>
<p>There was no time to hesitate.</p>
<p>"I will receive a hidden scenario reward."</p>
<p>[Pending 'Hidden Scenario' rewards will be paid.]</p>
<p>[You have hunted a disaster for the first time in a scenario!]</p>
<p>[An incredible achievement has been achieved!]</p>
<p>[90,000 coins were obtained!]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[The management bureau grants you a scenario privilege.]</p>
<p>[You can choose one of the items below as a reward.]</p>
<fieldset>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">[Black Flame Half Armor: SSS grade]</h3>
<p>[Sylphid's Leaping Boots: SSS grade]</p>
<p>[Fire Dragon Egg: SS grade]</p>
<p>…</p>
</fieldset>
<p>A mental list of perk items.</p>
<p>I answered without even reading the entire list.</p>
<p>"Sylphid’s Leaping Boots."</p>
<p>An item that Kim Dokja did not choose. But for me now, it was an item I needed more than anything else.</p>
<p>[Obtained 'Sylphid’s Leaping Boots '!]</p>
<p>My toes felt cool and a gentle breeze wrapped around my ankles.</p>
<p>[Special option: Activates leap.]</p>
<p>I just stepped into the air with all my might. As I rose all the way to the sky, Yoo Joonghyuk was finally right in front of me.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p>Now I have arrived.</p>
<p>However, I was not yet ready to crush the absolute throne. This was because there was no one to speak up for the proclaimers.</p>
<p>So, for now, I grabbed Yoo Joonghyuk. I thought it was distance that separated him from the throne, but the moment I held on to the guy's arm with all my strength, the space in front of my eyes suddenly shuddered.</p>
<p>[The 'Theatre of the Beginning' is activated.]</p>
<p>My vision swirled as if I was being sucked into a wall. When I came to my senses from dizziness. I was thrown into an unfamiliar place.</p>
<p>—Yoo Joonghyuk! Yoo Joonghyuk!</p>
<p>—Now the era of supremacy begins!</p>
<p>People's shouts heard through old speakers. I blinked and saw a huge screen. The scenery of Gwanghwamun was projected on the screen.</p>
<p>I looked at the scene blankly and slowly turned my head.</p>
<p>The familiar darkness of the theater captivated me. Hundreds of seats that glow in the dark. Hundreds of readers occupied those seats.</p>
<p>【You’ve finally arrived.】</p>
<p>The kkomas Kim Dokja were looking at me. Some have a flushed face, some have a sad face.</p>
<p>In the center of them, someone was talking and clapping his hands at the wall.</p>
<p>【Our abandoned protagonist.】</p>
<p>As expected, he was someone I knew well.</p>
<p>Representative Kim Dokja stood up with a face full of joy and said.</p>
<p>【Let us welcome '49% Kim Dokja' with joy.】</p>
