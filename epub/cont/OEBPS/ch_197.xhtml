<hr/>
<p>「The universe suddenly began one day. No one knows what happened before that.」</p>
<p>Perhaps that is why the 'Oldest Dream' must continue to dream.」</p>
<p>—Lost guide</p>
<hr/>
<p>The group members expressed their admiration as they saw Yoo Joonghyuk step forward.</p>
<p>Perhaps my companions also remembered 'that line'. Yoo Joonghyuk said a similar line when he killed Poseidon.</p>
<p>"Oooooh!"</p>
<p>"It sounds like something I’ve heard before."</p>
<p>"As expected, it’s Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p>"Ah."</p>
<p>"I can’t believe the day has come when I hear that in person."</p>
<p>Dansu ahjussi, Kyung Sein, Killer King, Cha Yerin, and Ye Hyunwoo took turns spitting out a word and looking back at me at the same time.</p>
<p>No one opened their mouths, but I could tell what everyone was curious about.</p>
<p>"So is that real?"</p>
<p>If you think about it with common sense, there is no way he could have killed a Historical-grade Constellation twice in just 41 rounds.</p>
<p>So that's why they're asking.</p>
<p>I nodded slightly. That's real. Because this '41st Round' is special.</p>
<p>"Oooh!"</p>
<p>As if she had received some sort of permission from my answer, Kyung Sein was excited and clapped her hands as she chanted his name.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk! Yoo Joonghyuk! Yoo Joonghyuk!"</p>
<p>Dansu ahjussi also screamed in excitement.</p>
<p>Killer King nodded and muttered quietly.</p>
<p>"Go, Supreme King."</p>
<p>Amid the noisy cheering, Yoo Joonghyuk glanced towards us.</p>
<p>Seeing the line between his eyebrows, he must be in a bad mood.</p>
<p>Well, I think it would be burdensome if he suddenly received support like that.</p>
<p>Finally, his eyes turned to me. Afterwards, an [electric sound] was heard.</p>
<p>—After I kill that guy, it’s your turn.</p>
<p>Ugh, why?</p>
<p>There was a memory that suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p>「"Eat, you bastard!"」</p>
<p>Could it be because of being fed dirt?</p>
<p>But it's unfair.</p>
<p>I have never fed dirt to this guy. I just fed them the 'story of eating dirt'.</p>
<p>The guy who was controlled by the story picked up the dirt and ate it himself.</p>
<p>Damn, this is why I was hoping his memories would come back late.</p>
<p>Still, fortunately, it was a consolation to know that there was someone who would fall with me before me.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' is wary of the incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p>
<p>It was an unexpected reaction.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, this would have been an indignant moment, saying, "You’re going to kill me when you're just an incarnation?" or rushing in, shouting, "You bastard, how dare you!"</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' glares at the incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' with a cautious expression.]</p>
<p>He wasn't a 'reader' anymore.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, being so wary of Yoo Joonghyuk means that the stories that control him are conscious of Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that he may have read the 'reader’s' memories.</p>
<p>[Could you have become a transcendental being?]</p>
<p>Transcendent.</p>
<p>The only mortal title that can fight against the immortal Constellations in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p>However, as I remember, Yoo Joonghyuk has not yet transcended. If he had 'transcended', a system message would have already appeared.</p>
<p>"I can defeat you even without transcendence."</p>
<p>[A mortal who cannot even transcend would dare to face the Constellations?]</p>
<p>That's right, you should come out like that.</p>
<p>Judging from the way he spoke, it seemed like the story 'old and sick guardian spirit' was active again.</p>
<p>The more he behaves like a stereotypical Constellation, the more likely he is to lose.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' roars!]</p>
<p>The 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' is a Historical-grade Constellation that utilizes some of the power of his true body.</p>
<p>Although he was somewhat limited by probability, he was a more powerful being than the demon marquis he fought earlier.</p>
<p>So this time, Yoo Joonghyuk also has to do his best.</p>
<p>['Redemption of Truth' is activated.]</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Yoo Joonghyuk activated 'Story Imprint'.</p>
<p>[Part of incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk's memories are sealed.]</p>
<p>Redemption of Truth is a 'story imprint' that unleashes power at the cost of sealing some of the memories of the previous rounds.</p>
<p>Fragments of memories flowed into me as they were sealed before my eyes.</p>
<p>「"Leader."」</p>
<p>That is Yoo Joonghyuk's memory that was not written down in 'Ways of Survival' or 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint'.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's 24th round.</p>
<p>「"I have a favor to ask, Captain."」</p>
<p>The scenery of the wide sea shimmered and waves waved before my eyes.</p>
<p>Was it a scenario played out on the coast? Yoo Joonghyuk and Shin Yoosoung were on the beach where the wreckage of broken ships washed up. The young girl had a large hole in her abdomen.</p>
<p>「"I want to go back to school someday."」</p>
<p>A wound that cannot be healed by either the 'Spirit of Elaine Forest' or the 'Great Hwandan'.</p>
<p>The girl hid the wound with her hand and pretended not to notice the wound.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung held her breath in Yoo Joonghyuk's arms.</p>
<p>「"If this world ends safely—"」</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung also knows.</p>
<p>Schools will never reopen. Students will not return. She will never go to school.</p>
<p>「"Please come to the graduation ceremony."」</p>
<p>Even though she knew it all, Shin Yoosoung had no choice but to say that.</p>
<p>Even though she knew very well what kind of eternity it would be remembered by Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk now answers that eternal question.</p>
<p>"I can’t go to your graduation ceremony, but—"</p>
<p>His 24th attempt failed. The world has been destroyed and past history will never return.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung of the 24th Round did not graduate.</p>
<p>"I won’t let you die before me."</p>
<p>His memories were being sealed.</p>
<p>If it were the Yoo Joonghyuk I knew, he would never have sealed it. However, the more important memories are sealed, the more powerful the 'Redemption of Truth' is.</p>
<p>Now, Yoo Joonghyuk needs a 'power' that strong.</p>
<p>I stretched out my hand. I wanted to shout that those memories should not be sealed. If you forget that memory, the world will be as if it never happened.</p>
<p>But at that moment, my eyes met with Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>"I."</p>
<p>It may be an absurd leap.</p>
<p>There's no way Yoo Joonghyuk in the 41st round would think like that.</p>
<p>But now, Yoo Joonghyuk knew clearly that I was looking at his memories, and that I was the only one witnessing the memories he would lose.</p>
<p>"I want you to remember this memory for me."</p>
<p>I read and reread Yoo Joonghyuk's memories being sealed with my fists clenched. I remembered the disappearing Shin Yoosoung and the 24th Round without missing a single word.</p>
<p>When I nodded, Yoo Joonghyuk turned his gaze.</p>
<p>[All comprehensive abilities of incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' temporarily exceed the scenario limit standards!]</p>
<p>[Explosive power surges from your entire body!]</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk took a leap forward with a tremendous energy. Magical power was overflowing from the guy's whole body.</p>
<p>Quad deud deuk!</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's rushing sword strike collided with the front paws of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake'.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk lifted one seal from the Washington Dome and reached the same level as the 'Demon Marquis'.</p>
<p>But this time, that level of force is not enough.</p>
<p>[Just that much!]</p>
<p>While listening to the Constellation's planned message, Yoo Joonghyuk immediately opened the second narrative engraving.</p>
<p>[Incarnation 'Yoo Jonhhyuk' activates 'Restraint of Emotions'!]</p>
<p>Restraint of Emotions.</p>
<p>I'm nervous. This is because it reminded me of the 'Black Beast' that turned Washington Dome into hell.</p>
<p>At that time, there was the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p>However, if Yoo Joonghyuk's transformation into a beast progresses this time, who can stop him?</p>
<p>—Do your part properly this time.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's voice reached my ears.</p>
<p>A little belatedly, I remembered my promise with him. The reason he wanted to take me to the Washington scenario.</p>
<p>「"You stop it."」</p>
<p>He trusted that I would get him back to normal when he had a problem.</p>
<p>"I’ll try."</p>
<p>A word I muttered without realizing it.</p>
<p>Killer King glanced in my direction. Fortunately, Yoo Joonghyuk's transformation began before Killer King could even open his mouth.</p>
<p>I watched his transformation with bated breath.</p>
<p>Will he become a 'black beast' again this time, or...?</p>
<p>[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'’s story engraving skill has increased significantly.]</p>
<p>['Restraint of Emotions' evolves!]</p>
<p>With a dazzling beam of light, pitch-black hair covered Yoo Joonghyuk's entire body. But this time he was not the 'black beast'.</p>
<p>The pitch-black hair grew in an instant, followed by a fur coat reminiscent of the [Beast Lord's sensitivity] used by 'Beast Lord' Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p>The difference is that Yoo Joonghyuk's fur coat was black.</p>
<p>Killer King, who was watching the scene from the side, widened his eyes.</p>
<p>"Long hair, fur coat… Could it be the Emperor of Heilang?"</p>
<p>Normally, I would have retorted to Killer King's nonsense, but this time, I was so overwhelmed by Yoo Joonghyuk's atmosphere that I couldn't think of anything else to say.</p>
<p>Wearing a black fur coat, Yoo Joonghyuk really looked like a prince of the demon world who reigned over ten thousand horses.</p>
<p>Maybe that is another form of the 'Black Beast'.</p>
<p>[How—]</p>
<p>While the story of the 'old and sick guardian deity' continued to lurk in secret, Yoo Joonghyuk’s new form moved.</p>
<p>It's so fast that you can't even see it.</p>
<p>Even after learning [Way of the Wind], it was a speed that I couldn't follow with my eyes.</p>
<p>The astonished tiger screamed. However, neither the rushing spears nor the tiger's paws could catch Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>No story in this world could redeem Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>Breaking The Sky Sword Technique.</p>
<p>A skill that has been trained and trained to reach its peak.</p>
<p>In a sense, the 'Recycling Center' was his solo stage.</p>
<p>All of his techniques have gone beyond the level of 'skill'. In other words, it is not restricted by skill seals.</p>
<p>Breaking The Sky Meteor Strike.</p>
<p>A meteor blossomed in the swordplay of 'Sain Tragedy Sword'. Stars cried out above every trace of the sword.</p>
<p>"Gaaaaaagh!"</p>
<p>The ghosts hit by the meteor fragments disappeared into light.</p>
<p>Truly overwhelming force.</p>
<p>The meteor shower pierced every part of the tiger’s body like a storm.</p>
<p>[Kaaaaaa!]</p>
<p>The Constellation's scream spread throughout Zone 13.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Liverless Rabbit' opens its eyes in astonishment!]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Rat spreading plague’ is scared.]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' holds his breath.]</p>
<p>The slowly moving front paw of the tiger. Yoo Joonghyuk did not miss the short gap and fired back and forth.</p>
<p>The sword dug into the hole pierced by the meteor shower, connecting the holes like connecting Constellations.</p>
<p>With the sound of something breaking, the tiger's front paw flew through the air.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Reclining Dragon' is overwhelmed by the power of the incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'The One Who Brought Ten Lambs' cannot take their eyes off incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p>
<p>I felt a thrill amidst the ecstatic tales scattered throughout.</p>
<p>「A black wolf was hunting a tiger.」</p>
<p>There was no human feeling in the graceful movement of the sword. What was reflected in the trajectory was simply the time of hardship endured by Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>Memories of training his sword day and night to defeat the Constellations in the sky.</p>
<p>[K-keaaaa—my arm! My arm—how dare you—!]</p>
<p>All those memories were concentrated and summed up in a single body.</p>
<p>He narrowed the distance with the gait of [Red Pheonix Steps], blocked incoming blows with [Defense Strength], and dealt with the oncoming spear ghosts with [Hundred Step God Fist].</p>
<p>And cut the Constellation with [Breaking The Sky Swordsmanship].</p>
<p>Breaking The Sky Mad King’s Dance.</p>
<p>Dozens of sword lights pierced both legs of the tiger. One knee buckled, and then the other knee buckled again.</p>
<p>The huge tiger's body lost its balance and fell forward. Yoo Joonghyuk didn't let go of the opportunity and flew towards the guy's neck.</p>
<p>He was only on his eighth scenario.</p>
<p>In the eighth scenario, Yoo Joonghyuk was trying to accomplish the feat of dropping a Constellation from the sky with his own strength.</p>
<p>[The story 'Old and Sick Guardian Deity' disappears.]</p>
<p>[The story 'Rotten Dongajul' is activated in exchange for the 'Old and Sick Guardian Deity'!]</p>
<p>「Rotten Dongajul.」</p>
<p>The unique story of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' who escaped a desperate crisis.</p>
<p>[The story 'Rotten Dongajul' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>Although it was a similar technique to Nirvana's [No Possession], this story demanded a more terrible price than [No Possession].</p>
<p>Just before Yoo Joonghyuk's sword touched the guy's neck, a bright red fireball burst out from the tiger's chest along with the sound of fu-chem. Red snowflakes were scattered on the ground, creating a red sorghum field.</p>
<p>The image of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' began to disperse like smoke among the blood-stained sorghum fields.</p>
<p>[I am dissatisfied. Since I was unable to get the little one—]</p>
<p>The mantra of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' rang out as if he were sorrowful.</p>
<p>His gaze full of hatred that had been on me soon turned to someone else.</p>
<p>[I will take the other one.]</p>
