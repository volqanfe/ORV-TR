<hr/>
<p>"I am."</p>
<p>I couldn't answer right away.</p>
<p>Obviously, I wasn't that 'Cheon Inho'. Their way of thinking was different, and their likes and dislikes were different.</p>
<p>Their soul was different.</p>
<p>But can I really say that I have nothing to do with that 'Cheon Inho'?</p>
<p>I possessed his body, and before I possessed it, I wrote a sentence about him.</p>
<p>I made 'Cheon Inho' with my own hands.</p>
<p>Even if Han Sooyoung wrote the first draft, I had plenty of opportunities to change the sentences.</p>
<p>If so, maybe I—</p>
<p>"You are a different person."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon frowned as if she didn't understand why I was taking so long.</p>
<p>"No matter how you look at it, you're a different person. I also saw that world. You have different personalities, and you look closely... Cheon Inho here is more attractive."</p>
<p>I couldn't figure out what the hell she was talking about.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi said, 'Another world'. Then, isn't it a world that doesn't exist on this side? It's like a world in a novel."</p>
<p>A world of fiction.</p>
<p>"The reason I asked is because I just wanted to hear a set answer. That's all. So tell me. Inho-ssi, are you the same person as Cheon Inho in that world?"</p>
<p>I suddenly came to my senses.</p>
<p>The hand that Jung Heewon reached out to first. If I didn't hold this hand, that wasn't polite either.</p>
<p>"I'm not like him. At least I think so."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>But is that really enough?</p>
<p>Will she be able to understand and move on with that alone?</p>
<p>"The Cheon Inho I believe in is only the Cheon Inho in front of me right now."</p>
<p>As if [inciting] herself, Jung Heewon said.</p>
<p>"So Inho-ssi too."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, who came towards me, said while putting the blade on the floor.</p>
<p>"Think of the me in front of you right now as Jung Heewon. Except for Jung Heewon from 'The Future You Know'."</p>
<p>Only then did I know why she brought up this topic.</p>
<p>「The Jung Heewon in front of me is not the Jung Heewon of 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』.」</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, who was the sword of Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, who killed Cheon Inho.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, the only incarnation of the Demon-like Judge of Fire and the guardian of &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;.</p>
<p>That Jung Heewon is not here.</p>
<p>As I am not 'Cheon Inho', she is also in the stories of the apostles.</p>
<p>She is not that 'Jung Heewon'.</p>
<p>[There is only one Jung Heewon in the 41st turn.]</p>
<p>I sincerely nodded.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon smiled.</p>
<p>"If I fall off a bridge again, will you save me?"</p>
<p>"A few times."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon sighed lightly, bent down to pick up her sword from the floor, and lightly tilted her head.</p>
<p>"I said something too complicated, not like me. Actually, I don't want to think difficult things right now. I like simple things."</p>
<p>Certainly, the Jung Heewon I knew wasn't one to talk about things like this.</p>
<p>"I just want to cut, stab, and somehow survive. That's all I want to do."</p>
<p>"That's enough for now. Instead, please do it by my side."</p>
<p>At those words, Jung Heewon lifted her head at a subtle angle and looked at me.</p>
<p>"I could stab Inho-ssi by mistake?"</p>
<p>"Then I'll die."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon thought it was a joke and laughed.</p>
<p>"That can't be done. Inho-ssi, please come so that I don't stab the wrong person."</p>
<p>"Of course. By the way."</p>
<p>As I slowly looked around the restaurant, I asked a question I had been wanting to ask all along.</p>
<p>"Haven't you already stabbed one?"</p>
<p>There was only one other person in the restaurant besides us.</p>
<p>To be precise, at Jung Heewon’s feet.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The man was still breathing.</p>
<p>He was a man whose peculiarities were hard to find except that he was pretending to be homeless.</p>
<p>Well, even that is a feature that has little meaning at this point when everyone is homeless.</p>
<p>"The sniper you just caught? Was there a real sniper?"</p>
<p>"There is."</p>
<p>The man, whose whole body was tightly bound, let out intermittent moans as if he were trying to detach himself.</p>
<p>"Even though the gun was a toy gun."</p>
<p>I checked [character list].</p>
<p>Although he didn't have any particularly great stats or characteristics, there was one skill that stood out.</p>
<p>[Strengthen bullets.]</p>
<p>A skill that changes toy bullets into power comparable to normal bullets. It seemed that he was targeting us with this skill.</p>
<p>After hitting the man on the cheek several times, the man who suddenly came to his senses began crying and begging her.</p>
<p>"Sa-save me! Please!"</p>
<p>"Which group do you belong to?"</p>
<p>I slammed the pot on the floor next to the man's head and asked. After all, this guy is the one who tried to shoot on us.</p>
<p>I was wondering if I should pretend to torture him, but the man shouted in a fit.</p>
<p>"Damn, Beggar! Beggar Sect!"</p>
<p>He spit it out easier than I thought.</p>
<p>By the way... Beggars?</p>
<p>Jung Heewon asked if she had read my expression.</p>
<p>"A group you know?"</p>
<p>I subtly nodded.</p>
<p>There is probably no web novelist who is unaware of the concept of the Beggar Sect.</p>
<p>Because it is the name of the Bangpa that appears regularly in martial arts novels.</p>
<p>The Beggar Sect was a place that represented 'one of the old sects' in Murim.</p>
<p>That is to say, if it was set at a normal time, it was like that.</p>
<p>If there's a problem, I know that the 'Beggar Sect' doesn't come out in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>"Where are your headquarters?"</p>
<p>"That, that's..."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, who was by his side, picked up a knife.</p>
<p>"Above, the location! It's hard to tell because it's so wide, but the main base is on the Seoul Station side!</p>
<p>"Who is the head of the group?"</p>
<p>"It’s Cheongae!"</p>
<p>Opening, Cheongae, Seoul Station.</p>
<p>The first two were never described in detail even when reading the book, but it was different for Seoul Station.</p>
<p>According to my memory, it is because Kim Dokja once monologued as follows.</p>
<p>「Still, that's cute enough. Compared to those in Chungmuro or Seoul Station.」</p>
<p>That was the only description of 'Seoul Station' I read in all of the novel.</p>
<p>I tried to think of other notes, but nothing particularly came to mind.</p>
<p>This is because the vicinity of Seoul Station was only mentioned, but no specific framework was established.</p>
<p>In other words, it means that Han Sooyoung did not convey it to me.</p>
<p>"Why were you spying on us?"</p>
<p>"Chew, the commander told me to keep an eye on the road to expand our power. That's really all. I didn't mean to hurt you!"</p>
<p>Looking at his expression, I thought it was real. After thinking for a while, I suddenly looked down at the man's waist.</p>
<p>Three knots hanging from the waist.</p>
<p>Look at this.</p>
<p>Looking at the knot, I pondered and asked the man.</p>
<p>"Can you specify?"</p>
<hr/>
<p>The man could only be released from us after repeated [oaths of existence].</p>
<p>The specifications were simple.</p>
<p>「About us, don't report it to the representative no matter what.」</p>
<p>The leaving man kept bowing his head this way and repeating his thanks.</p>
<p>[Currently, a number of targets have contracted the 'Oath of Existence’.]</p>
<p>[As the number of targets of the 'Existence Specification' increases, the power of the 'Oath' weakens.]</p>
<p>This is another penalty I didn't know about.</p>
<p>Maybe that's why they didn't make the 'Oath to Existence' often in the main story?</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, who watched him walk away, asked.</p>
<p>"Can we let him live?"</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is startled by your behavior.]</p>
<p>"Do you think my judgment is wrong?"</p>
<p>"I just think it's Inho-ssi."</p>
<p>"There is a reason I saved him."</p>
<p>Perhaps that group has already obtained permission for [group chat].</p>
<p>In other words, there was a high possibility that the man did not give information to nearby group members the moment he was caught by Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>In other words, in some way, the information has already been passed on to the other group.</p>
<p>"It's not an ordinary group. The hierarchy within the organization has already been established."</p>
<p>"A hierarchy?"</p>
<p>I explained about the knot tied around the man's waist.</p>
<p>Originally, the group called 'Beggars Sect' is the group of 'beggars' in martial arts novels.</p>
<p>Unusually, they reveal their rank with a 'knot' on their waist. For example, regular members have one 'knot'. Buntaju-class knot 'three'. Dangju’s level is the same as 'five'.</p>
<p>"That person had three knots. That means he's on the Buntaju level."</p>
<p>"What is Buntaju?"</p>
<p>"That… In terms of a company, you can roughly think of it as an assistant manager or a manager."</p>
<p>"Isn't it high?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but it is important that there is a rank."</p>
<p>As far as I know, there are up to nine open knots in total.</p>
<p>Just now, since that guy was in the middle ranks, it means that there are six more levels above him.</p>
<p>It's only in the early stages of the scenario, but it was truly surprising that they had already created a group of that size.</p>
<p>"Is this a group created by people who like martial arts novels?"</p>
<p>"It could be that way, or-"</p>
<p>It could be that the constellation is related to Murim.</p>
<p>Either way, it was an opponent that could not be good because we were now hostile.</p>
<p>Above all, 'Kim Dokja' had a group comparable to Chungmuro, so it must be judged that they have at least ten medicines.</p>
<p>Of course, this side has Jung Heewon, but Jung Heewon's real skills are displayed when dealing with monsters rather than people.</p>
<p>"What if he brings a gang? He said he swore, but you never know."</p>
<p>"It'll be all right if he comes."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>If they still come to attack us, then it is a war with clear intentions.</p>
<p>"At that time, you'll be free to kill them."</p>
<p>I wondered if I had made a great remark, but Jung Heewon smiled.</p>
<p>"I like that."</p>
<p>Somehow, it felt like a very bloody duo was created.</p>
<p>I replied with a wry smile.</p>
<p>"Then let’s set off. Did you say Yoo Joonghyuk went north?"</p>
<p>"Well, there’s one thing I didn’t tell you about earlier," Jung Heewon added, scratching her cheek.</p>
<p>"That person, Yoo Joonghyuk, said one more word before he left."</p>
<p>I thought it might be. Yoo Joonghyuk looks cool on the outside, but he is secretly a guy with a lot of lingering feelings.</p>
<p>"The current Cheon Inho cannot be recognized as Cheon Inho. But-"</p>
<p>"But?"</p>
<p>"If we recruit a person as a colleague, he says he will think about recognizing you as 'Cheon Inho'."</p>
<p>It's not about acknowledging me, thinking about acknowledging me is also good.</p>
<p>"The mad butcher... he said you would understand."</p>
<p>"A mad butcher?"</p>
<p>A sentence came to mind.</p>
<p>Apparently, there was one incarnation with such a nickname.</p>
<p>["One of the 100 strongest people in Ways of Survival, the 'Mad Butcher', eventually evolved from the 'Crouching Figure'.]</p>
<p>Surprisingly, however, this person was only mentioned once and passed by. After that, it is not even mentioned whether he is dead or alive.</p>
<p>It's the 100 strongest people in Ways of Survival...</p>
<p>After all, Han Sooyoung didn't tell me this, so there's probably no mention of it.</p>
<p>By the way, Yoo Joonghyuk is looking for that mad butcher...</p>
<p>The story turns out in a fun way.</p>
<p>"Anyone you know?"</p>
<p>"That's what I've heard of."</p>
<p>As soon as I was about to say, "I don't know him," I felt a slight pain in my head once again.</p>
<p>[A new skill is active]</p>
<p>New skill?</p>
<p>「'Mad Butcher' was born at 'Seoul Station' that day.」</p>
<p>A thought that came to my mind.</p>
<p>Since when was it?</p>
<p>Goosebumps slowly formed on my forearms.</p>
<p>It wasn't a sentence that I came up with in particular, nor was it a sentence that originally came out in 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<p>It wasn't even a setting I made, and it wasn't a sentence I would write in the future.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World' is active.]</p>
<p>That is the story that Kim Dokja loved more than anyone else.</p>
<p>It was a sentence of 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
