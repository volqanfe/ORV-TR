<hr/>
<p>I like your story.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja's words left deep ripples in my heart.</p>
<p>Some words make me realize that I wanted to hear them all along after hearing them.</p>
<p>I looked into his face.</p>
<p>His name was Kim Dokja. A character I wrote about in 551 chapters.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint', becomes more powerfully activated.]</p>
<p>I could tell what he was thinking just by looking at his expression.</p>
<p>【The Fear Realm will be destroyed. I'll call a train, so get out of here.】</p>
<p>"That can't be."</p>
<p>The King of Fear looked back silently. An eerie light was continuously flowing out from beyond the doorway of the 'Big House'. It was Zeus's tale.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the screams of the Transcendents were scattered. I could also hear the sound of the Toothy Fins howling in pain.</p>
<p>"Let's get out of here together."</p>
<p>Why he liked my story, maybe I knew.</p>
<p>The Second Kim Dokja, who had been hiding in the 'Fear Realm' since the moment he was born.</p>
<p>In a sense, this 'Fear Realm' was another 'Snowfield' for Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>He must have hidden between the lines, collecting Fears, and reading and rereading the stories he had already read.</p>
<p>The Second Kim Dokja stared at me with calm eyes.</p>
<p>【You know what will happen if I leave here.】</p>
<p>The Second Kim Dokja made a light gesture, and a small screen rose into the air.</p>
<p>—It's been destroyed!</p>
<p>—The disaster has fallen!</p>
<p>His shards that had advanced into the scenario were dying after being attacked by the incarnations. His butterfly wings were torn, and the 'Nameless Things' that protected him collapsed.</p>
<p>【Not only me, but the 'Gods of the Other World' will suffer the same thing every time. As long as this &lt;Star Stream&gt; exists.】</p>
<p>"So you tried to make the &lt;Star Stream&gt; itself a 'Fear Realm'?"</p>
<p>The King of Fear smiled brightly.</p>
<p>【Failed, but.】</p>
<p>It was bound to fail.</p>
<p>In this world where someone's sorrow is simply a story, he who entered the scenario will only become a disaster. All the stars and incarnations will gather their strength to drive him out, and then plant a brilliant flag of victory in the place where his sorrow was.</p>
<p>【Still, it had to be done.】</p>
<p>"Why did it have to be now? Is it because I read the 'Prophecy of the End'?"</p>
<p>I thought of the 'Prophecy of the End' I had read when I entered the 'Transcendent Alliance'.</p>
<p>「The Fears that have begun to be recorded will return to being stories. They will become established stories. They will be written down in history again.」</p>
<p>When that day comes, the boundary of sleep will open, and the King of Fear will descend.</p>
<p>And only the one who defeats the King of Fear will become the last storyteller who denies all records at the boundary between dreams and reality.」</p>
<p>The 'Prophecy of the End' that hinted at the birth and death of the 'King of Fear'. The King of Fear looked at me quietly and shook his head.</p>
<p>【Everything is already written, and is being written at the same time.】</p>
<p>The King of Fear muttered those words lowly and then quietly added.</p>
<p>【The current 'Fear Realm' cannot accommodate all the Outer Gods. It was going to happen eventually. The prophecy was just a trigger.】</p>
<p>"But—"</p>
<p>【Go away. With your colleagues.】</p>
<p>As the King of Fear reached out, Anna Croft and Yoo Joonghyuk, who had fainted inside the doorway of the 'Big House', came out floating in the air.</p>
<p>I caught them with both hands and spoke again.</p>
<p>"I won't go. No, I can't go."</p>
<p>The King of Fear looked at me for a moment as if he was frustrated. I heard the sound of lighting flashing from behind me once again.</p>
<p>【There's no time. If you keep refusing, I'll absorb you.】</p>
<p>The moment I met his compound eyes, my heart pounded loudly. An uncomfortable aura flowed from his appearance as he approached step by step.</p>
<p>【I will absorb you and take all of your stories. I will gather the fragments and dye the &lt;Star Stream&gt; in Fear. I will create a world where everyone fears each other and no one can harm each other.】</p>
<p>At the same time, story stirred inside me.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', growls.]</p>
<p>I answered with my eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>"If you can, try. But I will never leave you alone."</p>
<p>【There's nothing I can do.】</p>
<p>The next moment, the King of Fear opened his mouth wide. The distant darkness inside his mouth greedily overflowed.</p>
<p>【You brought this upon yourself.】</p>
<p>The darkness swallowed me up.</p>
<hr/>
<p>rlaehrwk37: What? What happened?</p>
<hr/>
<p>The King of Fear opened his eyes.</p>
<p>The power of stories welling up inside him. The King of Fear took several calming breaths as if to calm his power.</p>
<p>How long did he continue breathing like that? The 'Time Fault Room' began to shake dangerously.</p>
<p>[The Constellation, 'Lightning Seat', manifests its own power!]</p>
<p>Finally, Zeus's incarnation reached the doorway of the 'Big House'.</p>
<p>Of course, Zeus was not the only one to appear.</p>
<p>【Ooooooooh!】</p>
<p>This is the 'Time Fault' Room!</p>
<p>The 'Divine Beings of the Other World' began to come in earnest through the entrances of countless Time Faults.</p>
<p>Catastrophe, Disaster, Natural Disaster.</p>
<p>A legion of Fear that could literally destroy this world.</p>
<p>Following that, Zeus's lightning spear Astraphe appeared beyond the doorway of the 'Big House'. It seemed as if pure white electricity was dyeing the sky, and in the next moment, the entire space was cleanly annihilated. Fragments of the stories of the fallen Outer Gods hovered around the 'Time Fault' room. The angry Outer Gods screamed.</p>
<p>【Ah... So, changing the history of this 'worldline'.】</p>
<p>[You probably know that you have no choice now.]</p>
<p>Even Jang Hayoung, who cleared the 1,864th round, could not stop their fleet.</p>
<p>In front of the overwhelming power of the &lt;Olympus&gt; fleet led by Zeus, there were only two choices.</p>
<p>Surrender here and be subject to &lt;Olympus&gt;, or disappear with the Fear Realm.</p>
<p>The King of Fear said.</p>
<p>【You guys, it seems you have forgotten where this place is.】</p>
<p>[Even if this is your dream, you cannot stop us.]</p>
<p>Poseidon laughed, as if he had already figured out the power of the 'King of Fear'.</p>
<p>[I know that all you can do is 'dream' to maintain this place.]</p>
<p>The most powerless god in this world.</p>
<p>The 'King of Fear' governs everything in the 'Fear Realm', but he cannot do anything alone.</p>
<p>【That's right. It's a sad story.】</p>
<p>The 'King of Fear' laughed. It was a laugh that was both a sneer and a self-mockery.</p>
<p>With that laugh on his face, the 'King of Fear' said,</p>
<p>【Youngest.】</p>
<p>He called me.</p>
<p>【Remember the end of this story well.】</p>
<p>As expected, I was not absorbed by the 'King of Fear'.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint', is activating.]</p>
<p>[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint activated at a dramatic moment.]</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint', stage 0 is activating.]</p>
<p>「Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 0 that has never been activated. As a result of that stage 0, I was now seeing the world through the eyes of the King of Fear without being absorbed by him.」</p>
<p>[You're bluffing.]</p>
<p>The moment Poseidon aimed Traiana at the King of Fear, the Outer Gods of the 'Time Fault' simultaneously began to howl toward the sky.</p>
<p>The wailing soon covered the entire 'Fear Realm', and soon became a tale.</p>
<p>「A Giant Tale.」</p>
<p>It was a Giant Tale that turned the King of Fear into 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p>[The Giant Tale, 'Season of Light and Darkness', begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>With a sound of tsutsutsu, the scenery of the battlefield began to change.</p>
<p>「Staging.」</p>
<p>It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>In order for 'Staging' to occur, the conditions for the stage to be established must be met.</p>
<p>For example, 「Season of Light and Darkness」 is a tale that occurred on the 'Island of Reincarnation'.</p>
<p>The story that was born when &lt;Eden&gt; and &lt;Demon World&gt; clashed, causing the 'Great War of the Holy Demons', with Kim Dokja leading to the conclusion of it was 「Season of Light and Darkness」.</p>
<p>But now, this place was not the 'Island of Reincarnation', and there were no Constellations representing good and evil.</p>
<p>The only one here was 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p>But how.</p>
<p>[What nonsense—]</p>
<p>It seems that Poseidon and Zeus had the same doubts as me.</p>
<p>「The ruins of the 'Holy Demon War' were spread out there.」</p>
<p>How could the 'Holy Demon War' be recreated here?</p>
<p>[There are no Archangels or Demon Kings here! But how...!]</p>
<p>The answer was simple.</p>
<p>【There are no Archangels or Demon Kings here?】</p>
<p>[What?]</p>
<p>【It's not that you can't see it?】</p>
<p>The Constellations of &lt;Olympus&gt;, including Poseidon, still had faces that they didn't understand.</p>
<p>Only I understood what he was saying.</p>
<p>I sighed and admired, and groaned and despaired. The scenery that I could see because of [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] 'Stage 0' was activated. When did it start?</p>
<p>「The forgotten Archangels and Demon Kings stood beside us.」</p>
<p>No one would call them 'Archangels' or 'Demons' anymore. They had lost their names.</p>
<p>【Goodandevilgoodandevilgoodandevilgoodandevilgoodandevilgoodandevil】</p>
<p>【Lightanddarknesslightanddarknesslight anddarknesslightanddarknesslightanddarknesslightanddarkness】</p>
<p>But there was a time when they also existed in the scenario. There were days when they faced their own battlefield with their own roles.</p>
<p>The old story—their legend, which could only be preserved through the 'Time Fault', was now being released as a 「stage」 here.</p>
<p>【Ohohohohohoh!】</p>
<p>On the stage, I could see the scenery that the 'King of Fear' had been guarding alone.</p>
<p>Only then did I understand the reason for the existence of the Time Fault, and I understood why Outer Gods keep hiding in the gap of the Time Fault.</p>
<p>They have been constantly wandering in search of their lost story and lost hometown.</p>
<p>Poseidon roared and shouted.</p>
<p>[The stage alone is useless. With just that 'Giant Tale'—]</p>
<p>[You don't know what kind of war the 'Holy War' is awakening.]</p>
<p>The 'King of Fear' who said that was truly like Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>[Well, it's not your history.]</p>
<p>Kim Dokja who led the 'Holy War' that day, in that place.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja in history who protected &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; with his own sacrifice.</p>
<p>Kugugugugugu!</p>
<p>The loud noise was heard from the door far above.</p>
<p>「1863-99th round」</p>
<p>The unknown 'Time Fault' next to the 'reset button'.</p>
<p>Beyond the doorway of that Fault, something terrible was rippling.</p>
<p>[Spear That Draws the Boundary of the Sea, what is happening!]</p>
<p>The Twelve Gods of &lt;Olympus&gt; who came through the door late stood as if protecting the Mythical-grade Constellations. However, Zeus and Poseidon simply stared at the 'Time Fault' on the ceiling with bewitched faces.</p>
<p>Among the Twelve Gods, the first to notice the situation was the Blacksmith of the Volcano—Hephaestus.</p>
<p>[Oh my god, that crazy guy right now—]</p>
<p>Only then did they realize what kind of being the 'original form of the outsider' was beyond that doorway.</p>
<p>The shadow of a giant tail swinging beyond the portal of the Time Fault.</p>
<p>「There was the 'Calamity of the Stars'.」</p>
<p>I realized once again that this place was the 'Fear Realm'.</p>
<p>The Fears of this world were classified into several categories.</p>
<p>Catastrophe level, Disaster level, Natural Disaster level.</p>
<p>But there was one more level of classification above these.</p>
<p>End of the story.</p>
<p>A Fear that could possibly threaten this entire &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p>[You, if you do that, you won't be safe either! Everyone here will die!]</p>
<p>The cries of the Constellations were colorless, and the King of Fear slowly raised his hand and called out the Fear.</p>
<p>【Come.】</p>
<p>Chunghuh had said something like that. The Fear of the end is not a 'Fear that can be avoided'.</p>
<p>It is a Fear that 'can only be accepted'.</p>
<p>That Fear was now awakening under the protection of the Giant Tale.</p>
<p>I also knew that Fear. In Han Sooyoung's 'Guide to Fear Realm that Even a Squid and Sunfish Can Understand', the name of that 'Fear' is given as follows:</p>
<p>「Type 1 End-of-the-Story Fear.」</p>
<p>The prototype of that Fear is as follows:</p>
<p>「The Last Dragon of the Apocalypse.」</p>
<p>I could feel the shadow of a giant tail shaking beyond the doorway.</p>
<p>Everyone here knew. That one tail flick would make everything about this 'Fear Realm' disappear.</p>
<p>Tsutsutsutsut!</p>
<p>The aftermath of probability finally began to blow. With the appearance of the last dragon, the 'balance of probability' was completely shattered.</p>
<p>In the center of the Fear Realm that was rushing in with pure white sparks, the god who was more omniscient and incompetent than anyone else spoke.</p>
<p>【As you said, all I can do is 'dream'. But.】</p>
<p>The god's finger pointed at the &lt;Olympus&gt; fleet.</p>
<p>【You are also in my dream.】</p>
<p>Finally, the last dragon's tail moved.</p>
<p>【I always have nightmares.】</p>
