<h3 style="text-align:center;">&lt;Hidden Scenario - Relic of Trials&gt;</h3>
<p>Category: Hidden</p>
<p>Difficulty: F~A+</p>
<p>Clear conditions: Clear the 'Relic Dungeon' for the right number of people.</p>
<p>Time limit: None.</p>
<p>Reward: 500~5,000 coins</p>
<p>Failure: Death</p>
</fieldset>
<p>[Select the type of dungeon to enter.]</p>
<fieldset>
<p>* 1-person dungeon - Field of Nagak</p>
<p>* 3-person dungeon - Acupuncturists’ Field</p>
<p>* 5-person dungeon - Donguibogam</p>
<p>* 7-person dungeon - Yongjun's Jang</p>
</fieldset>
<p>The group of three, including Kim Dokja, arrived here in the main part of the book, and they chose the '3-person dungeon', the 'Acupuncturists' Field'.</p>
<p>Anyway, since I was alone, I had no other options.</p>
<p>"I will choose the one-man dungeon, the Field of Nagak."</p>
<p>[You enter the 1-person dungeon.]</p>
<p>Little information was known about the Field of Nagak.</p>
<p>I checked the 'Ways of Survival' skill and the notes I had written, but nothing came to mind right away.</p>
<p>I can’t help it.</p>
<p>This time, I have to experience it for myself.</p>
<p>[You are the 5th to enter the single-person dungeon.]</p>
<p>At the same time as entering, the 'Ever-Changing Stealth Suit' was deactivated. Because from now on, there was no need to make my body smaller.</p>
<p>The Nagak's field was like a huge terrarium that someone artificially decorated.</p>
<p>The rocky land rose between the puddles that submerge people up to the chin.</p>
<p>Hermit crabs about 1 meter tall were also seen creeping and crawling over the land.</p>
<p>Those must be 'Nagaks'.</p>
<p>[If you defeat more than 100 'Nagak', you will be eligible to escape the dungeon.]</p>
<p>[Obtain 2 Sangpyeong Tongbo as a basic reward for every 100 Nagak hunts.]</p>
<p>In order to enter the 'Chapter of the Big Dipper' where the sword of death lies, you must collect 10 Sangpyeong Tongbo.</p>
<p>In other words, I have to catch at least 500 Nagaks.</p>
<p>As I moved slowly, the nagaks who felt my presence turned their antennae all at once.</p>
<p>[The 8th grade sea species 'Small Nagak' has noticed your presence!]</p>
<p>I still don't know the attack pattern of these guys.</p>
<p>However, I know what kind of instrument a 'Nagak' is. A brass instrument made from conch shells.</p>
<p>According to my guess, their attack method is-</p>
<p>[The Nagak Ensemble begins.]</p>
<p>Ugh, I feel like the air is boiling.</p>
<p>I instinctively looked left and right, then took about twenty steps to the left.</p>
<p>And after a while.</p>
<p>Woo woo woo woo.</p>
<p>There was a deafening roar as if dozens of herds of bison were vomiting at once. I could see the floor on which I had been standing until the moment it was turned into clay with a sound.</p>
<p>As expected, it was an attack using sound.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they did not continue. The monsters stopped crying all at once, probably sucking in their breath to make the sound again.</p>
<p>I started hunting them.</p>
<p>When I approached in an instant and took out 'Broken Faith', the surprised hermit crab tried to defend itself by sticking out a small claw crab.</p>
<p>[The 'Blade of Faith' is activated!]</p>
<p>However, there is no way that an ether blade can be blocked with only a 8th class sea monster's carapace.</p>
<p>While the Nagak, whose claw had been cut off, vomited a sound, I inserted a new sword into the gap in the Nagak.</p>
<p>[You have hunted 1 'Nagak'.]</p>
<p>After learning how to hunt one, it was easy.</p>
<p>Avoiding the 'Nagak ensemble' pouring out at regular intervals, I ran between the conch shells.</p>
<p>Every time I swing the Blade of Faith, one Nagak loses its life.</p>
<p>[You have hunted 23 'Nagaks'.]</p>
<p>[You have hunted 24 'Nagaks'.]</p>
<p>If I feel a little bit out of magic, I bought from the dokkaebi’s bag in advance.</p>
<p>I also used an intermediate magic recovery potion.</p>
<p>[You have hunted 152 'Nagaks'.]</p>
<p>[You have hunted 153 'Nagaks'.]</p>
<p>I didn’t forget to look around to see if there were other incarnations around me.</p>
<p>There weren’t.</p>
<p>Occasionally I could see gear or clothing dropped by people, but I couldn't find a living person.</p>
<p>It was definitely difficult for a single player dungeon.</p>
<p>Defeating hundreds of Nagak and obtaining a notification of the award must be a formidable task for ordinary incarnations.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' rejoices in your growth.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' says that he has caught on to his income.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' says he heard that the horn meat is good for hair loss and strengthening stamina.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband asks if that's true.]</p>
<p>The messages of the constellations came into my head.</p>
<p>After defeating the ark at Seoul Station, I felt that the number of constellations permanently residing in the channel increased.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone in the neighborhood cheered me on, but...</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' complains that it is not fun because there is no crisis.]</p>
<p>In any case, it was around the time that the number of Nagaks I hunted exceeded 400.</p>
<p>[The constellation that has not revealed their modifier warns you that it is not going to be an easy dungeon.]</p>
<p>With a somewhat ominous message, a light vibration occurred throughout the terrarium.</p>
<p>[The number of slaughtered 'Nagak' in the 'Nagak’s Field' has exceeded 400!]</p>
<p>[Someone is very angry at the Nagaks’ death!]</p>
<p>[Higher seawater species appear!]</p>
<p>I saw something rise up in the huge puddle that occupied the center of the 'Nagaks’ Field'.</p>
<p>It was a huge conch shell with a height the size of a small house.</p>
<p>[6th sea species, Ancient Nagak has awakened!]</p>
<p>It's not even 7th grade, it's suddenly 6th grade?</p>
<p>At this point, if it was a 6th sea species, it was not easy to deal for even Jung Heewon who has activated [Time of Judgment].</p>
<p>A tingling feeling of life was transmitted through the hair on my forearm.</p>
<p>Should I run away now?</p>
<p>[Penalty for high-ranking sea species is activated!]</p>
<p>[You cannot escape from the dungeon for the next 10 minutes.]</p>
<p>Unable to escape for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>In other words, if I manage to survive for 10 minutes, I can escape.</p>
<p>[A handful of constellations are now licking their lips saying that it will be a little fun.]</p>
<p>The ancient Nagak twisted its massive body, and before I knew it, his antennae was pointing toward me.</p>
<p>[6th sea species 'Ancient Nagak' has noticed your presence.]</p>
<p>I swallowed lightly and thought.</p>
<p>「To what extent can I fight now?」</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I wasn't that weak.</p>
<p>I got my first story just before the fourth scenario was over, and I raised my overall ability to the limit of the scenario.</p>
<p>There is no 'Unbreakable Faith', but there is 'Broken Faith' that can be infinitely regenerated with 'Thought', and I can use [white and blue steel]. The 'outer suit' obtained in the theater dungeon is still intact.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' says that the meat of the Ancient Nagak is in the limelight as a food to prevent hair loss.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' asks if it's real.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' bets his hair and says it's real.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' says that this 'Bald General of Justice'has never eaten Nagaks’ meat.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[A new bounty scenario has arrived!]</p>
<fieldset>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">&lt;Bounty Scenario - Precious Hair&gt;</h3>
<p>Classification: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: B+</p>
<p>Clear Condition: Hunt the Ancient Nagak and donate the Ancient Nagak to the Prisoner of the Golden Headband.</p>
<p>Time limit: 1 hour.</p>
<p>Reward: 2,000 coins, ???</p>
<p>Failure: —</p>
</fieldset>
<p>I stared blankly at the newly appeared scenario window and suddenly came to my senses.</p>
<p>It was an unexpected opportunity.</p>
<p>Even a 'Bounty Scenario' directly imposed by the Prisoner of the Golden Headband.</p>
<p>If it was Kim Dokja, he would never have missed this opportunity.</p>
<p>After making a light call, I fixed my 'Broken Faith'.</p>
<p>Let's try it.</p>
<p>Because I already know how to attack Nagaks.</p>
<p>Without giving me more time, I ran towards the 'Ancient Nagak'. The plan was to activate the 'blade of faith' with maximum output immediately, and cut down its skin at once.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>Quadddeuk!</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the shell of the 6th grade Sea Species deflected the 'Blade of Faith'.</p>
<p>Strong enough to block the ether blade. The moment I took a few steps in my panic, I heard an ominous vibration.</p>
<p>The 'ensemble' of the ancient Nagak is about to begin.</p>
<p>I quickly stepped back and searched for a place out of reach of sound waves.</p>
<p>A cold sweat ran down my back.</p>
<p>I could feel it instinctively. The ensemble of the 'Ancient Nagak' had a different attack range than the other Nagaks.</p>
<p>I could see the Ancient Nagak tally swaying as if mocking me.</p>
<p>Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!</p>
<p>A huge circular sound wave was emitted from the Ancient Nagak as the center. I reflexively turned my back and ran away.</p>
<p>I had to run as far as possible, to a place where those sound waves couldn't reach.</p>
<p>Bubbeobuck!</p>
<p>But the sound was faster than my steps.</p>
<p>Even though I retreated to the point where the sound wave weakened, it felt like I was getting a concussion the moment I got hit. I felt sick to my stomach and felt nauseous. In the distance, I saw two Ancient Nagaks swaying.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World' is activated!]</p>
<p>This time, Ways of Survival was activated just in time.</p>
<p>「"There’s an easy way to hunt ancient nagak."」</p>
<p>Those were the words of Yoo Joonghyuk, without a doubt, another sentence of 'Ways of Survival' came to mind next.</p>
<p>「"You can't avoid his ensemble attack even if you cover your ears."」</p>
<p>I already know. I just had my ears covered.</p>
<p>「"The attack method is simple."」</p>
<p>As expected, our regressor protagonist seemed to know the strategy of hunting an 'Ancient Nagak'.</p>
<p>「"Just before he opens his mouth for an ensemble."」</p>
<p>Before opening its mouth?</p>
<p>「"Run faster than the speed of sound and cut it in half with a powerful punch."」</p>
<p>Did I hear it wrong?</p>
<p>I rolled on the floor mindlessly avoiding the 'Nagak’s Ensemble'.</p>
<p>「"There is an easier way."」</p>
<p>Fortunately, that was not the end of Yoo Joonghyuk’s words.</p>
<p>「"All you have to do is hit its shell with the [Pacheonbuk Fist] that has reached its climax. No matter how hard the shell is, it can't handle the impact of the mesosphere."」</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk’s unlucky smile came to life before my eyes.</p>
<p>「"It’s a basic strategy that anyone can do."」</p>
<p>I can understand why Kim Dokja hit Yoo Joonghyuk in the back of the head at every opportunity.</p>
<p>When I came to my senses, I was surrounded by miniature Nagaks.</p>
<p>There is no place to avoid the next attack.</p>
<p>In the distance, the second ensemble of 'Ancient Nagak' was about to begin.</p>
<p>What should i do?</p>
<p>Can I use the 'Shield of Hercules'? [Air Area Defense] works against sword attacks. Can I defend?</p>
<p>Or not-</p>
<p>"This way."</p>
<p>A human voice came from somewhere.</p>
<p>When I turned my head, a small hand was fidgeting between the shells of the 'Nagak' from a few steps away.</p>
<p>The owner of the hand raised the shell while walking, and poked her head out through a small gap.</p>
<p>"Here. Come in here."</p>
<p>The moment I checked the child's face, I felt like my heart stopped.</p>
<p>Why is this child here?</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk’s voice echoed in my head.</p>
<p>「"Of course, I don’t bother to get my hands dirty hunting something like 'Nagaks'."」</p>
<p>In the distance, the ancient trumpets of horns resounded, and the wind blew the wavy hair of the child.</p>
<p>Brilliant light brown hair.</p>
<p>It was a child I knew well.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi."</p>
<p>The fifth member of &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; I met.</p>
<p>The first incarnation of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p>"Quickly. Come in!"</p>
<p>A child who will go through the most terrible things in this 41st turn.</p>
<p>An incarnation that finally becomes a disaster in another world line.</p>
<p>「"Take care of it, Beast Lord."」</p>
<p>Disaster of Floods—Shin Yoosoung was there.</p>
