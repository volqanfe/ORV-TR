<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">659 Episode 19 Reader (1)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>I didn't plan to use [Incite] from the beginning.</p>
<p>If ahjussi’s reason still remained, I intended to use [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] to stop him somehow.</p>
<p>"I won't kill you! I won't kill you!"</p>
<p>Dansu ahjussi, who could be seen from afar, repeated the same words as if screaming.</p>
<p>Even though I knew it wouldn't work, I shouted again.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi! Calm down!"</p>
<p>I managed to find the location of Dansu ahjussi using [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint], but that was it.</p>
<p>My [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] could see the world through that person's eyes and read their memories, but I couldn't empathize with that person.</p>
<p>「Is it because my understanding of him is not enough?」</p>
<p>A man who has lived his entire life for his daughter.</p>
<p>A man who lost his wife and fell ill himself.</p>
<p>Now I understand why the man was wearing a hospital gown at the last 'banquet'.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was the last appearance of Dansu ahjussi before he was possessed.</p>
<p>"Dansu ahjussi! I'm Cheon Inho."</p>
<p>I had to stop Dansu ahjussi somehow. However, ahjussi had already absorbed the five star jewels and was in the 5th stage of madness.</p>
<p>Aaaaaang!</p>
<p>The labyrinth vibrated violently. Killer King, who was watching the situation from the side, said a word.</p>
<p>"What great physical abilities. If you get close, you'll be crushed to the bone."</p>
<p>The incarnations brushed by ahjussi’s fist swung and splattered blood.</p>
<p>"Are you going to do it anyway?"</p>
<p>"I have to."</p>
<p>However, the road to ahjussi did not seem easy.</p>
<p>The reason was that the provocative fire flute I used attracted not only Dansu ahjussi but also others.</p>
<p>The wild beasts from all over the labyrinth are aiming for ahjussi.</p>
<p>Most of them were the embodiment of the Misreading association.</p>
<p>"It's the Misreading association."</p>
<p>Not all members of the union are from the 'Misreading association'.</p>
<p>"Kill the Misreading association."</p>
<p>I was about to ask if there was even a radar in the back, but something like a small hal protruded from Killer King's arm. A bow gun with a black sheen.</p>
<p>Even looking at it, it was an S-class item.</p>
<p>Shush shush.</p>
<p>Every time an arrow is fired, an incarnation is knocked down as it runs out in the passageway.</p>
<p>Given the high level of fire rate and accuracy, [Improved fire rate] and [Improved aiming power] were used.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that it was an item with this dwelling place.</p>
<p>The incarnations who were hit by the arrows that flew in rapid succession groaned and screamed.</p>
<p>"The second apostle."</p>
<p>The name of Killer King was called everywhere, as if he had already become a celebrity there.</p>
<p>[A small number of constellations pay attention to 'Incarnation Kang Ilhun'.]</p>
<p>Who would have known that extra Kang Ilhun would become this strong?</p>
<p>Maybe it's because he's attracted the attention of the constellations, but his expression is strangely excited.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you the little ones."</p>
<p>"Catch the second apostle first."</p>
<p>As if they thought the Killer King's existence was threatening, the incarnations of the Alliance started running toward it all at once.</p>
<p>Killer King did not panic and invoked the holy spirit.</p>
<p>A red mist rolls over his whole body.</p>
<p>I immediately recognized what the Holy Spirit was.</p>
<p>Great Warrior Jophiel's '503 Unit'.</p>
<p>When Killer King drew the bowstring, the roasted mist wrapped around the tip of the arrow as if it were alive.</p>
<p>"Everybody, die."</p>
<p>The arrow flew like a shot and caused a dust explosion when it hit the target.</p>
<p>The elites of the '503 Corps', who bounced in all directions like a grenade burst, pierced five or six incarnations nearby at breakneck speed and turned them into beehives.</p>
<p>"Uh. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p>Frightened, several of members of the union fell.</p>
<p>I hate to admit it, but it was a great sight.</p>
<p>The way he speaks is like Kim Namwoon, but his skills are astonishing even to Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>Killer King nodded his head with an inexplicable smile, as if he had read my eyes.</p>
<p>"Go. Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>"I’m not."</p>
<p>"I believe."</p>
<p>I don't know what you're talking about, but it seemed like this was the only chance.</p>
<p>As I ran to the floor, Literature Girl 64 followed my steps.</p>
<p>"It's a game my brother often plays."</p>
<p>"I know roughly."</p>
<p>Just like Yoo Joonghyuk and Kim Dokja formed a duo in the main story, let's fight together.</p>
<p>"Then what is Yerin’s role?"</p>
<p>"It changes every time."</p>
<p>Literature Girl 64 added while blowing away one of the incarnations that rushed at her with her elegant feet.</p>
<p>"Isn’t it Han Sooyoung now?"</p>
<p>Kim Dokja, Yoo Joonghyuk, and Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if the people here right now were the real them?</p>
<p>[A constellation that has not yet revealed their modifier is watching you.]</p>
<p>If they had turned the impossible into possible, they would have found a way to save Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<p>"Yerin-ssi."</p>
<p>At my words, Literature Girl 64 nodded her head.</p>
<p>An incarnation of powerful energy could be seen right in front of Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<p>The brightly shining Dustman was definitely different from those of other incarnations.</p>
<p>"It's the king."</p>
<p>"I will take care of it."</p>
<p>[Incarnation 'Lee Seyeon' activates 'battle action mode'!]</p>
<p>Literature Girl 64's main skill, which is to enter a command and unfold a continuous skill, was displayed.</p>
<p>However, the king's actions were a little faster.</p>
<p>"Get out of the way everyone!"</p>
<p>I have to stop it somehow.</p>
<p>However, the passage was once again blocked by the members of the union that came from the side passage.</p>
<p>Killer King's support shots, which flew in from time to time, were also gradually delayed.</p>
<p>It was because of the appearance of long-distance power over there.</p>
<p>"Shoot!"</p>
<p>Troops of arrows holding each bow were lined up on the other side of the aisle.</p>
<p>I reflexively swung my sword while supplying magic power to the broken faith.</p>
<p>['Blade of Faith' is activated!]</p>
<p>I barely managed to remove the single arrows, but the destructive power of each arrow was heavy.</p>
<p>It seemed that there was an incarnation with specialized archery skills.</p>
<p>Can I break through?</p>
<p>It wasn't impossible if [Incite] was used.</p>
<p>Like when dealing with the ark of the Beggar Sect, if I borrow the power of Kyrgios, I can break through the arrows and reach Dansu ahjussi’s nose at once.</p>
<p>The problem was then.</p>
<p>When I have already exhausted my strength with [Strengthen Sentence], will I still have the energy to stop Dansu ahjussi?</p>
<p>It was then that I got a message from the group chat in my ear.</p>
<p>—Ahjussi, get down.</p>
<p>I reflexively grabbed Literature Girl 64 by the shoulder and made her get down.</p>
<p>Looking back, I saw Shin Yoosoung touching the ground with her palm. At the same time, portals swayed in the maze.</p>
<p>[Monster Gate.]</p>
<p>I was surprised.</p>
<p>Was Shin Yoosoung able to open the gate at this point?</p>
<p>Beyond the gate, dozens of Nagaks, who had been tamed by Shin Yoosoung, were creeping over.</p>
<p>"What, what! Where did you appear from?!"</p>
<p>The incarnations shot arrows toward the monsters in the air.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone by them, the Nagaks with their mouths wide open began to sing in chorus.</p>
<p>[Nagak Ensemble.]</p>
<p>Even that mighty strong king got thrown in the air and stuck in a stupid place by the bombardment of the pouring sonic waves.</p>
<p>While the surprised incarnations wandered around, Shin Yoosoung's voice was heard.</p>
<p>—Go, ahjussi.</p>
<p>Light sparks flew from the body of Shin Yoosoung, who was manipulating the Nagaks.</p>
<p>—You said he was close to you.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung's golden eyes flickered. The eyes of a child who is looking at me but not looking at me at the same time.</p>
<p>—You must never die.</p>
<p>I ran while infusing [Broken Faith] with the [White and Blue Steel]. Cutting off the limbs of the incarnations with the new soldier's blade, I ran towards ahjussi.</p>
<p>"Okay, throw it! Feed him another one!"</p>
<p>But they were faster than me.</p>
<p>The star jewel that flew through the air reached the dust man of Dansu ahjussi. With a whimpering sound, ahjussi’s whole body began to flatten once again.</p>
<p>[Incarnation 'Lee Dansu' acquired 1 additional Star Jewel'!]</p>
<p>[A total of 6 star jewels have been acquired.]</p>
<p>[Incarnation 'Lee Dansu' enters 'Madness Stage 6'.]</p>
<p>"Yerin!"</p>
<p>The moment the king opened his eyes and turned around, Literature Girl 64's weave hit the boy's face.</p>
<p>I didn't let go of his back and arrived right in front of Dansu ahjussi's nose.</p>
<p>Once again, the giant Dansu let out a painful groan.</p>
<p>Tears flowed non-stop from the old man's eyes.</p>
<p>Now, just by going near Dansu ahjussi, I felt creepy.</p>
<p>An alarm bell rang in my head.</p>
<p>Was this how I felt when I first met Yoo Joonghyuk in the 41st round?</p>
<p>I know how to feel when faced with a different species with different physical abilities.</p>
<p>[The overall stats of 'Incarnation Cheon Inho' have exceeded the scenario limits.]</p>
<p>[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint is not deterred. There is no chance of winning in a head-to-head fight.]</p>
<p>「There is only one way left.」</p>
<p>I didn't want to write this way.</p>
<p>"I won't kill you. I won't kill you."</p>
<p>The old man held out his hand towards me. It was in slow motion, so I could have avoided it if I wanted to.</p>
<p>But I didn't escape.</p>
<p>So to speak, this.</p>
<p>"I will kill you."</p>
<p>It was my small atonement for Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<p>My one arm twisted with a groaning sound.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.9' is activated!]</p>
<p>[I am Yoo Joonghyuk.]</p>
<p>As the steel-like sensation of Yoo Joonghyuk penetrated into my brain, I was able to barely keep my senses even in the distant pain.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi. I don't want to do this either. But."</p>
<p>He looked at me as if he was really listening to me.</p>
<p>"I'll fool you just once."</p>
<p>I breathed in as hard as I could to contain the pain.</p>
<p>"I am."</p>
<p>This is a lie that shouldn't be.</p>
<p>Even so, this was the only way to save Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<p>"I am Noh Jiyoon."</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Incitement Lv. 9' is activated!]</p>
<p>At the same time, ahjussi moved a few times.</p>
<p>The face of the old man with black bloody tears was fixed on me.</p>
<p>The man who can't see anything.</p>
<p>Even so, at this moment, Dansu ahjussi was looking at a certain scenery.</p>
<p>In this world, a scenery that only you and me can see.</p>
<p>「There was a girl there. Small stature with a round face. Eyebrows slightly more open than others. Plump cheeks that haven’t lost all of their meat.」</p>
<p>Dansu ahjussi's cheek muscles moved and the corners of his mouth twitched slowly. In these spasms of subtle emotions, I read the old man's heart in it.</p>
<p>"Pass the star jewel to me."</p>
<p>In this Star Labyrinth, there are a total of two ways to steal someone else's Bell Powder.</p>
<p>One is to become the same group and unify 'Dustman'.</p>
<p>The second is to kill others to get star dust from the dust surface.</p>
<p>But as I guessed, those two methods are not the only ones.</p>
<p>If that were all, other 'kings' would not be able to throw star jewels at Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<p>My guess is this.</p>
<p>If [Dust] is made into a 'Star Jewel', the 'Star Jewel' will become tradeable!</p>
<p>Burrr.</p>
<p>The dust side of Dansu ahjussi in the air is painful.</p>
<p>He shuddered as if he was embarrassed, and soon he made a profit with a wok.</p>
<p>A piece of shiny five-colored stone.</p>
<p>It was a star jewel.</p>
<p>Ahjussi handed me a star jewel like someone would give his daughter his birthday present.</p>
<p>"Ji… yoon… ah."</p>
<p>[You have acquired 1 'Star Jewel'.]</p>
<p>[Entering 'Madness Stage 1'.]</p>
<p>The dustman that was standing above my head ate the star jewel as if it had been waiting for it.</p>
<p>The operation was successful.</p>
<p>The incarnations of the Union, who had been paying attention to the surroundings, were agitated.</p>
<p>If they risk their lives right now, it could be dangerous for both me and Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<p>But as I expected, they wouldn't move.</p>
<p>"Um, that bastard is going through the star jewels?"</p>
<p>"It's okay. Leave it alone."</p>
<p>"It's like he’s indulging in his own greed."</p>
<p>Also, I knew that.</p>
<p>Their goal is the 'death sword'.</p>
<p>It didn't matter to them who collected the 7 star jewels.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>8. Every time you acquire 1 'Star Jewel', the 'Madness' value increases.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>They clearly understood the 8th rule of the Star Labyrinth.</p>
<p>Due to the 'Madness Penalty', no one can collect '7 Star Jewels' while remaining sane in this labyrinth.</p>
<p>So, it would be their plan to collect 7 star jewels for the sacrificial lamb and take only the summoned death sword.</p>
<p>"Ha ha ha! Eat a lot!"</p>
<p>The ruse was noticed early on.</p>
<p>If this continues, I will become a madman like you.</p>
<p>[Entering 'Madness Stage 2'.]</p>
<p>Every time I acquired a star jewel, I felt my body change.</p>
<p>The overall concentration increased explosively, and the cohesion increased in real time. The dragon's blood vessels cut with a special sound.</p>
<p>[Entering 'Madness Stage 3']</p>
<p>There is a feeling that the volume of the brain is expanding to a size that the skull cannot handle.</p>
<p>But I bit my lip and held on.</p>
<p>I can do it.</p>
<p>I also have equipment with strong anti-magic abilities, and most of all, I have [Incite].</p>
<p>So I was confident.</p>
<p>Even if I fell into madness, I would be able to endure it.</p>
<p>Without losing my sanity, I will be able to collect 7 star jewels, summon the Death Sword, and destroy the absolute throne.</p>
<p>「There is no Kim Dokja in this world.」</p>
<p>That's why I have to.</p>
<p>Only I can block the aspirations of this world.</p>
<p>I saw Killer King and Shin Yoosoung shouting at me from afar.</p>
<p>I smiled at them as a sign that I was okay.</p>
<p>[You have acquired 5 star jewels.]</p>
<p>[Entering Madness Stage 5.]</p>
<p>It was dangerous. My eyes hurt as if they would burst, and my vision was stained red.</p>
<p>The hold of reason in my head was weakening.</p>
<p>Now, Dansu ahjussi's overall ability was much weaker than before. I released 'Noh Jiyoon''s [Incite] and showed my final concentration.</p>
<p>What I need now is someone who can withstand this terrible madness.</p>
<p>There were candidates that came to mind.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, Jung Heewon, Han Sooyoung, and Lee Hyunsung.</p>
<p>But it didn't seem like they could easily endure this madness.</p>
<p>Now, I needed a person with 'strong mental strength'.</p>
<p>And no matter how much I thought about it, there was only one such person.</p>
<p>A man who has loved only one story for over ten years.</p>
<p>Even after dying several times, he is the main character who never gave up on the ending he wanted.</p>
<p>"I am Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>This is something only Kim Dokja can do.</p>
<p>It was then that an unknown sentence popped up in front of me.</p>
<p>「At that moment, Lee Hakhyun did not know.」</p>
<p>A sentence that comes to mind without a chance to react. It was a phrase I had seen somewhere before.</p>
<p>「The fact that he will never be able to go back to the way he was before.」</p>
<p>The moment I intuited that something was wrong and hurriedly canceled the skill.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.9' is activated!]</p>
<p>I heard something breaking inside me.</p>
