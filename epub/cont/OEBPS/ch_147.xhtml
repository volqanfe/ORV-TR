<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">699 Episode 25 Demon King (2)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>As if he had been waiting for him, the demon noble calmly turned toward the entrance of the Capitol.</p>
<p>But Yoo Joonghyuk did not move a single step. His past lives were talking to him.</p>
<p>That's a trap.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn't a trap, he didn't believe anything the Demon King's liaison said.</p>
<p>"Prophet."</p>
<p>Anna Croft had no answer to Yoo Joonghyuk's call.</p>
<p>When he glanced over, she saw Anna Croft staggering around, her complexion pale.</p>
<p>"I don’t know why, but [Future Sight] doesn’t work."</p>
<p>[Future Sight doesn’t work. Even in his last round, Anna Croft's skills often broke down.]</p>
<p>But it was such an odd timing.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk analyzed Anna Croft's condition with calm eyes and made a quick decision.</p>
<p>"You’re useless whenever it’s important."</p>
<p>Before he knew it, the demon noble was more than twenty steps away.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk had already obtained information about this guy through [Sage's Eyes].</p>
<p>'It's Viscount Nikhteri the Devil.'</p>
<p>This guy was a 'self-made devil'.</p>
<p>Based on the original scenario difficulty, this guy should only appear in the eighth scenario.</p>
<p>That guy said, 'The Demon King of Salvation is waiting'.</p>
<p>Inside the Capitol, there is a real agent of the 'Demon King'.</p>
<p>Probably, the probability that there is an incarnation capable of being possessed by the Demon King is higher than the possibility that there is a symbolic body.</p>
<p>In that case, he must be considered to be at least an earl-level Demon King.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk took a deep breath. With each breath, the magical power condensed in his entire body continued to rotate.</p>
<p>In general, 'Iljucheon' refers to the circulation of the magic power contained in the Danjeon to all microscopic blood vessels.</p>
<p>However, with his master, 'Iljucheon' was used with a different meaning.</p>
<p>Only when the circulating magic draws a complete circle does the body become an eye in itself.</p>
<p>Eyes that perceive the world through expanded five senses.</p>
<p>Through those eyes, humans see the sky. You realize that the sky, which seemed beautiful and wide, was actually a prison in a terrible scenario.</p>
<p>「"In fact, it is to recognize that this whole world is just a joke in the sky. That is Iljucheon, the entrance to Pacheon."」</p>
<p>At this point, it was still difficult to count the stars in the sky. However, it was not difficult to count the demon species on earth.</p>
<p>"A total of four?"</p>
<p>Shocked, Viscount Nihterida looked back.</p>
<p>Next, three stone statues radiated a gloomy light from above the stone building of the Capitol.</p>
<p>[The evil Viscount 'Bricolakas' is hostile towards you.]</p>
<p>[The evil Viscount 'Scupedia' is showing hostility towards you.]</p>
<p>[The evil Viscount 'Myrmicoleon' shows his hostility towards you.]</p>
<p>As many as four demon viscounts.</p>
<p>In no round did he face four self-made demons at the same time in the seventh scenario.</p>
<p>Coo coo coo coo coo.</p>
<p>Anna Croft bit her lip as she felt the pressure of the demonic species pressing down on the area.</p>
<p>"They are the demons who killed my comrades."</p>
<p>Perhaps these demons were summoned in the fifth scenario. Starting from only the fifth scenario, it was obvious that no country could handle this level of difficulty.</p>
<p>As Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes gave off a sharp light, the viscounts looked at each other as if they were curious.</p>
<p>Coo coo coo coo.</p>
<p>If it had been the previous round, or if it had been the round even before, Yoo Joonghyuk would never have confronted them. Fighting with four viscount-level fighters in the seventh scenario is tantamount to suicide.</p>
<p>But Yoo Joonghyuk did not back down. Because this round was neither the 39th nor the 40th.</p>
<p>This world is the 41st round.</p>
<p>The moment Yoo Joonghyuk's body disappeared, the three Viscounts simultaneously drew their weapons towards Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>Brycolakas held the long incense stick that was his main weapon, Scoupedia held the dual-wielding daggers, and Myrmicleon held the swollen drumstick.</p>
<p>Magical energy containing deep evil karma burst out in a semicircle around the three demons.</p>
<p>At that moment , Yoo Joonghyuk's agility had reached the limit of the scenario. However, in the eyes of the demonic viscounts, it was a speed that wasn’t desirable.</p>
<p>The viscounts' eyes were simultaneously nailed to a single point in the air.</p>
<p>"Is it there?"</p>
<p>The spear, dual-wielding daggers, and the drumstick struck a point in the air at the same time. The demonic viscounts laughed along with a cruel explosion sound. They thought Yoo Joonghyuk would have been crushed mercilessly.</p>
<p>However, when the black ether that dyed the air black disappeared, Yoo Joonghyuk was not there.</p>
<p>"What—"</p>
<p>That couldn't have been possible. There was no way just one incarnation could avoid the eyes of a demon noble who had evolved.</p>
<p>The moment when the demon Viscount Myrmicoleon sensed something was wrong, he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>Skag.</p>
<p>With a sound as if the world was splitting in two, the head of Demon Viscount Myrmicoleon was blown off.</p>
<p>For the first time, agitation spread across the demons' faces.</p>
<p>Let's say he’s just out of their sight. However, a viscount-level demon was killed in one blow.</p>
<p>"It does not make sense—"</p>
<p>But to the current Yoo Joonghyuk, it 'made sense'. The power he now manifests was obtained at a high price.</p>
<p>['Restraint of Truth' is activated.]</p>
<p>One of his three story imprints, 'The Redemption of Truth'.</p>
<p>[Some of your memories are sealed.]</p>
<p>'Story Engraving' that unleashes power in exchange for some of the memories from the previous round being sealed.</p>
<p>[All your overall abilities will temporarily exceed the scenario limit!]</p>
<p>[Explosive power surges from your entire body!]</p>
<p>In Yoo Joonghyuk's mind, a memory he cherished was fading away. It was a memory he dedicated.</p>
<p>「"Captain. This is a birthday present. It's my favorite toshi..."」</p>
<p>Lee Hyunsung in the 22nd round, smiling with a simple face. The old toshi he handed him was disappearing from his mind. The temperature of his heart decreased and his heart became infinitely cold.</p>
<p>Perhaps Yoo Joonghyuk will never remember that smile again. Instead, Yoo Joonghyuk will remember something else.</p>
<p>His long journey of regression has finally come to an end, a memory that will not disappear until the end of his life.</p>
<p>「"Captain. Will you please take revenge in the next round?"」</p>
<p>"I will grant your wish, Lee Hyunsung."</p>
<p>He will remember only sorrow.</p>
<p>I will fight against the sky of this world using the hatred born of that sadness as my driving force.</p>
<p>"You! How dare you!"</p>
<p>The demonic Viscount Scoupedia charged at him, brandishing his dual daggers. The pitch-black river that formed at the end of his weapons streaked Yoo Joonghyuk's cheek.</p>
<p>But even faster than that, Yoo Joonghyuk had already pierced Scoupedia's heart.</p>
<p>Deep.</p>
<p>Scoupedia, who vomited black blood, died. Vrycolakas and Nihterida, enraged, joined forces and rushed forward.</p>
<p>It was an attack prepared to defeat Donggui.</p>
<p>The Ammu created by Nihterida covered the field of vision, and Vrykolakas' long spear split into a dozen pieces and flew in from all directions. Several polearms grazed Yoo Joonghyuk's thighs and waist.</p>
<p>Skag.</p>
<p>Vricolakas' head fell.</p>
<p>Now all that remained was the demonic Viscount Nihterida.</p>
<p>Nihterida, who hesitated and retreated, said,</p>
<p>"What are you doing? Why are you opposing us? The Demon King has no hostility towards you!"</p>
<p>Nihterida, who had even thrown away his pride as a demon species, shouted in a panic.</p>
<p>"Hmm, why would you do something like this? The 'Demon King of Salvation' will definitely be fine if you call him."</p>
<p>Nihterida, realizing that the situation was unfavorable, looked at him then quickly turned back and began to run away.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Suzaku Shinbo Lv.10' is activated!]</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's thigh muscles wriggled like an animal once again. His footsteps pushed into the ground deeply with a loud noise. Yoo Joonghyuk concentrated his magic power by spinning it around in the air. [Pacheon Ganggi], which extended toward the sky with its centrifugal force.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Flashlight Lv.8' is activated!]</p>
<p>The magic power gathered turned into holy light and created a large hole in Nihterida's upper body.</p>
<p>['Redemption of Truth' ends.]</p>
<p>As soon as his magic power was exhausted, Yoo Joonghyuk took out the 'Advanced Magic Power Recovery Potion' from his arms and drank it.</p>
<p>The liquid that fell seeped into his entire body.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk lightly wiped his mouth with a somewhat tired expression then immediately looked at the equipment items dropped by the demon species.</p>
<p>'Ancient demon's necklace.'</p>
<p>'Half armor of great strength.'</p>
<p>'Ammu Belt.'</p>
<p>All three were not bad pieces of equipment.</p>
<p>The 'half armor of great strength', which increased strength, was suitable for Lee Hyunsung, whose main focus is hand-to-hand combat, and the 'ammu belt' was suitable for Yoo Joonghyuk himself to wear.</p>
<p>'I guess I can give this to him.'</p>
<p>The 'Ancient Demon's Necklace', which increases stun resistance, was for the guy who fainted frequently.</p>
<p>It's useless in its current state, so filling it in would be of some help.</p>
<p>Anna asked in bewilderment as she saw Yoo Joonghyuk standing up after finishing maintenance in an instant.</p>
<p>"What on earth did you do?"</p>
<p>"There is no part for you. You didn’t help in the battle."</p>
<p>"That’s not what I’m talking about."</p>
<p>In fact, Yoo Joonghyuk knew what had surprised Anna Croft.</p>
<p>He was incredible. The level of prowess he had just shown was incomparable to any incarnation of the same scenario.</p>
<p>"Did you really make a 'story imprint'? Have you forgotten what the villains who used it said?"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk also knew the fate of those 'villains'. Some of them had their existence sealed because they could not find a way to get rid of it.</p>
<p>"It’s about borrowing and writing a fictional 'story'. Its power will eat away at your soul and memories."</p>
<p>"It’s none of your business."</p>
<p>"What have you lost in return?"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk did not answer, but Anna Croft knew what he had lost.</p>
<p>「"Prophet. There is a necessary memory. Use [Future Sight]."」</p>
<p>To a regressor, 'memory' is everything to existence.</p>
<p>"Why did you do that... Sealed memories don’t come back! Now you’ve lost them forever. Do you even know what that means?"</p>
<p>The disappeared worlds exist only through his memories, and he also maintains his identity by not forgetting those memories.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk gave his memories in return.</p>
<p>"You will end up becoming someone else. You will not even know who you are."</p>
<p>"You talk like you know who you are."</p>
<p>As if any further conversation was meaningless, Yoo Joonghyuk began to walk away again. There were traces of the demons' blood in each of his footprints.</p>
<p>Anna Croft stared blankly at the footprints he left behind.</p>
<p>If he fails, what meaning will these footprints have?</p>
<p>If there ever comes a moment when even she gives up reading her past with [Future Sight], then who will remember that long record of failures of that regressor?</p>
<p>Should she make it difficult?</p>
<p>"Wait a minute. Wait, King!"</p>
<p>Anna Croft, who belatedly woke up from her thoughts, quickly followed Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>However, before he could walk even a short distance, Yoo Joonghyuk suddenly stopped walking. She didn't need to ask what was going on. This is because he saw someone walking out from inside the Capitol.</p>
<p>A formidable magical energy that made his whole body tremble.</p>
<p>"Run, Prophet."</p>
<p>For the first time, Yoo Joonghyuk's expression hardened.</p>
<p>"It’s a 'Marquis' level demon."</p>
<hr/>
<p>That's where Anna Croft's story ended.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute. So what happened?"</p>
<p>Wasn't some important information missing?</p>
<p>What happened to Yoo Joonghyuk, who fought a marquis-level demon?</p>
<p>If something like that happens, how can you be sure that your companions will be safe?</p>
<p>So who is the 'Demon King of Salvation' over there?</p>
<p>In the end, I couldn't bear it anymore and insisted.</p>
<p>"Could it be that you threw Yoo Joonghyuk there and ran away alone?"</p>
<p>"Before we continue, there’s something I need to ask you."</p>
<p>I already knew what Anna Croft would 'ask'.</p>
<p>In the first place, she started this story to earn time.</p>
<p>The incarnations surrounding the outside of the living room from earlier were proof of this.</p>
<p>Of course, no matter how many incarnations surrounded this place, it wasn't a big threat to me. That is, as long as the combat power of the incarnations is within the realm of probability.</p>
<p>"We have 'tactical nuclear weapons'."</p>
<p>"So?"</p>
<p>Tactical nuclear weapon. It seemed like they had managed to secure modern weapons from the generation before the scenario.</p>
<p>"You’re not planning on flying that thing at the Washington Dome, are you? You know there’s no point in doing something like that."</p>
<p>A nuclear weapon with that level of destructive power cannot be activated due to the scenario structure.</p>
<p>Perhaps the moment the launch button is pressed against the Washington Dome, the nuclear weapon will stop operating due to the probability aftereffects.</p>
<p>But now, instead of launching a tactical nuclear weapon at the Washington Dome, she brought that weapon to me.</p>
<p>"I heard from Christina that you are a 'family member' of the Demon King."</p>
<p>Perhaps Anna Croft had made up her mind. If necessary, she will use that 'nuclear weapon' here.</p>
<p>"Is the name of the Demon King you serve 'Demon King of Salvation'?"</p>
