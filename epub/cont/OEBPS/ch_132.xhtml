<hr/>
<p>At first, of course I thought it was a joke.</p>
<p>—Hit Yoo Joonghyuk in the back of the head.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>Because no sane person would make such a suggestion.</p>
<p>—Then I will help you.</p>
<p>No, seriously?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>—Because I miss it.</p>
<p>"Why do you want to see that?"</p>
<p>It was a difficult question to ask.</p>
<p>I guess he said he wanted to see it because it was fun. The 'Demon King of Salvation' is a constellation after all.</p>
<p>No, before he was a constellation, that person actually liked hitting Yoo Joonghyuk in the back of the head.</p>
<p>Not only in the 3rd round, but also in the 1,863rd round, he was a heinous great man who hit Yoo Joonghyuk on the back of the head and made him eat dirt.</p>
<p>If you think about it, it was a strange thing.</p>
<p>Why did Kim Dokja do such a thing?</p>
<p>Is he naturally a bit sadistic?</p>
<p>—Why? Can't you do it? Did you ask for help without that much courage?</p>
<p>"No, being courageous and being crazy are different."</p>
<p>—If you can’t do it, quit. You don't need my help, right?</p>
<p>"No! I need it! I need it!"</p>
<p>I calmed down and thought about this proposal again.</p>
<p>If you think about it, Kim Dokja’s actions were thoroughly calculated throughout the scenarios.</p>
<p>From an item picked up during a scenario to a paving stone laid in advance, Kim Dokja was the person who prepared for the very distant future.</p>
<p>That guy told me to hit Yoo Joonghyuk in the back of the head.</p>
<p>If so, there must be a reason.</p>
<p>Tak!</p>
<p>I believed so. Until I heard a clicking sound from my palm.</p>
<p>The moment my eyes met with Yoo Joonghyuk’s, who slowly turned his head. I realized what I had done.</p>
<p>A terrifying look that seems to freeze even your heart. Pupils glowing with terrible heat glared at me.</p>
<p>First of all, to make the facts clear, I did not properly hit Yoo Joonghyuk in the back of the head.</p>
<p>To be exact, I just hit the magic barrier between the back of Yoo Joonghyuk's head and my palm.</p>
<p>[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'’s skill 'Self-Defense Lv.10' is being activated.]</p>
<p>In the seventh scenario, the self-defense level is as high as level 10.</p>
<p>This was an opponent on whom an attack from the back of the head would not work.</p>
<p>'What should I do now?'</p>
<p>Anyway, I kept my promise to Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>From now on, it’s up to Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>—You really did this.</p>
<p>'Yes?'</p>
<p>—I didn't know you would really do it.</p>
<p>Are you crazy?</p>
<p>Lately, another piece of information about Kim Dokja came to mind.</p>
<p>Clearly, Kim Dokja plans everything thoroughly.</p>
<p>However, did this person have a plan when he hit Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>My spine straightened and my spine went numb. It became clear to me that if this continued, I would die.</p>
<p>What on earth have I done?</p>
<p>Why did I hit Yoo Joonghyuk in the back of the head?</p>
<p>To the guy who already has a grudge against me-</p>
<p>[Exclusive characteristics are activated!]</p>
<p>Is it because I was in danger? Suddenly, my head became clear and my mind became clearer.</p>
<p>This became clear.</p>
<p>Let's live. I have to survive somehow.</p>
<p>To Yoo Joonghyuk, I am now Cheon Inho.</p>
<p>If I were Cheon Inho, what would I say to Yoo Joonghyuk now?</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.10' is activated!]</p>
<p>Equipped with the special Cheon Inho mode, my narrowed eyes twirled in a gentle arc.</p>
<p>"Your skill proficiency is amazing. I wouldn’t have been able to stop you in my last life."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's expression, who had been rolling his eyes at my shameless tone, changed completely.</p>
<p>"Did you regain your memories from the last round?"</p>
<p>I just shrugged my shoulders without answering. However, Yoo Joonghyuk’s answer was unexpected.</p>
<p>"Stop acting. I already know that you are not 'Cheon Inho'."</p>
<p>I swallowed my embarrassment.</p>
<p>I knew that Yoo Joonghyuk was suspicious of me.</p>
<p>But I never thought he would bring that up out loud.</p>
<p>"Why do you think that?"</p>
<p>"If you were really Cheon Inho, you would have aimed for a more obvious vital point."</p>
<p>"Then let’s use the fake Cheon Inho. After all, who I am doesn't matter, right?"</p>
<p>"It wasn’t important. Originally."</p>
<p>With those words, Yoo Joonghyuk put on his coat.</p>
<p>After that, he sat down on a chair and started gulping down the drink on the table. Even as he drank his drink, he did not take his eyes off the clear sky outside the window.</p>
<p>I could see what Yoo Joonghyuk was looking at.</p>
<p>In the center of the cloudless sky, there remained traces as if someone had grabbed the space itself and ripped it away.</p>
<p>This was from the award ceremony 45 days ago, when the 'Great Hall' disappeared.</p>
<p>Beyond the sky, me and Yoo Joonghyuk fought Asmodeus, then I faced off against the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne'.</p>
<p>Does Yoo Joonghyuk remember what happened that day?</p>
<p>—Also.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja, who was watching Yoo Joonghyuk with me, said.</p>
<p>—He’s not killing you.</p>
<p>I was dumbfounded. Did he make me hit the head of Yoo Joonghyuk just to test it?</p>
<p>—You've learned that he won't kill you anyway. This is important. I don't know how many more times I'm going to have to hit that guy in the back of the head from now on.</p>
<p>'I won't hit him anymore.'</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, who must have sensed my gaze, put down his glass and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"Fake Cheon Inho."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Why did you stop me from taking the Absolute Throne?"</p>
<p>"You took it in the end."</p>
<p>"I know what you did."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's whole body slowly looked back at me, showing the power of a king.</p>
<p>But that was only a matter of momentum, and it didn't actually have any influence on me.</p>
<p>In this round, it was proof that the 'Absolute Throne' was not functioning properly.</p>
<p>"How did you kill the 'God of Another World'?"</p>
<p>"I was lucky."</p>
<p>"Why on earth did you do that?"</p>
<p>"You will never see a proper ending if you take the throne."</p>
<p>"How do you know that?"</p>
<p>"You’re a regressor and you still don’t know that?"</p>
<p>In the meantime, did the 'Demon King of Salvation' Kim Dokja's tone of voice change? Without realizing it, I came up with a sharp answer.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk’s reaction was clear.</p>
<p>"You."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk acted as if he was going to kill him this time.</p>
<p>I started gulping on my saliva without realizing it.</p>
<p>—Don’t be scared. He won’t kill you.</p>
<p>I also agreed with what Kim Dokja said.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk can't kill me now.</p>
<p>In fact, Yoo Joonghyuk's murderous spirit, who was glaring at me, slowly subsided. Yoo Joonghyuk made his decision.</p>
<p>Rather than killing me here and now. It's better to use me.</p>
<p>—It's not a very bad situation. You have been recognized by Joonghyuk, right?</p>
<p>Recognized by Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>That sounds like I haven't lived very wrongly.</p>
<p>I didn't feel bad inside.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk continued speaking.</p>
<p>"That day, there was someone other than you who stopped me."</p>
<p>I could immediately tell who Yoo Joonghyuk was talking about.</p>
<p>That was a story about Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p>"She planted a memory in my head."</p>
<p>"What memory?"</p>
<p>"A memory from another world line."</p>
<p>Even though it was something I expected, I got goosebumps again.</p>
<p>Not another Yoo Joonghyuk, but Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st round learned about the world line of 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』.</p>
<p>I was curious about Kim Dokja's reaction, but he didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>"Do you know that world line too?"</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>I became curious for a moment.</p>
<p>How does Yoo Joonghyuk in the 41st round view the world of 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』?</p>
<p>What did he feel when he saw the story of that world?</p>
<p>"Can you do something similar to that woman?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"I’m asking if you can plant the memories of that world line in my head."</p>
<p>Like Han Sooyoung, I did not have the complete story of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.</p>
<p>But if I were to simply inject what happened in that world line, I might be able to imitate it similarly.</p>
<p>Because I have [Incite].</p>
<p>"If you turn off [mental barrier], I can do it, however clumsily. Are you curious about the story of that world line?"</p>
<p>I was worried for a moment.</p>
<p>If Yoo Joonghyuk says he wants to know that world line, should I tell him the story?</p>
<p>If that happens, what will happen to this 41st round?</p>
<p>"I’m not curious about the story."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk said that and frowned again, I wondered what he was thinking. Then he opened his mouth as if sighing lightly.</p>
<p>"I received a call from Anna Croft a little while ago."</p>
<p>It was a name I hadn’t heard in a long time.</p>
<p>Anna Croft.</p>
<p>The representative incarnation of Asgard. She is the representative of the American group.</p>
<p>"That woman’s group will join the final battle of the seventh scenario."</p>
<p>"You mean Zarathustra?"</p>
<p>"It seems like you know."</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>In fact, I had used the Specter's Stone to meet Anna Croft.</p>
<p>I had a brief conversation with her.</p>
<p>"Are you planning to join forces with her?"</p>
<p>To be honest, I was surprised.</p>
<p>I don't know what happened in the 40th round, but the Yoo Joonghyuk I know was never the type of person to join forces with 'Anna Croft'.</p>
<p>Of course, things will change when we enter the later episodes of 'Ways of Survival', but this is only the 41st round.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, who has not forgotten any of the tragedy that occurred in the last round... will he be able to cooperate with that 'Anna Croft'?</p>
<p>"If I ever meet Anna Croft, I’ll probably kill her."</p>
<p>With those words, a strange sensation arose throughout Yoo Jonhyuk's body.</p>
<p>It was a sense of an unsettling story.</p>
<p>At the same time, Kim Dokja’s voice was heard.</p>
<p>—Damn, that kid got that tattooed on his body in only the seventh scenario?</p>
<p>Kim Dokja seemed to recognize what Yoo Joonghyuk's story was.</p>
<p>"Anna Croft is still useful. She has work to do, at least until the world ends. So if I'm going to kill her..."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk took a slow breath as if to calm himself down.</p>
<p>"You should stop it."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Infuse me with memories of another world line."</p>
<p>"What… if I do something like that?"</p>
<p>"Then I can stop."</p>
<p>Goosebumps slowly appeared down my spine.</p>
<p>Only then did I start to understand why Yoo Joonghyuk kept me alive.</p>
<p>"I don’t really know why, but when I receive these memories, I stop acting."</p>
<p>「Happy memories.」</p>
<p>I don’t know what happened to Yoo Joonghyuk’s inner self after receiving his memories.</p>
<p>However, Yoo Joonghyuk was speaking.</p>
<p>"I don’t know if you are Cheon Inho or not. But you will stay next to me and stop me when I give you an order."</p>
<p>Stop him when he orders me to.</p>
<p>"That’s your usefulness."</p>
<p>I understood what Yoo Joonghyuk meant. That's why I couldn't believe it.</p>
<p>—Congratulations, youngest. Looks like this is going to work out well.</p>
<p>Just now, I was officially recognized by Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st round.</p>
<p>"This is an order. Join this scenario."</p>
<p>Become his companion to prevent the destruction of this world.</p>
<p>'Constellation.'</p>
<p>—Huh.</p>
<p>The moment when the first ray of light shone in the 41st world, which was filled with all kinds of gloomy prospects.</p>
<p>Maybe it is not too late for the 41st round. This story can still be changed.</p>
<p>As expected, Kim Dokja spoke in an even more excited voice as if he was moved.</p>
<p>—Next time you hit him in the back of the head, let’s inject a memory where I made him eat dirt.</p>
<p>I ignored Kim Dokja’s nonsense and checked my smartphone. That was because a vibration rang at that moment.</p>
<p>[A new episode of 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' has been updated on the platform.]</p>
<p>And then I realized I had forgotten I had this ability.</p>
<p>The ability to check 'comments' on episodes posted on the platform. If I used this ability, not only what happened in the last 45 days. I may also be able to get hints about future events.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I clicked on the platform app… How did this happen?</p>
<p>The series from the last 45 days in which I fainted did not exist.</p>
