<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">755 Episode 32 Monkey King (2)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>There are a total of four 'Sun Wukong' in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p>'Sun Wukong' is divided into a total of four depending on the modifier he has.</p>
<p>The first one was 'Meihouwang' who was the Monkey King of Mt. Hwagwa Mountain.</p>
<p>The second is 'Bimawen', who was the stable keeper of the heavenly world.</p>
<p>The third is 'Great Sage Heaven's Equal', whom we know (this guy is the owner of the golden headband).</p>
<p>The fourth is 'Douzhanshengfo', who attained enlightenment at the end of his journey and became Buddha.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, I felt that he was somehow similar to Kim Dokja. Because Kim Dokja’s existence was divided according to his modifier.</p>
<p>[I asked, are you Kim Dokja?]</p>
<p>"First of all, I am Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>I continued speaking while looking closely at the monkey in front of me.</p>
<p>「Dazzling golden fur. Tattered tiger skin panties. Even his unique eyes that look somewhat drowsy.」</p>
<p>It was definitely true. The monkey in front of me is—</p>
<p>"Are you Meihouwang?"</p>
<p>[This guy. It's quite surprising that you recognize me.]</p>
<p>Meihouwang snorted, placed his hands on his waist and looked triumphant.</p>
<p>Anyway, Meihouwang is a Narrative-grade Constellation that represents the birth of 'Sun Wukong'. According to Kim Dokja, it was the Constellation equivalent of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p>However… What is this?</p>
<p>The impact felt by Meihouwang was not large. At first, I thought it was because I was getting stronger, but I didn't think that was the case.</p>
<p>Is he hiding his true power?</p>
<p>That may be so. Because all Sun Wukongs are good at adjusting the level of the story.</p>
<p>But even so, is it possible for Meihouwang, a Narrative-grade Constellation, to appear here in an incarnation body?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Since everything that happens these days completely ignores probability, I now doubt whether probability even exists in this world.</p>
<p>[Is that how you see it?]</p>
<p>I guess I was staring too hard.</p>
<p>King Mifu said while scratching his golden hair.</p>
<p>[Is this guy also in love with my fur? Well, even the Great Sage guy is jealous of my fur. He is a man with eyes to see.]</p>
<p>When he says Great Sage, he probably means Great Sage Heaven’s Equal.</p>
<p>Meihouwang chuckled and said with his deep eyes flashing.</p>
<p>[You probably know why I came.]</p>
<p>"I can guess."</p>
<p>Just a few hours ago, I received a message from the 'Monkey' faction saying they were recruiting me.</p>
<p>And the Meihouwang before my eyes was the famous 'Monkey King'.</p>
<p>[The faction 'Monkey God' invites you.]</p>
<p>In other words, Meihouwang is the master of the 'Monkey God' faction.</p>
<p>It's not another monkey, it's Meihouwang.. The scale of the 'Zodiac Ball' might be bigger than I thought.</p>
<p>[Hmm. Even though I came in person, the response was only that much?]</p>
<p>When I saw Meihouwang’s disapproving expression, I thought it was a pity. I should have asked to take a picture together.</p>
<p>[Insolent bastard, come join my forces.]</p>
<p>Meihouwang, like Sun Wukong, didn't even listen to my answer and just kept talking.</p>
<p>[I liked your story. I allow you to become my incarnation.]</p>
<p>To be honest, it would be a lie if I said there wasn't a part that tempted me.</p>
<p>He is the incarnation body of Meihouwang.</p>
<p>If I wasn't the incarnation of the 'Demon King of Salvation', I might have been quite attracted to it.</p>
<p>If I can persuade Meihouwang to succeed in the '4-stage union of Sun Wukong' and then evolve him into 'The AncientLiberator', I will have the strongest Mythical Constellation in history as my sponsor.</p>
<p>Of course, it was a wrong assumption at this point.</p>
<p>"I’m sorry, but I already have a Constellation—"</p>
<p>[Hmph, I already know that your idiot sponsor is away. Are you ignoring me?]</p>
<p>"Even if he is away, once you are behind someone , you are always behind them."</p>
<p>It wasn't even in my mind, but Kim Dokja would have said this. As expected, Meihouwang’s reaction was not bad.</p>
<p>[This guy is more loyal than I thought. I like it.]</p>
<p>"Thank you for your understanding."</p>
<p>[If that’s the case, I will directly order 'cancellation of the Constellation Contract'.]</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>It occurred to me later that I had made a mistake. Meihouwang is Sun Wukong, who has the most eccentric personality among his brothers. He was a 'King of Monkeys' who did whatever he wanted to do.</p>
<p>Just as I was wondering what kind of incredible lie I had to tell to avoid this situation—</p>
<p>A skein of shining golden thread flew from somewhere.</p>
<p>The skein of thread wrapped exactly around Meihouwang’s head. The sound of an order was heard afterwards. Meihouwang, who was holding his head, let out an undignified scream.</p>
<p>[Ngegegegegegegegye—]</p>
<p>[The story 'Monkey Seal' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>It's a story about overpowering 'Meihouwang'.</p>
<p>[Okay! I knew!]</p>
<p>With a 'pop' sound, Meihouwang turned into a small monkey. Meihouwang, who was glaring at me disapprovingly, did a somersault, jumped backwards sharply, and climbed on top of a woman.</p>
<p>The woman smiled bitterly at Meihouwang, who shouted "Ukkkkkkk".</p>
<p>"I told you not to do that, right?"</p>
<p>A unique, clear voice that reassures people.</p>
<p>I often thought,</p>
<p>If Yoo Sangah existed in reality, she might have been that person.</p>
<p>Another person in this world who calls me 'writer'.</p>
<p>"Have you written any side stories in the meantime, author?"</p>
<p>Editor Ji Eunyu was there.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Ji Eunyu and I parted ways during the fierce battle at the Washington Dome. At that time, she had neither the time nor the presence of mind to say hello.</p>
<p>On one side, the Demon King of Salvation was dying, and on the other side, Yoo Joonghyuk, who had become a black beast, was running rampant.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Meihouwang' looks at you with disapproving eyes.]</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was only one monkey running wild right now, and even that monkey had calmed down in Ji Eunyu's arms.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because she had subdued Meihouwang, but it seemed as if a halo could be seen behind Ji Eunyu's back.</p>
<p>"Your spirit has turned white."</p>
<p>"Author, it looks like you’re having a hard time."</p>
<p>"Is it noticeable even though I’m wearing a mask?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I can see it."</p>
<p>We exchanged casual greetings and smiled at each other.</p>
<p>There is a unique feeling of relief when I am with Ji Eunyu. I feel like it's okay even if I make mistakes.</p>
<p>My editor not only finds spelling and spacing, but also finds sentences I forgot to write.</p>
<p>She could tell whether I was confident in my writing by reading just a few sentences of the manuscript.</p>
<p>"It’s noticeable."</p>
<p>That's what Ji Eunyu said when I asked her how she knew.</p>
<p>"Editor. I have a lot to ask. Especially…"</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu noticed my sidelong glance at Meihouwang and cleared her throat slightly.</p>
<p>"Have you forgotten who my sponsor is?"</p>
<p>A bit late, a series of information came to mind.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the Constellation that Ji Eunyu signed a contract with was 'Lotus Flower Blooming Under the Moonlight'— 'Yoo Sangah, the Emperor of the Moonlight', a member of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;.</p>
<p>"I chose 'Monkey' among the zodiac signs. I thought that would be the easiest to conquer."</p>
<p>In the story, Yoo Sangah goes through the 'Island of the Reincarnated' and is resurrected through the incarnation of Tang Sanzang(?).</p>
<p>In fact, most of the 'Yeonhwadae' and related skills used by Yoo Sangah are borrowed from Sanzang’s tale.</p>
<p>The metaphor is a judgment.</p>
<p>"If I go to the 'Monkey' faction, I can use my sponsor’s story."</p>
<p>I was secretly impressed.</p>
<p>"But the monkey force could have been without Sun Wukong."</p>
<p>"This is the 'Recycling Center'. I thought Sun Wukong would definitely be there. Instead, it’s the somewhat unpopular Sun Wukong."</p>
<p>Indeed, the power of reasoning to find even unwritten sentences.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Meihouwang' is complaining that he is ignored again!]</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu gently scratched Meihouwang’s chin and continued her words.</p>
<p>"And when I got to the monkey area, there was this big cave. I was immediately convinced."</p>
<p>"Huagua Mountain Convergence Cave."</p>
<p>"Yes, there was this person there."</p>
<p>Who would have guessed that the 'Monkey Area' of the Chinese zodiac was the birthplace of Meihouwang?</p>
<p>It was undoubtedly an excellent place for 'Recycling'.</p>
<p>"Author, you didn’t choose any faction, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I knew you would. Because you’re the type of person who only takes the hardest path."</p>
<p>"It really wasn’t easy this time."</p>
<p>"Still, you definitely feel different than before. Your back seems to have straightened a bit."</p>
<p>"Is that so?"</p>
<p>I looked down at my body again. Now that I think about it, I feel like my body has improved a little.</p>
<p>"I understand that you went around having fun without writing what you were told to write."</p>
<p>Although I heard some nagging, meeting Ji Eunyu here was a blessing.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Meihouwang doesn't seem to have any particular hostility towards us.</p>
<p>[Level 2 of the exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is activated.]</p>
<p>It was then that I suddenly heard a skill activation message.</p>
<p>[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint has never been activated in this way, so maybe it's the influence of the 'Constellation Act'.]</p>
<p>I could hear someone's inner thoughts in my head.</p>
<p>「Who is it.」</p>
<p>I immediately knew whose thoughts those were. This person doesn't use question marks even when thinking.</p>
<p>「She called him writer.」</p>
<p>"By the way, I’m late for the introduction. Editor, this is Cha Yerin. Yerin, this is my editor."</p>
<p>But this time, I heard the other side’s inner thoughts.</p>
<p>「Writer, is it okay to say that?」</p>
<p>There were a little too many 'inner feelings'.</p>
<p>「Did he reveal that he was a writer?」</p>
<p>「Then it’ll be a little bit difficult, right?」</p>
<p>Yes. therefore.</p>
<p>「If it’s someone he can trust, it’ll be okay.」</p>
<p>「But Kim Dokja didn’t reveal his identity until much later.」</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>「What if that person betrays us?」</p>
<p>「I think we need to come up with a separate response plan.」</p>
<p>「As a first measure—」</p>
<p>I quickly intervened before Ji Eunyu’s plan of action could progress any further.</p>
<p>"Editor, this person is my reader. You can rest assured."</p>
<p>"Ah."</p>
<p>"I revealed my secret. She is my only reader."</p>
<p>"The only… reader?"</p>
<p>I happened to express it that way, but it wasn't wrong.</p>
<p>Cha Yerin is probably the only person who read and remembers my debut work.</p>
<p>「Then what about me?」</p>
<p>Eh?</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you. I’m Ji Eunyu. I’m the person who reads and edits the author’s writing before anyone else."</p>
<p>Only then did I suddenly come to my senses.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, Cha Yerin wasn't the only one. Although she may not have read my debut novel, Ji Eunyu was a reader who read my novels before anyone else and read them more.</p>
<p>"I’m Cha Yerin. I’ve read all of his novels."</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu's expression changed completely after hearing Cha Yerin's introduction.</p>
<p>"You’ve read all of the Author’s novels?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Even the Genesis trilogy?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You’re a complete Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja…"</p>
<p>Cha Yerin awkwardly looked down at her toes.</p>
<p>Now I understand. That's an embarrassing expression.</p>
<p>"What path did you take when reading the book?"</p>
<p>"I read it in paperback first, but I bought it all later. The serial version, the copy, and—"</p>
<p>"Wow! Thank you so much! What are you doing, writer? You need to thank her quickly."</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>I suddenly said thanks to her.</p>
<p>"Louder! She’s the one who saved our management from almost being ruined!"</p>
<p>"Thank you!"</p>
<p>"If you need an autographed copy, please let me know anytime! I don’t have the book right now, but—"</p>
<p>When I thought about it, this was Ji Eunyu’s true self. I was worried for no reason.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Meihouwang' yawns, saying he doesn’t know what you are talking about.]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Meihouwang' urges you to proceed with the scenario quickly.]</p>
<p>"Look at that. Come to think of it, this wasn’t the time."</p>
<p>"Yes, well. Let’s leave our greetings like this."</p>
<p>"Do you know where this place is?"</p>
<p>In response to Ji Eunyu’s question, I looked around at the surrounding scenery.</p>
<p>"Yes. I know."</p>
<p>A landscape covered in clouds everywhere.</p>
<p>「This is the place where Kim Dokja waited for the carriage during the 'Constellation Banquet'.」</p>
<p>The name of this place is 'Cloud Road'.</p>
<p>A place that serves as a tributary and station connecting the scenarios of the &lt;Star Stream&gt;. That means,</p>
<p>"The carriage will be here soon."</p>
<p>As if to prove my thoughts, I saw something like a small dot flying from afar in the sky. The dot grew bigger little by little, and as expected, it took on the shape of a carriage.</p>
<p>Cha Yerin said with admiration.</p>
<p>"A carriage like that came during the Constellation Banquet."</p>
<p>At that time, it was Apollo's golden chariot.</p>
<p>The carriage coming this time was also a luxurious golden carriage.</p>
<p>The difference was that this time it was the little rats that were pulling the carriage.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Meihouwang' is complaining that the organizers have used their coins in the wrong place again.]</p>
<p>A golden carriage at the 'Recycling Center'. Perhaps in which scenario was that used first?</p>
<p>[New sub-scenario has arrived!]</p>
<fieldset>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">&lt;Sub Scenario - Orient Express Wagon&gt;</h3>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: S++</p>
<p>Clear conditions: Get on the carriage. Arrive at your destination safely.</p>
<p>Time limit: 2 hours</p>
<p>Reward: 'Zodiac Ball' admission ticket.</p>
<p>Failure: Death.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>On the outside, it was such a peaceful scenario that one wondered if this could even be a scenario. But.</p>
<p>"Is this it?"</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu asked.</p>
<p>"That’s it."</p>
<p>I answered.</p>
<p>As any aspiring Killer King knows, the carriage Kim Dokja is riding in in the 'Constellations' Banquet' is attacked by Constellations and crashes.</p>
<p>The mere fact that 'riding on a carriage' came up as a scenario means that this carriage will inevitably suffer the same fate.</p>
<p>Above all, the meaningful sentence 'arrive at your destination safely' proved this.</p>
<p>I smiled bitterly and opened my mouth.</p>
<p>"There is no way to get over this easily."</p>
<p>"Who can I blame?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"I told you when I was serializing. Sometimes you need an easy scenario so readers can take a break."</p>
<p>I didn't know it would come back to me like this either.</p>
<p>"I was wrong."</p>
<p>Even the difficulty level of the sub-scenario is S++.</p>
<p>At this point, I suspect that the 'Recycling Center’s Director' may also be a possessed person.</p>
<p>A carriage that strangely resembled Apollo's golden carriage finally stopped in front of me. The squeaking rats lowered their heads as if to say hello.</p>
<p>The moment I put my hand on the carriage door handle to board, a message came out.</p>
<p>[Only designated incarnations can ride this carriage.]</p>
<p>[Story fragment 'Facial Recognition' is activated.]</p>
<p>It’s a carriage with a 'face recognition' function.</p>
<p>Was it by any chance made in &lt;Emperor&gt;?</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu and Cha Yerin, who completed facial recognition, boarded in turn, followed by my turn.</p>
<p>[Face recognition failed.]</p>
<p>I thought it was broken, but when I thought about it, I was still wearing the mask. It's not even a metaphorical object for the carriage, so no one would recognize me wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Now that the Zone 13 scenario was over, there was no reason to insist on masking any longer.</p>
<p>[Release the 'mask'.]</p>
<p>As I took off my mask for the first time in a while, the stuffy feeling disappeared and cool air enveloped my face.</p>
<p>I relaxed my neck for a moment and lightly rolled my shoulders, but my face felt strangely hot.</p>
<p>When I looked up, Ji Eunyu and Cha Yerin were looking at me with surprised eyes.</p>
<p>[The Constellation Meihouwang is looking at you blankly.]</p>
<p>The same was true for Meihouwang, who was sitting on Ji Eunyu’s head.</p>
<p>What followed was Meihouwang’s voice heard in my ears.</p>
<p>[This guy. That’s interesting.]</p>
<p>My face was reflected in the carriage window that slowly opened.</p>
<p>I stared at this face for a long time, even forgetting that I had to get on the carriage.</p>
<p>The person I possessed was clearly Cheon Inho. However,</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' smiles with satisfaction as he looks at you.]</p>
<p>Reflected in the window, I was wearing Kim Dokja’s face.</p>
