<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">747 Episode 30 Zodiac (9)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>It wasn't a metaphor. The road was literally opening up before my eyes.</p>
<p>A pleasant tailwind that spreads throughout my body.</p>
<p>[Story fragment 'Way of the Wind' circles around you.]</p>
<p>Once I took one step, I could see where to take the next step, and where to take the next step.</p>
<p>This was [Way of the Wind].</p>
<p>Kim Dokja's main skill, as acknowledged by others, is No. 1.</p>
<p>With this skill, Kim Dokja took one step at a time and reached the end of the world.</p>
<p>[The story fragment 'Way of the Wind' nods.]</p>
<p>If someone had seen it, they might have asked if it was just [Way of the Wind]. But for me, the fact that I got as close to the 'Demon King of Salvation' with [Way of the Wind] alone was important.</p>
<p>[That power.]</p>
<p>The 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' looked at me and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>[Interesting.]</p>
<p>The 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' had an expression as if he were Yoo Joonghyuk from the 137th round, who defeated the Dream Eater.</p>
<p>[Is this a story fragment given to you by the dead wolf?]</p>
<p>"Lycaon is not dead. There is no way he could have been killed by a Constellation that was barely Historical-grade."</p>
<p>For a very brief moment, a slight agitation flashed across the 'Tiger'’s face.</p>
<p>"Now, go back. I think you’ve had enough of bean rice cake or sirutteok."</p>
<p>[I'm still hungry.]</p>
<p>"You don’t seem to know, but that’s 'fake hunger'. It means you’re not really hungry."</p>
<p>The 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' is a Constellation that exists based on the story of 'The Sun and the Moon'. There are many mixed stories, but basically, he was a guy who tried to eat the main character's brother and sister, but failed and fell into a sorghum field and died.</p>
<p>Because he was unable to obtain what he wanted in the end, his story is full of resentment, hatred, and greed.</p>
<p>"If you fail to manage false hunger, you will experience accelerated aging. Don’t you know?"</p>
<p>His thirst and hunger were both triggered by his stories.</p>
<p>[Little one, human life is too short to understand the Constellations.]</p>
<p>But what if the soul of an ordinary person suddenly possessed someone somewhere in the middle of the story?</p>
<p>"Since when were you a Constellation?"</p>
<p>Now I can see it. A small soul swaying slightly among the stories surrounding him. A small piece, or a soul smaller than soybean paste.</p>
<p>"I don’t know who you really were, but I ask you for one last time. Please get out of here."</p>
<p>That Constellation was a 'reader'. Even if not now, he was definitely a reader at least at one time.</p>
<p>That's why I endured that spirit just once.</p>
<p>"I will keep my promise to you. I will definitely attend the Chinese Zodiac Ball, but I cannot be your agent."</p>
<p>At the last moment, Lycaon spoke.</p>
<p>「Become the Kim Dokja you want to be.」</p>
<p>The Kim Dokja I want.</p>
<p>I don't know what that is.</p>
<p>Maybe that is not Kim Dokja, and maybe there is no such thing in the world.</p>
<p>However, if such a 'Kim Dokja' really exists,</p>
<p>"Leave from here immediately."</p>
<p>That 'Kim Dokja' will give the 'reader' in front of him one chance.</p>
<p>Of course, whether he would receive that opportunity was a separate matter.</p>
<p>Tsutsutsu, the ground in the area violently vibrated along with the sound.</p>
<p>Now that the 'scale of probability' has disappeared, the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' will not be able to show the power to astonish the world as before.</p>
<p>But it didn't seem like he would go away like this. Because he still had the justification of 'contract with me'.</p>
<p>[Do you think you have become someone great just by learning Way of the Wind?]</p>
<p>It was clearly a disparaging tone.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>He is indeed a 'Constellation' and [Way of the Wind] is at best a technique used to seal the 'Disaster of Questions'.</p>
<p>"Do you know much about Way of the Wind?"</p>
<p>The 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' stretched out his front paws into the air without saying a word. Then the blood-red rope tied to his front paw swirled and flew toward me.</p>
<p>I guess my patience ends here. Now I have to recommend 're-reading' to our readers.</p>
<p>[Your exclusive attribute is activated.]</p>
<p>[Your understanding of the story fragment 'Way of the Wind' is very high!]</p>
<p>I quickly rose to the level of the guy who was tens of meters tall.</p>
<p>Once, twice, three times, I can see where I need to step to accelerate faster. I accelerated and accelerated to the point where I couldn't even hear the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' shout.</p>
<p>At the end of that acceleration, there was 'Unbreakable Faith'.</p>
<p>Although the skill was sealed and I couldn’t use [White Blue Steel], it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>[The story fragment 'Way of the Wind' follows your will.]</p>
<p>「Way of the Wind was not simply a technique used to accelerate the body or fly through the air.」</p>
<p>Just as Kim Dokja used [Way of the Wind] to create a 'vacuum prison' to overcome the disaster of questions, there are endless ways to use technology depending on how you understand the wind.</p>
<p>[Little one, if you don’t stop right away—!]</p>
<p>The front paw of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' flew towards me precisely. I dodged the guy's front foot with a narrow trajectory, and then slammed 'Unbreakable Faith' onto his forearm.</p>
<p>An attack that would normally not work.</p>
<p>But now, [Way of the Wind] was wrapped around my 'Unbreakable Faith'.</p>
<p>Kuddddd.</p>
<p>The so-called [Wind Blade]. It was an application of Lycaon's enlightenment of constantly rotating using the drawings of straight lines and curves.</p>
<p>A story bounced from his front paw with a light sibilant sound.</p>
<p>The 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' sighed briefly and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>[You have quite a bit of talent when it comes to small sections.]</p>
<p>I responded with a grin.</p>
<p>"You speak like a real Constellation."</p>
<p>[What?]</p>
<p>"Is there an academy that teaches how to speak like this? Or…"</p>
<p>[The story 'The old and sick guardian spirit' is angry at you!]</p>
<p>"Are you being controlled by that old story?”</p>
<p>The 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake’ exploded with the Tiger’s Claws. It felt like a bomb made of sound was exploding across the sky.</p>
<p>「Way of the Wind was activated to its maximum level to simplify the impact.」</p>
<p>I fell to the ground, rolled around in the clearing, and then woke up. Blood flowed from the corner of my mouth.</p>
<p>Is it not possible yet?</p>
<p>Well, if just learning [Way of the Wind] would equal a Historical-grade Constellation, Kim Dokja wouldn't have gone through that trouble.</p>
<p>In any case, the provocation seemed to have worked well, as old stories from the predecessor of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' were running wild.</p>
<p>Did this buy me some time?</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja, what on earth are you thinking?"</p>
<p>Killer King, who flew in using [Way of the Wind], supported me and said.</p>
<p>"What you see is what it is."</p>
<p>I said, looking up at the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' running wild.</p>
<p>"I want to fight that guy and win."</p>
<p>"You are so crazy."</p>
<p>Killer King was silent for a moment.</p>
<p>He just lowered his head in exasperation and added a word while deliberately ignoring me.</p>
<p>"Sorry."</p>
<p>"What? I just chose this because it was more fun."</p>
<p>"...Because it’s fun?"</p>
<p>"Because it deserves to be more of a 'story'."</p>
<p>Kim Dokja said something similar every time he made an absurd choice.</p>
<p>Because this is more fun.</p>
<p>This is a development that the Constellations will be more pleased with.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' snorts.]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Reclining Dragon' is surprised by your judgment.]</p>
<p>But was that really just a consideration of the Constellations’ gaze?</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'The One Who Brought Ten Lambs' is worried about you.]</p>
<p>In fact, perhaps Kim Dokja himself wanted that development to unfold.</p>
<p>"Dokja-ssi."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Before I knew it, Kyung Sein had flown in and was standing next to me.</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>Before I could answer, Kyung Sein burst out saying the words she had been holding back.</p>
<p>"I was so nervous because I thought you were really leaving us behind! Although I trust the other group members—"</p>
<p>"Aren’t we the people who gathered around 'Kim Dokja'?"</p>
<p>Dansu ahjussi also added his words.</p>
<p>Cha Yerin and Ye Hyunwoo also stood on either side of the group as if they agreed.</p>
<p>Killer King asked,</p>
<p>"What is the operation?"</p>
<p>"You just have to hold on for now. Until he becomes less probable ."</p>
<p>"Is that even a strategy?"</p>
<p>"I thought it was a plan worthy of Killer King."</p>
<p>I briefly conveyed the situation to my companions through [group chat].</p>
<p>It was about the 'invitation to the Chinese Zodiac Ball' that I and the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' had formed.</p>
<p>Killer King, who heard everything, said with admiration.</p>
<p>"I see. It’s a plan worth setting up."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"But can that also be a probability of advent?"</p>
<p>I nodded and answered Kyung Sein's question.</p>
<p>"It’s a small probability. So, he won’t be able to stay strong for long. There’s no way he’ll be able to use his strength properly."</p>
<p>"What if you’re wrong?"</p>
<p>"Even if I’m wrong."</p>
<p>I continued, measuring the depth of the night sky.</p>
<p>"If we last until midnight tonight, we can win for sure."</p>
<p>"Midnight?"</p>
<p>[New sub-scenario has arrived!]</p>
<p>The sub-scenario had just arrived.</p>
<p>For some reason, it seemed like the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' didn’t react for quite a long time, and it seems like it was a precursor to the scenario.</p>
<fieldset>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">&lt;Sub Scenario – Chinese Zodiac Race&gt;</h3>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: S+</p>
<p>Clear conditions: Survive the zodiac sign 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake'.</p>
<p>Time Limit: —</p>
<p>Reward: Unidentified story fragment, 300,000 coins, ???</p>
<p>Failure: Death.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>The strategy goal is not 'kill' but 'survive'.</p>
<p>That meant that this fight was unfavorable to us.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the scenario, the 'Tiger' who calmed down the stories frowned.</p>
<p>[They are really annoying people.]</p>
<p>Although his tone is threatening, he is no longer able to launch powerful attacks in succession like before. No matter how likely it is that he came to keep his contract with me, there is no way he could cause an unreasonable hemorrhage like when he confronted Lycaon.</p>
<p>[The story 'The One Who Calls The Ghost' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he was still a 'Constellation'.</p>
<p>[Stand up, you devils.]</p>
<p>Changgui.</p>
<p>A term used since ancient times to refer to a ghost who died after being bitten by a tiger.</p>
<p>It was a similar story to the 「King of the Dead」 used by 'Davids', a ranker of the Dark Castle.</p>
<p>Oooooh!</p>
<p>The incarnations buried throughout Zone 13 began to rise one by one. The corpse-like incarnations turned their empty eyes towards me. They were all prisoners killed by tigers.</p>
<p>"Damn it, are they demons?"</p>
<p>"It’s similar. But I can’t use my original abilities properly."</p>
<p>Although there were a lot of them, looking at them attacking us, fortunately there were no strong incarnations.</p>
<p>I think it's still worth doing at this level...</p>
<p>[The story ´Compatible Mama' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>One of the prisoners that was standing nearby clutched his head as if he was frightened.</p>
<p>The moment I hurriedly extended my hand towards him.</p>
<p>"Save me—"</p>
<p>The beastman’s head exploded with a pop sound.</p>
<p>I got goosebumps.</p>
<p>He even used this story?</p>
<p>Tsutsutsutsu.</p>
<p>A white spark.</p>
<p>The 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' had decided.</p>
<p>Even if he has to endure some repercussions, he will definitely end this scenario in the way he wants.</p>
<p>"Focus on the masks everyone is wearing!"</p>
<p>I shouted to my colleagues and prisoners.</p>
<p>「Compatible Mama.」</p>
<p>A story that refers to both the 'misfortune suffered by a tiger' and 'an epidemic'.</p>
<p>The characteristic of the story is 'fear contagion'.</p>
<p>Incarnations consumed by fear lose their ego and their heads explode and they die.</p>
<p>"We must spread the word and stop the spread of fear!"</p>
<p>Fear is ultimately the fear of the unknown.</p>
<p>To overcome fear, you need to redirect your gaze. I must listen to the stories that I know well and that make up myself.</p>
<p>[The story 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear' nods.]</p>
<p>I was hardly influenced by「Compatible Mama.」</p>
<p>However, the situation seemed to be a little different for my colleagues.</p>
