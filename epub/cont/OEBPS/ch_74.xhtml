<p>rlaehrwk37: But isn’t he passing out too often?</p>
</fieldset>
<p>When I opened my eyes again, it was night. In the faint hunger and thirst, I blinked my eyes, then raised my upper body.</p>
<p>How many times have I fainted?</p>
<p>At this point, it was not the time to tease Kim Dokja by calling him a 'fainting man'.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>I didn't get to meet Kim Dokja this time. Usually, whenever I passed out, I met him in the snowfield.</p>
<p>An old table and countertop were visible in the dim darkness.</p>
<p>I wondered what kind of kitchen it was, but it seemed to be inside a nearby restaurant.</p>
<p>"Woke up?"</p>
<p>In the darkness, Jung Heewon's face appeared.</p>
<p>"Ah yes."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, who had her hair done with pride, was sharpening her knife under the moonlight.</p>
<p>While I was feeling something eerie, I held out the temperance pot that Jung Heewon had placed next to me.</p>
<p>"Would you like to eat this?"</p>
<p>Inside the pot were several grains of gourd crops and roasted foreleg.</p>
<p>"I’m not good at cooking, so I only seasoned it. There was some seasoning left in the restaurant."</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you."</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I haven't eaten anything all day.</p>
<p>When I ate food rich in seasoning after a long time, the taste buds on the tip of my tongue went cold.</p>
<p>It was a melting feeling.</p>
<p>As the hunger and thirst subsided, I thought that I would live a little longer, and I was on the verge of fainting.</p>
<p>The situation came to mind spontaneously.</p>
<p>I was having a conversation with Yoo Joonghyuk. Jung Heewon was away for a while to catch the sniper.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk asked me who Kim Dokja was, and I thought about it… and passed out?</p>
<p>Jung Heewon held out water to me as I choked on food.</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>Looking back, I couldn't understand the last situation.</p>
<p>Why did I faint while thinking about Kim Dokja?</p>
<p>Wait, other than that.</p>
<p>"Where is Yoo Joonghyuk?"</p>
<p>"He went alone."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon answered, changing her words indifferently.</p>
<p>"Leaving us?"</p>
<p>Jung Heewon only nodded. But why do you keep being like that?</p>
<p>With a thud, Jung Heewon put down the clean knife.</p>
<p>I had a feeling that something wasn't right.</p>
<p>I think she’s going to get mad.</p>
<p>"I thought I told you not to die."</p>
<p>A strangely sparkly voice.</p>
<p>"Did you know how surprised I was?"</p>
<p>Jung Heewon glared at me with her eyes narrowed. I hurriedly narrowed my eyes and apologized.</p>
<p>"I-I'm sorry. But I don't know why that happened either. I passed out all of a sudden."</p>
<p>"Really?</p>
<p>"Yes, really."</p>
<p>"It can't be. Were you threatened by that man?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Weren’t you beaten or mistreated? Take off your shirt."</p>
<p>"I'm not, really."</p>
<p>I answered while sneaking away from Jung Heewon, who reached out.</p>
<p>"I didn't really do anything. I just passed out while talking. I guess I'm a bit tired."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon blinked in disbelief and sighed.</p>
<p>"My God. It was real."</p>
<p>When I saw the expression on her face, there was a situation that was drawn in my head belatedly.</p>
<p>No way?</p>
<p>She dismissed the sniper at the request of Yoo Joonghyuk. The situation where we were away, but I was lying on the spot when she returned.</p>
<p>"Did you fight?"</p>
<p>"We were about to fight."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon pursed her lips and said.</p>
<p>"But he said he felt a bit unfair. He said he didn't do anything, but Inho-ssi collapsed by himself."</p>
<p>"So what?"</p>
<p>"Of course I didn't believe it. Does that make sense?"</p>
<p>It makes no sense.</p>
<p>"I almost got into trouble."</p>
<p>"I was almost on the verge of drawing a knife, but the words of Dansu-ahjussi came to mind."</p>
<p>Dansu-ahjussi?</p>
<p>"Before we broke up, the man said that, if I go out with that man, there will be a situation where I will get angry all of a sudden, and then go to sleep."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>I really appreciate Dansu-ahjussi’s wise judgment.</p>
<p>"He said there could be a misunderstanding."</p>
<p>Even in the past, the Dansu-ahjussi was misunderstood alone when everyone thought of Yoo Joonghyuk badly.</p>
<p>He said it might be.</p>
<p>Ahjussi’s wisdom is really amazing.</p>
<p>"The misunderstanding is correct. I really fell alone."</p>
<p>"Then I'm glad."</p>
<p>By the way, Yoo Joonghyuk and Kim Dokja became a company at most, but he went away like this.</p>
<p>"Where did Yoo Joonghyuk go?"</p>
<p>"To the north."</p>
<p>If it's in the north, he must have gone to rescue his younger sister, Yoo Mia.</p>
<p>Because right now is the right time.</p>
<p>"Do you have anything else to say?"</p>
<p>"He said he wouldn’t go out with you anymore."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"He doesn’t need a weak guy who faints all the time…"</p>
<p>It was embarrassing, but it was right.</p>
<p>"The current Inho-ssi cannot properly play the role of Cheon Inho, and he told me to tell you that."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk said, if I could play the role of Cheon Inho, he would believe that I am Cheon Inho.</p>
<p>In other words, it means that I am now disqualified.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>Of course, to miss Yoo Joonghyuk at such an important moment.</p>
<p>My mind was complicated.</p>
<p>Soon, the battle for the flag will be over, and the 'King's Road' scenario will begin.</p>
<p>Then, going to the 'absolute throne' will be in an instant.</p>
<p>"But Inho-ssi, why do you want to hang out with him?"</p>
<p>Jung Heewon asked as if she did not understand.</p>
<p>"You haven't forgotten what kind of person he is, right? Me and Inho-ssi, we were in danger because of him."</p>
<p>Hearing that, I remembered that I hadn't explained anything to Jung Heewon until now.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon could not understand this situation, because that Yoo Joonghyuk was a human who threw me and Jung Heewon as food for sea  monsters.</p>
<p>"Is there a reason you have to be with that person all this time?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>In the end, it was Yoo Joonghyuk who held the key to this world. He is a regressor of the 41st round.</p>
<p>The strongest incarnation.</p>
<p>However, that Yoo Joonghyuk eventually met a tragic ruin at the end of the 41st turn.</p>
<p>In order to prevent that ending, I had no choice but to correct his risky behaviors one by one.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon opened her mouth after a while.</p>
<p>She said, "I heard that Inho-ssi is also an apostle. Is it a problem related to that?"</p>
<p>I involuntarily stopped breathing. When I raised my head, I saw Jung Heewon with a dark complexion.</p>
<p>How long did Jung Heewon ponder over it before asking that question?</p>
<p>"You're right."</p>
<p>A feeling of late guilt came over me.</p>
<p>As Yoo Joonghyuk said, if I was 'Cheon Inho' now, it was Jung Heewon in front of me who protected me.</p>
<p>I could not have survived at Geumho Station and Chungmuro Station without her help.</p>
<p>And to her, I left out important explanations.</p>
<p>「Throughout the scenario, Jung Heewon would have been confused.」</p>
<p>For her, who was an ordinary person, the cataclysm of her world, the scenarios and the constellations as well. It must have been a difficult story.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, the apostles who knew her future appeared, and even those apostles were her own companions.</p>
<p>"Sorry. I haven't told you anything for too long. Where did you hear that I'm an apostle?"</p>
<p>"Just all over the place. I heard people talking."</p>
<p>Even if she pretended not to hear or not see, it seemed that she was actually listening. Even so, Jung Heewon waited for me to speak all along.</p>
<p>"Do you know the 'future' of this world, too?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I know."</p>
<p>Now is the time to talk to Jung Heewon. Just like Kim Dokja did in the main story, I also have to break through this head-on.</p>
<p>I slowly got up from my seat and bowed my head to Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>"Sorry for hiding it for so long. I won't make excuses. I know the future of this world, and I knew of Heewon-ssi's existence from before."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Embarrassed by my sudden apology, Jung Heewon stood up from her seat.</p>
<p>"To prevent the destruction of this world, Heewon's help was absolutely necessary. Actually, that's why I tried to become friends with Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p>Since Jung Heewon had come this far, I couldn't hide it any longer. Because that’d be deceiving her.</p>
<p>"So you were trying to be friendly with me?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>She shuddered and thought there was nothing she could do. But some relationships can't go forward unless they're particularly weak.</p>
<p>I bit my lip and quietly lifted my head. Of course, I thought Jung Heewon would have a disappointed face.</p>
<p>Rather, she had a puzzled expression.</p>
<p>"But... I didn't really feel that way. I was the one who went and talked to you first when I was alone, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>I pondered.</p>
<p>"That… I guess I was lucky."</p>
<p>"If I hadn’t been Jung Heewon, wouldn’t we have become close?"</p>
<p>I thought for a moment.</p>
<p>If Jung Heewon wasn't Jung Heewon, would I have been close to her?</p>
<p>"No. I think we wouldn’t."</p>
<p>The person I liked was Jung Heewon, and the person I needed was also Jung Heewon. She may be angry, but it was a meaningless assumption to me in the first place.</p>
<p>"As expected, Inho-ssi is honest."</p>
<p>"Sorry."</p>
<p>"What do you have to be sorry about? Thank god, because I am Jung Heewon."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Because I am Jung Heewon, Inho-ssi risked his life for me. It was the same on the bridge and the Theater Dungeon back then. If Inho-ssi wasn’t there, I would have died that day."</p>
<p>How is this person…</p>
<p>A sentence came to mind with a momentary sense of tingling.</p>
<p>「That I was able to come this far thanks to her.」</p>
<p>I unknowingly bit my lip. Why does that sentence come to mind now?</p>
<p>「"Thank you for finding me. I'm not being sarcastic, I mean it."」</p>
<p>How can this person be so consistent even though the speaker is different?</p>
<p>"I'm going crazy too. I am alive here thanks to Heewon."</p>
<p>Even knowing that the sentences in my memory do not explain the Jung Heewon in front of me, it was hard to hide my excitement.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Actually, I didn't want to ask until the end. I wanted you to tell me someday. But, on the roof of the Theater Dungeon, I had a rather strange experience. From then on, I was a bit confused."</p>
<p>The roof of the Theater Dungeon.</p>
<p>I belatedly remembered what  had happened with Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p>["This world, that, no…"]</p>
<p>There, Han Sooyoung showed Jung Heewon the story of Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint.</p>
<p>"What was the story about?"</p>
<p>How else am I supposed to explain that?</p>
<p>"It's a story from a different world than this one."</p>
<p>No matter how much I thought about it, it was best to return Jung Heewon's answer as it was.</p>
<p>"Then all the stories she told me really happened."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right."</p>
<p>I thought for a moment about the story of that world.</p>
<p>The world where Kim Dokja and &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; existed. A world where Jung Heewon became the judge of destruction and Cheon Inho died at her hands.</p>
<p>"In that world, Inho-ssi was a complete badass."</p>
<p>In Jung Heewon's hand was a well-forged Mikazuki Munechika.</p>
<p>I thought of Cheon Inho, who was killed by her sword.</p>
<p>Cheon Inho, the villain of 'Geumho Station' who instigated, killed, and extorted coins at will.</p>
<p>Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint. Even though it was Han Sooyoung who first wrote it, I certainly wrote a sentence about it with sincerity.</p>
<p>I fiercely wrote sentences that harass, kill, and torment people.</p>
<p>Because it's villainous, because it's more violent, brutal, and probable.</p>
<p>If so, this moment may be the moment when I get back the 'probability' I used at that time.</p>
<p>"Is the Inho-ssi in front of me the same person as Inho-ssi over there?"</p>
