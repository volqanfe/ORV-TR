<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">704 Episode 25 Demon King (7)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>Nirvana Moebius.</p>
<p>A 'reincarnator' with the constellation 'Guardian of Mandala' as his sponsor.</p>
<p>Like Anna Croft, they are a being who can preserve a certain amount of memory by resisting Yoo Joonghyuk’s [regression].</p>
<p>They are the leader of the Salvation Church and was the 'counter' of Yoo Joonghyuk in the 3rd round.</p>
<p>"Only live in the present!"</p>
<p>They stomped their feet as the elephant bells thumped, accompanied by the cries of the Salvationists.</p>
<p>"There is no salvation in the afterlife!"</p>
<p>"What’s important is now!"</p>
<p>"What must be liberated is 'today'!"</p>
<p>As the ground vibrated like a giant drum, the incarnations of the area shook loudly.</p>
<p>"W-what is it?"</p>
<p>"Salvation Church? Dammit, they came?"</p>
<p>Some of the incarnations were already aware of their existence, as some of them were preparing to withdraw the moment they saw the elephant monster.</p>
<p>"I’m falling for it. I shouldn’t get involved with those crazy people."</p>
<p>However, there were still some incarnations who remained and watched.</p>
<p>Those who do not yet know much about the Salvation Church or are confident in their own abilities.</p>
<p>"Nirvana, the leader of the Salvation Church."</p>
<p>"Oh, prophet?"</p>
<p>As Nirvana waved theirhand happily, Anna Croft frowned and averted her gaze.</p>
<p>Nirvana slowly approached us and opened theirmouth.</p>
<p>"Why did my Yoo Joonghyuk end up like that? Was it your fault?"</p>
<p>"The King is not yours."</p>
<p>"Answer me. What is that demon king who is entangled with my Yoo Joonghyuk?"</p>
<p>"It’s none of your business."</p>
<p>"If I don’t care, who would care?"</p>
<p>Nirvana declared, spreading their arms wide.</p>
<p>"The relationship between me and Yoo Joonghyuk is connected by the wheel of eternity. You know because you secretly stole our story."</p>
<p>Anna Croft turned away from Nirvana and glanced towards me.</p>
<p>—Cheon Inho. You never met Nirvana in the last round, right?</p>
<p>It was [electric sound].</p>
<p>This is probably because she was wary of the existence of Nirvana.</p>
<p>It wasn't strange.</p>
<p>In this world, the only incarnations that know of Yoo Joonghyuk's [regressions] from the beginning are Anna Croft, who can use [Future Sight], and the reincarnated Nirvana.</p>
<p>Therefore, the prophet and the reincarnator have no choice but to be endlessly wary of each other over Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>"Why are you making such a fuss?"</p>
<p>In an instant, Nirvana came right in front of her and suddenly stuck out their head.</p>
<p>Also a reincarnator. Did they  notice even the use of [electric sound]?</p>
<p>The guy glared at Anna and craned their long neck to ask.</p>
<p>"Who is this guy? Prophet, is this your new toy?"</p>
<p>My face was captured in the guy's eyes that were shining with pure white light.</p>
<p>"Why are you closing your eyes? Are you saying you don’t dare look at me?"</p>
<p>The moment I was about to reply that I had been watching, their right arm moved directly towards my forehead.</p>
<p>[Relationship story.]</p>
<p>I also knew that skill. A skill to read the other person's memories by weaving the bonds of stories with the power of the mandala.</p>
<p>But someone blocked their movements.</p>
<p>Quaaaaaaaaa!</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's fist flew in an instant and exploded into the guy's face.</p>
<p>Nirvana, who had rolled dozens of times against their will, shouted while holding one side of their face.</p>
<p>"Kaaaa! What are you doing, Yoo Joonghyuk!"</p>
<p>A blow that would have exploded the head of a normal incarnation.</p>
<p>However, in this round, Nirvana appears to have steadily increased his stamina and did not die even after being hit by Yoo Joonghyuk, who had become a beast.</p>
<p>Nirvana, with black bruises on their face, cried out again as if they were aggrieved.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk!"</p>
<p>Of course, Yoo Joonghyuk, unable to communicate, just growled and cried.</p>
<p>"Where on earth are you looking? Look at me in front of you!"</p>
<p>Enraged, Nirvana's hands began to move brilliantly.</p>
<p>This guy's patented technology was activated.</p>
<p>[The incarnation 'Nirvana Moebius' activates 'Thousand-Armed Guanyin Lv.8'!]</p>
<p>A dazzlingly rotating mandala settled behind the creature, and soon a thousand arms poured out like a waterfall around the mandala.</p>
<p>"Look at me! Me! Look at me!"</p>
<p>As the palms of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara poured out and hit Yoo Joonghyuk’s head repeatedly, the beast's body began to sink to the ground little by little.</p>
<p>"Oh, that’s—"</p>
<p>"Is there also the leader of the Salvation Church?"</p>
<p>"We too are joining!"</p>
<p>I don't know how strong Nirvana will be when they grow up to the later scenarios.</p>
<p>In the main story, while fighting against Kim Dokja, Nirvana was absorbed by the [Fourth Wall] and became a librarian at the library.</p>
<p>But this world's Nirvana will never be absorbed by the [Fourth Wall].</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is glaring at incarnation 'Nirvana Moebius'.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' twitches his lips, saying that this incarnation is arrogant.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is concerned about your safety.]</p>
<p>A [reincarnator] that does not die even if they die.</p>
<p>[Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara that overwhelms even Yoo Joonghyuk, who used Giant Flower.]</p>
<p>In addition, there are mental abilities including [100 Torments] and [Eternal Nightmare].</p>
<p>Even Yoo Joonghyuk, no matter how much of a beast he has become, might not be able to deal with the current Nirvana.</p>
<p>"W-what!"</p>
<p>I thought so.</p>
<p>"He’s coming up!"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, who had been nailed to the ground by the blow of [Thousand-handed Avalokitesvara], began to stick his head out of the hole little by little.</p>
<p>Quad deud deuk!</p>
<p>A spear was held in the hands of Yoo Joonghyuk, who finally stuck his head out, pushing up his body with his paws, little by little.</p>
<p>Nirvana's eyes widened.</p>
<p>"Yoo Jong—"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk has lost his reason and only his instincts remain. Nevertheless, he was still a disciple of Breaking the Sky swordsman.</p>
<p>I don't know about other people, but only Kim Dokja and I could recognize the skill.</p>
<p>[Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.]</p>
<p>A sword technique created to tear apart the constellations of this world.</p>
<p>The swordsmanship extended into the sky.</p>
<p>"Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck—!"</p>
<p>Nirvana's [Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara] was torn apart by a blow that felt like a black lightning strike.</p>
<p>The power that comes from pure differences in 'level'.</p>
<p>The sky made of palms shattered, and the beast holding the spear let out a harsh cry toward the sky.</p>
<p>Nirvana, spilling his blood, rolled around on the floor with half of their upper body blown away.</p>
<p>I was almost daunted by the incredible scenery.</p>
<p>'Shall we run away?'</p>
<p>Does it make sense that that is just an incarnation of the 'seventh scenario'?</p>
<p>Tsutsutsutsutsu.</p>
<p>Sparks of probability began to rush through Yoo Joonghyuk’s whole body.</p>
<p>But no matter how much he becomes the prey of a 'sub-scenario', the strength that exceeds the probability limit of the scenario cannot be sustained for a long period of time. If things continue like this, it won't be long before Yoo Joonghyuk’s whole body is burned by the aftermath.</p>
<p>—Well.</p>
<p>But Kim Dokja didn't seem to think so.</p>
<p>—The balance of probabilities is not only determined through aftermath.</p>
<p>Before I could ask what that meant, Nirvana, who was thought to be dead, suddenly stood up.</p>
<p>[The incarnation 'Nirvana Moebius' activates 'Possession Lv.4'!.]</p>
<p>After all, a reincarnator is a reincarnator.</p>
<p>In an instant, Nirvana's upper body, engulfed in lotus, began to regenerate rapidly.</p>
<p>By reviving part of their own story, their physical defects were restored.</p>
<p>Nearby, incarnations staggered and crawled towards Nirvana. They were the 'Salvationists' who followed them.</p>
<p>"Sect leader, I offer you my story."</p>
<p>"My story..."</p>
<p>Salvationists who suffered from [thought infection] volunteered to become sacrifices for the recovery of Nirvana.</p>
<p>Nirvana, lightly holding their hands, nodded his head.</p>
<p>"I will remember your story."</p>
<p>That was the identity of the Salvation Church.</p>
<p>All believers are merely pawns to complete the 'ultimate story' pursued by Nirvana.</p>
<p>Nirvana, having regained their strength, took a deep breath and opened their mouth.</p>
<p>"You are really strong in this round. It will be more rewarding to become one."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"I'm already looking forward to seeing what amazing stories you've built up... Wait a minute! Aren't I speaking to you! Kaaaaaaah!"</p>
<p>I asked Kim Dokja as I saw Nirvana starting to get beaten up as soon as they recovered.</p>
<p>'How much time is left now? They won't be able to last much longer.'</p>
<p>—5 minutes.</p>
<p>Nirvana, who was blocking Yoo Joonghyuk’s attack by spreading the palm of the Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara, shouted.</p>
<p>"Prophet! What are you doing? Help me quickly!"</p>
<p>"How can I help you?"</p>
<p>"I, become one with Yoo Joonghyuk— keaaaaaa!"</p>
<p>"Even if I die, I won’t become one with you!"</p>
<p>"Actually, I have no desire to become one with you!"</p>
<p>Nirvana, who had been hit dozens more times in that short period of time, said as their blood flowed.</p>
<p>"I don’t think that’s possible. I don’t want to further damage the body that will become one with me."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute! Nirvana, you—"</p>
<p>At the same time, the dark power of the story flowed from Nirvana's whole body.</p>
<p>—Looks like that bastard will end up using it.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja already seemed to know what technique he would use.</p>
<p>Of course, so did I and Anna Croft.</p>
<p>"Cheon Inho. We must stop it. The reincarnator will use [Eternal Nightmare]."</p>
<p>[Eternal Nightmare.]</p>
<p>In the 3rd round in Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, Yoo Joonghyuk fell victim to that technique.</p>
<p>"Right now, Yoo Joonghyuk has activated two story imprints and is in a state of insanity. In such a situation, if he were to receive that stigmata—"</p>
<p>"He’ll go crazy."</p>
<p>"I know. If we don’t stop it now—"</p>
<p>But even before we could move, Nirvana’s skill was already activated.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk. I don’t know why you looked like that."</p>
<p>The nightmare of eons resided in the white-stained fingertips of this guy.</p>
<p>"It doesn’t matter what you look like now. I can be anything. Man, woman, animal, monster! Only I can understand your eternity!"</p>
<p>Nirvana's hand stretched out like a sword and touched Yoo Joonghyuk’s forehead.</p>
<p>"So you too will understand me."</p>
<p>And like magic, Yoo Joonghyuk’s movements stopped.</p>
<p>Nirvana became proud and burst into laughter.</p>
<p>"Hahahaha! Yoo Joonghyuk! Finally—"</p>
<p>Slowly, Yoo Joonghyuk’s eyes turned towards Nirvana.</p>
<p>"Yoo Jong—"</p>
<p>With a fluttering sound, one of Nirvana's arms flew through the air.</p>
<p>"Uh?"</p>
<p>The moment Nirvana made a stupid expression, their other arm also flew in the air.</p>
<p>"Kaaaaaaak!"</p>
<p>The pain came late. Nirvana, whose arms were torn off in an instant, let out a desperate scream.</p>
<p>Anna Croft, shocked, staggered back.</p>
<p>I said, sighing inwardly.</p>
<p>'As expected, it doesn't work for the current Yoo Joonghyuk.'</p>
<p>—Yes.</p>
<p>[Eternal Nightmare is a technique that brings up the opponent's most terrible memories and traps them in those memories.]</p>
<p>But what if the 'opponent' is a beast with only instinct left?</p>
<p>"Oh, how!"</p>
<p>For example, if your mind has become so stupid that you cannot recall any memories.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk! Come to your senses! Your present—"</p>
<p>Nirvana's left leg was crushed with a loud sound.</p>
<p>"Kaaaaaaak!"</p>
<p>A spark of probability flew once again. An ecstatic Nirvana crawled on the floor on their haunches.</p>
<p>The black beast trampled on Nirvana's body and slowly looked around him.</p>
<p>King.</p>
<p>The man who suited that nickname better than anyone else cried out to the world.</p>
<p>And with that one howl, all the incarnations here realized.</p>
<p>[All incarnations of the 'Washington Dome' are terrified.]</p>
<p>No volcano in the world can call itself 'king' in front of that monster.</p>
<p>[The scales of probability are moving.]</p>
<p>As long as it is 'incarnation'.</p>
<p>—Youngest.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>Even though Yoo Joonghyuk is showing off such a powerful personality, the probability of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; did not stop him.</p>
<p>That said, the probability of this scenario is—</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Incitement Lv.10' is activated.]</p>
<p>It means allowing the emergence of a strong person to stop that 'overlord'.</p>
<p>[The third stage of 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is activated.]</p>
<p>Now it was the 'Demon king’s' turn to step forward.</p>
