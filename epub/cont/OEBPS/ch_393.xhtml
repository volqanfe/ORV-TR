<hr/>
<p>Her silence was soon a confirmation.</p>
<p>As expected, she was an Outer God, intent on destroying this Star Stream.</p>
<p>"Do you think it's a proper conclusion for you to be the first to yearn for that world, just because your disciple will despair of it?"</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Sword Saint looked at me silently and then withdrew.</p>
<p>"Do you think this world is worth protecting? Do you believe that the &lt;Star Stream&gt;, which uses all existence as mere material for narrative, is still worth continuing?"</p>
<p>Kim Dokja once said something similar. When Anna Croft asked if he, too, was fighting to protect this world, Kim Dokja replied,</p>
<p>"We'll have to wait and see whether this world is truly worth protecting."</p>
<p>But even Kim Dokja ultimately chose not to destroy the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p>Neither the gawking of the Constellations nor the cruelty of the scenarios were reasons to destroy this world.</p>
<p>Perhaps Kim Dokja had concluded: despite all the tragedy, this world was worth preserving. Even in a world where aspirations were firmly established, meaning still existed.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Accepting tragedy.</p>
<p>"Because this damned world exists, so does your disciple."</p>
<p>Calmly reading the already written sentences and moving forward.</p>
<p>"And that world, that guy never gave up on it."</p>
<p>In some worldline, Yoo Joonghyuk might have given up on his mission. Han Sooyoung is telling the story. She might not have continued writing, and Kim Dokja might not have been interested in 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p>But at least in the worldline I know, things were different.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung wrote 'Ways of Survival', Kim Dokja read it, and Yoo Joonghyuk lived his life to the end.</p>
<p>There were Constellations who loved that story. The faint starlight gathered to reveal the ending, and a story that didn't exist in the original was born.</p>
<p>Perhaps the laws of this universe can change just a little bit like that. I believe in that possibility.</p>
<p>"Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. Stop the expansion of the tree. Your disciple is not as weak as you think."</p>
<p>Facing the radiant Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's 'Mirror Vision', I continued my story.</p>
<p>"Do not destroy the &lt;Star Stream&gt;. If you completely become a Fear, you will lose your sense of self. Having lost your sense of self, you will lose control of the world to the nebulae, and ultimately, this forest will become a playground for the Constellations. The scenario won't end with 'a single justice', as you think."</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Sword Saint must know this. The ending she desires won't come. In this world, where everything, as she always does, becomes the subject of a story, even her justice is merely part of the story.</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Sword Saint raised her head and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>"The Constellations are gathering outside the forest."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>The Constellations' intentions were clear. They would uproot this giant tree, beyond their control. They would then take it to the higher scenarios and use it as a breakwater for the great apocalypse.</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid of the Constellations."</p>
<p>I've already seen the end of worldlines several times. I've seen the endings Kim Dokja showed, Cheon Inho showed, and Han Sooyoung showed.</p>
<p>I know the new school Constellations are powerful. I know how distant the stories that drive them are, and how foolish it is to fight against them.</p>
<p>But in the 1,863rd round, the Apocalypse Dragon appeared. Even when I descended, and when Yoo Joonghyuk died in the 40th round, everyone said the same thing: this story is over. But neither Han Sooyoung nor Cheon Inho gave up, and they reached a conclusion even Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't see.</p>
<p>"If you don't give up, you can definitely fight back."</p>
<p>Instead of answering my words, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint gazed silently at the winter sky. A faint crack of light was forming across the pitch-black night. The Constellations were attempting to infiltrate this 'tree'.</p>
<p>[Sad Recorder of the stars.]</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's Mirror Vision Eyes looked at me, and I looked back at her. Our story resonated, and the surrounding scenery began to change.</p>
<p>[I ask you if you have the strength to prove your justice.]</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's manor vanished. The expansive veranda vanished. The barking cries of the Breaking the Sky Sword Master and Yoo Joonghyuk's swordsmanship slicing through the air dispersed.</p>
<p>What unfolded before me was a bloody battlefield. I knew this stage well.</p>
<p>「This was the 'final battle site' of the second round’s Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.」</p>
<p>I saw the returnees lying on the ground. Martial arts practitioners who had returned from other worlds. Those who had gained strength from other worlds and descended as disasters to seek revenge on this 'Murim'.</p>
<p>「Returnee War.」</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Sword Saint had single-handedly prevented disaster here and protected Murim.</p>
<p>A powerful aura emanated from Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's body. I could feel the power of an Outer being enveloping her entire being.</p>
<p>[Natural Disaster-level Fear, 'Impossible Justice', is watching you.]</p>
<p>It felt like staring into an endless abyss. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint standing before me was the same being who had emerged from the bushes earlier and blocked Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>[What is your justice?]</p>
<p>A golden aura rippled from her hand, then took the form of a sword.</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Divine Sword.</p>
<p>Since no metal in this Murim could fully withstand her story, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint had forged her own story to create a sword. She said.</p>
<p>「A sword abandoned to cut down the stars in the sky.」</p>
<p>Later, the Meteor Shower, created by Yoo Joonghyuk, also applied the supernatural power of the Breaking the Sky God.</p>
<p>To counter the immense fighting spirit emanating from her body, I, too, drew up my magical power. The flowing magical power naturally blended with my mantra.</p>
<p>[My justice is.]</p>
<p>As I slowly inhaled, the story within me began to speak.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>This forest grants strength to those who uphold their principles. Therefore, I, too, must have a duty to prove my principles here.</p>
<p>「What is my justice?」</p>
<p>I lack the upright convictions of Kim Dokja, the grand ambitions of Han Sooyoung, or the tenacious persistence of Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>[My justice is—]</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even I, like you, have a vision I long to see.</p>
<p>[A world where Yoo Joonghyuk can eat 'dumplings made by others' with peace of mind.]</p>
<p>The flying Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. Slashing her blade with all my might, I continued my mantra.</p>
<p>[People who love one person's story—living together in the 'Big House' they desire.]</p>
<p>'Unbreakable Faith' shone brightly. The giant story contained in the swordplay was pushing back the power of the outside world.</p>
<p>[It's to ensure that those who still refuse to give up on their stories—won't be saddened by their story's ending.]</p>
<p>[Your 'giant story' responds to your will.]</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung said. The 'Giant Story' I possess responds to the 'story I want to write'.</p>
<p>Perhaps, on the day this 'Giant Story' becomes a 'Super Giant Story', the world I long to see will also meet its end.</p>
<p>Kagagagagak!</p>
<p>We exchanged sword strikes in silence. Despite the help of the 'Giant Story', I was slowly falling behind. This was partly because my proficiency in the 'Giant Story' wasn't high, and partly because Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, who had become a 'Outer God', was an entity outside the standard.</p>
<p>Within this 'forest', her status was... A level approaching Mythical.</p>
<p>Having been devoured by the stories, unable to smoothly activate either the 'Demon King of Salvation' or the 'King of Fear' mode, she was an unbeatable opponent for me.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I persisted and swung my sword because I knew from the start she wouldn't harm me.</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.</p>
<p>Great Move.</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Meteor Shower.</p>
<p>A meteor shower, destined to knock down the stars, descended upon me. I used [Way of the Wind] to dodge the trajectories and advance forward.</p>
<p>「To write and read this 'world' presented before me to the end.」</p>
<p>At present, I can neither freely wield the stories of the 'Demon King of Salvation' nor the power of the 'King of Fear'. But even I, a mere mortal, can do something.</p>
<p>「"Believe in the stories you've built. What you've experienced is who you are. Your job is to give meaning to that story, to give it a name."」</p>
<p>This was the power of the stories I had purely accumulated.</p>
<p>With the overflowing energy of the 'Giant Tale', [Bookmark] and [Incite] simultaneously activated in my mind.</p>
<p>「"I am 'Kyrgios Roadgrime'."」</p>
<p>I saw Breaking the Sky Sword Saint hesitate for a moment as she confirmed the lightening of [Electrification] surging through my body.</p>
<p>[That ability—]</p>
<p>For a moment, I became electric, retracing the Meteor Shower's trajectory and arriving right in front of Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. The moment her eyes widened, 'Unbreakable Faith' stirred. [Way of the Wind] exploded like a howling wolf, and the electric wave of [Baekcheong-ganggi] pierced through the gap created by the explosion.</p>
<p>The blades pierced like solid fangs. Something ripped deeply, and only after passing Breaking the Sky Sword Saint a dozen steps did I finally stop. As hhe power of [Electrification] dispersed, a faint sense of exhaustion washed over me.</p>
<p>When I turned around, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was still standing tall. Silvery wisps of light were fluttering before her.</p>
<p>[Who taught you this technique?]</p>
<p>This technique, a fusion of the powers of [Way of the Wind] and [Electrification], was something I mastered while studying under Han Sooyoung in the 1,863rd round.</p>
<p>「Wind Wolf Slash and White Wolf Slash.」</p>
<p>[I learned it from everyone I met.]</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Sword Saint seemed to ponder something for a while after hearing my answer, then said,</p>
<p>[I have seen your justice.]</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Sword Saint slowly turned, her wounds already healed. Wind Wolf Slash and White Wolf Slash were techniques I had practiced to cut down even the most stellar Constellations with a single stroke, but as expected, they were no match for Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.</p>
<p>A lump in my throat twitched as I watched Breaking the Sky Sword Saint slowly approach. In the end, I wondered if I should use the story of the 'King of Fear'.</p>
<p>[Stand back, young Recorder.]</p>
<p>As Breaking the Sky Sword Saint uttered her mantra, a single flash of light pierced the sky. Breaking the Sky Sword Saint swung her sword toward the sky as if protecting me. Breaking the Sky Divine Sword, which had deflected the flash, let out a soft sword sound.</p>
<p>Frowning, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint raised her head and saw Murim’s sky shatter like broken glass. Constellations emerged from the cracks of scattered light.</p>
<p>[Found it.]</p>
<p>They were Constellations I knew well.</p>
<p>I'd clearly seen the stories swallowed by the tree, but it seemed only a small number were destroyed that way.</p>
<p>The number of Constellations appearing on the battlefield easily exceeded three hundred.</p>
<p>[The possibility of a 'Giant Story' is stirring in the scenario.]</p>
<p>A battlefield so large that the likelihood of a 'Giant Tale' scenario was building.</p>
<p>The three Constellations that occupied its center were the aforementioned three.</p>
<p>[This is our chance to seize the core of the World Tree.]</p>
<p>Apollo, Vidar, and Halla.</p>
<p>The three Constellations, having taken my brother's story and reached the border of Mythical Constellations, radiated a bright light, glaring at me and Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.</p>
<p>Apollo glared coldly at me, then turned to Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and commanded the Constellations.</p>
<p>[Take care of them.]</p>
<p>The Five Hundred Generals of &lt;Tamra&gt; moved. Each of them was enough to cause disaster to a small planet. They were all simultaneously revealing their power to Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.</p>
<p>The first Constellation to land on the ground roared and swung their massive spear at Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Sword Saint gazed at the Constellations with indifferent eyes and opened her mouth.</p>
<p>[With such a mere justice.]</p>
<p>The Constellation's spear shattered like a toy.</p>
<p>[You intend to face me?]</p>
<p>The moment the general's eyes widened, his neck was already flying through the air. It was a speed too fast for the naked eye to detect.</p>
<p>「Breaking the Sky Sword Saint hasn't been using her full strength until now.」</p>
<p>I had a vague sense of it, but even so, the goosebumps on the back of my neck wouldn't stop. The true power of a Natural Disaster-level Fear was awakening within Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's entire body.</p>
<p>[Don't back down! That bastard—]</p>
<p>Before he could even utter his mantra, the Constellation was torn in two. No one could block her sword.</p>
<p>「Why does the 'First Murim' worship the 'Breaking the Sky Sword Saint' as a god?」</p>
<p>The answer was right before my eyes.</p>
<p>Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, transformed into an Outer God and the very embodiment of fear, had finally become Fear itself, achieving the stranglehold of the stars she had longed for.</p>
<p>[Did you really intend to listen to my story with such a justice?]</p>
<p>With each swing of the sword, the stars in the sky went out one by one. Stars that had lost their lore crumbled and shattered, and the terrified Five Hundred Generals retreated, unable to hide their shock.</p>
<p>「They chose the wrong battlefield.」</p>
<p>This is the world of Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.</p>
<p>Unless even a Myth-level Constellation descends, there's no way to deal with her.</p>
<p>Currently, there are no Myth-level Constellations in the Great Nebula to dispatch here.</p>
<p>[Ah, Apollo! Vidar!]</p>
<p>[Kuaaaaak! Get out of the way!]</p>
<p>Common sense dictated that Apollo, Vidar, and Halla should have acknowledged their shortcomings and retreated.</p>
<p>But they did not retreat.</p>
<p>[It's true that some 'Fears' are comparable to 'Myth-level' ones.]</p>
<p>With a seemingly intriguing remark, Apollo from the sky landed on the ground. Halla and Vidar followed.</p>
<p>Apollon opened his mouth with a faint smile.</p>
<p>[I have a gift prepared for you, foolish forest god.]</p>
<p>A faint sound, like a scream, could be heard from afar. Listening closely, I realized it was a story.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Returnee War', begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>A trembling, sorrowful story. The moment I realized the story's true identity, goosebumps ran down my spine.</p>
<p>At that moment, I realized where I was. This was the final stage of the second round. The final battlefield of Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.</p>
<p>「Breaking the Sky Sword Saint of the second round will die here, under the combined attack of the Heavenly Demon and the Blood Demon.」</p>
<p>['Staging' begins!]</p>
