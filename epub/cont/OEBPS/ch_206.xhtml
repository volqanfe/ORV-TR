<hr/>
<p>Why on earth is kkoma Kim Dokja here?</p>
<p>"I’m glad that everyone likes him."</p>
<p>When I turned my head, I saw Lee Jihye playing the Hwipirang. Even her facial expression was different from the younger Lee Jihye in the 41st Round.</p>
<p>Lee Jihye of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; overcomes all her scenarios and eventually overcomes even her own sponsor to become the 'Monarch of the Sea'.</p>
<p>"I worked hard to collect your fragments."</p>
<p>「Through Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, her inner thoughts were heard at times.」</p>
<p>[Your understanding of the person in question is insufficient.]</p>
<p>Even though I couldn't hear it completely, it was enough to understand the situation.</p>
<p>「In addition to the 41st Round, there was a universe where 'Kim Dokja fragments' were scattered.」</p>
<p>And Lee Jihye seems to have collected the 'Kim Dokja fragments' scattered throughout that universe.</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' finds it appetizing.]</p>
<p>Perhaps this 'kkoma Kim Dokja' is a kind of artificial life form created from the fragments of Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>Crucially, this 'kkoma Kim Dokja' could  be felt as a soul. That's probably why I was able to possess it.</p>
<p>The child who was lightly patting my cheek muttered.</p>
<p>"Did you look like this when you were young?"</p>
<p>"You were cute when you were young."</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung and Lee Gilyoung.</p>
<p>I slowly looked at their faces.</p>
<p>In reality, it was my first time seeing these faces, but the feeling of familiarity was probably because I had already met Shin Yoosoung in the 41st Round.</p>
<p>"If you say one word, I will kill you all."</p>
<p>No, maybe I had also met 'Shin Yoosoung' before my eyes.</p>
<p>「"You're Kim Dokja."」</p>
<p>This girl possessed herself in the 41st Round and saved me several times.</p>
<p>I carefully held the hand of the girl who was squeezing mine. It was only a subtle level of grip strength, but even with that, Shin Yoosoung could sense something on my face.</p>
<p>"What."</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, who had been looking at me blankly, suddenly tilted her head.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi?"</p>
<p>Lee Seolhwa, who was watching the situation from afar, approached.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Is it an illusion... I think the little man’s condition has just changed."</p>
<p>In response to Shin Yoosoung's words, Lee Seolhwa pulled up my top and took the stethoscope.</p>
<p>"Well, let’s see."</p>
<p>Doctor Lee Seolhwa.</p>
<p>A person who looks almost no different from the 41st Round just by face alone. The difference was the depth of her expression.</p>
<p>Lee Seolhwa in the 41st Round had a strangely strong spirit of experimentation, while Lee Seolhwa in &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; had the air of a seeker who was well versed in all the truths of the universe.</p>
<p>Lee Seolhwa’s eyes met mine and drew a soft arc.</p>
<p>"The story’s condition is stable."</p>
<p>A doctor who steadfastly took care of the group even in places where Kim Dokja's eyes could not reach.</p>
<p>As Kim Dokja expressed, without her, &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; would not have been able to reach the final scenario.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung urgently grabbed my hand and comforted me.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi, can you hear me?"</p>
<p>" Shin Yoosoung, don’t bother the kkoma Dokja too much."</p>
<p>"I didn’t mean to bother him."</p>
<p>A gentle hand stroking my head. Yoo Sangah was looking down at me with her characteristic faint smile.</p>
<p>As I looked at her smile, it occurred to me that Kim Dokja's story did not fully describe her.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was natural.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja's mind is filled with the 'Ways of Survival', and the criteria for judgment are also within the 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p>「The look is enough to slap Yoo Joonghyuk three times in the face.」</p>
<p>If we were to apply the standards of 'Ways of Survival', Yoo Sangah was definitely a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Is it just how she looks? Her warm heart and warm consideration... But haven’t I been talking only about Yoo Sangah since a while ago?</p>
<p>[The story fragment 'Kim Dokja who respects Yoo Sangah' continues its storytelling.]</p>
<p>It was somehow strange.</p>
<p>I guess this was the core story that made up 'kkoma Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p>"But doesn’t that seem really dangerous?"</p>
<p>Lee Jihye, who was looking at the display screen, said something.</p>
<p>"What if they really die like that?"</p>
<p>On the screen, Ji Eunyu and Cha Yerin were still struggling to drive the carriage. As I was caught up in the shocking situation, I forgot about the people I was supposed to protect.</p>
<p>Now was the time to unlock [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint].</p>
<p>[A temporary error occurs in this skill.]</p>
<p>[You cannot release 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' level 3.]</p>
<p>Shit. What is it again this time?</p>
<p>I became impatient.</p>
<p>On the screen, we saw enemies attacking the carriage we were riding in. Ji Eunyu and Cha Yerin are strong, but the situation is difficult with just the two of them.</p>
<p>If I don't go right now—</p>
<p>"Do you want me to possess my past self again?"</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung frowned at Shin Yoosoung’s question.</p>
<p>"Shin Yoosoung, have you already forgotten that you suffered a probability aftermath before?"</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>"It would be better if I logged in as a Constellation and used 'Deus Ex Machina'—"</p>
<p>"Don’t be stupid. That’s a place where outside Constellations can’t intervene."</p>
<p>"Then why not just descend directly?"</p>
<p>"Didn’t you hear that descending was prohibited? If you did something like that—"</p>
<p>"The sooty bastard descended."</p>
<p>"That’s because Joonghyuk ahjussi—"</p>
<p>"Why can the sooty bastard do it and I can’t?"</p>
<p>While Yoo Sangah, who was worse off, was trying to stop the two children, Lee Jihye looked at me this time and asked.</p>
<p>"Kkoma, what do you think? Help me with that? Or not? I think I can just secretly go and use [Intant Kill] once."</p>
<p>My heart was beating slowly.</p>
<p>I know it's just words. Because Lee Jihye doesn’t know that I am now possessing this 'kkoma Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p>Still, I had a hard time shaking off the temptation of those words.</p>
<p>「If only I could get help from &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;.」</p>
<p>I thought of Ji Eunyu, Cha Yerin, Killer King Cha Sungwoo, Dansu ahjussi, and Kyung Sein's faces one after another.</p>
<p>If we can get help from &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;, we may be able to guarantee the safety of the party.</p>
<p>We will no longer have to face death scenarios.</p>
<p>I moved my hand slowly.</p>
<p>I was going to tell Lee Jihye. Please help, please help my companions not die— But at that moment, a light spark struck my head.</p>
<p>「"Why did you want to become a writer?"」</p>
<p>Distorted sentences appeared on Han Sooyoung’s dying face.</p>
<p>「If we receive help from Kim Dokja Company here, whose story is it?」</p>
<p>While I was breathing hard and blinking my eyes, Lee Jihye turned her head again and looked at her screen.</p>
<p>「"I’ll drive. Can you take care of the carriage behind me?"」</p>
<p>「"I heard Yerin-ssi is a minor."」</p>
<p>「"Yes, but I really wanted to try driving at least once."」</p>
<p>The carriage on the screen accelerated with a roar.</p>
<p>The group watched the accelerating carriage in silence.</p>
<p>「"Then I’ll leave it to you for a moment. Yerin, have you ever played a car game?"」</p>
<p>「"I’ve never tried it, but I think I can try it!"」</p>
<p>「"Okay. Every game has rules, so let's follow them. I'll take care of the carriage that follows, Yerin—"」</p>
<p>Just as the Constellations once watched their story. Just as Kim Dokja read Yoo Joonghyuk's story. &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; silently watched our story.</p>
<p>"That person over there somehow looks like Sangah-ssi."</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung said something.</p>
<p>"She’s pretty good. It’s not as good as ours."</p>
<p>Lee Gilyoung, who seems to be entering puberty, also left a comment. The companions smiled faintly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ji Eunyu blocked the attack of another carriage and overturned two carriages approaching from both sides.</p>
<p>Yoo Sangah nodded her head.</p>
<p>"She’s a good fighter."</p>
<p>"We fought like that too. Do you remember? Back then—"</p>
<p>The carriage ran away. A carriage that is neither Apollo's golden chariot nor Surya's train. Nevertheless, I knew what story my companions were seeing through that carriage.</p>
<p>「I miss you.」</p>
<p>As I listened to the sentence, where I couldn't tell who was thinking, I felt like my heart was breaking for some reason.</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; was located here.</p>
<p>Even after their story was over, they remained here and missed the story. As I read the stories of myself and my companions, I was thinking about one person for a long time.</p>
<p>「I miss you.」</p>
<p>How long did they remember those years before a person's name finally became their life?</p>
<p>Looking up at their faces, for the first time, I lost confidence in what I was about to do.</p>
<p>「I was thinking of changing the ending of the 41st Round.」</p>
<p>What would happen to these people if I changed the fixed world line?</p>
<p>If the ending of the 41st Round is changed, will &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;, which was born from that ending, be safe?</p>
<p>Will the probability of this world allow their longing?</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja!"</p>
<p>The group turned around at the same time at the loud, energetic tone.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk was there.</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja!"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk was walking around with a serious expression, calling out Kim Dokja's name.</p>
<p>Lee Jihye, who was observing Yoo Joonghyuk, asked.</p>
<p>"You said you fought with Master Odin, right? Did you hit your head wrongly?"</p>
<p>In the end, Yoo Sangah, who was worse off, approached Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>"Joonghyuk-ssi. What’s going on?"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk glared at Yoo Sangah for a moment, then began to look at the surrounding space with a bewildered look.</p>
<p>About ten seconds like that.</p>
<p>"There was Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"No, Kim Dokja has come."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk said as if he was frustrated.</p>
<p>"It means that 'Kim Dokja' is here now."</p>
<p>"huh? But Dokja-ssi—"</p>
<p>Yoo Sangah, who had been talking up to that point, turned her gaze towards me.</p>
<p>Yoo Sangah’s eyes slowly grew bigger.</p>
<p>It was almost at the same time that Yoo Joonghyuk discovered me.</p>
<p>This was the first time I knew [Red Phoenix Shunpo] was that good and fast of a skill. When I came to my senses, I was hanging in the air with Yoo Joonghyuk's hand holding my ankle.</p>
<p>"No, Master! What should I do if I hear you say that!"</p>
<p>"What is this?"</p>
<p>"These are the fragments of ahjussi that I collected. Handle them carefully! They may break!"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk’s harsh eyes glared at me.</p>
<p>I imagined turning off [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] several times in my head.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk said.</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>"Master, that’s not him. The real ahjussi is in there right now—"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk looked at the screen pointed to by Lee Jihye.</p>
<p>Inside was my figure, stretched out like a squid and bouncing around in a rickety carriage.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk looked back and forth between me and me on the screen with confused eyes.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute. The guy over there… he’s passed out just now, right?"</p>
<p>It was then that Shin Yoosoung opened her mouth.</p>
<p>"A skill used every time my ahjussi faints."</p>
<p>"No way—"</p>
<p>One by one, the eyes of my companions turn to me gathered together.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, Yoo Sangah, Shin Yoosoung, Lee Gilyoung, Lee Seolhwa, and Lee Jihye.</p>
<p>The gathered group looked at each other with nervous eyes.</p>
<p>"Joonghyuk-ssi, are you sure? Did you sense Dokja-ssi’s presence?"</p>
<p>"That guy has a unique eerie feeling."</p>
<p>"What do you think, what does the sooty bastard know?"</p>
<p>"Can you feel him here now?"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, who held me with his vicious hand, glared at me once again.</p>
<p>And after a while, Yoo Joonghyuk's head moved slightly.</p>
<p>The next moment, an eerie silence swept over the surroundings.</p>
<p>The group members looked at each other's faces and nodded at the same time.</p>
<p>"Let’s lock him up."</p>
