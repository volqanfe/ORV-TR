<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">561 Episode 2. Rewrite (6)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>A giant holographic screen appeared in the center of the subway station.</p>
<p>People screamed in surprise.</p>
<p>The screen showed a classroom.</p>
<p>Shaking girls in navy blue school uniforms.</p>
<p>It was a scene I recognized.</p>
<p>「Daepong Girls' High School.」</p>
<p>The girls on the screen were working together to break down the classroom door.</p>
<p>Of course, their efforts will fail, because this is such a story.</p>
<p>An ominous beep, beep, beep, beepᅳ</p>
<p>The girls screamed.</p>
<p>[The given time has run out.]</p>
<p>[Paid settlement will begin.]</p>
<p>With the announcement, the girls' heads began to explode one by one.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and stared at the scene. I had a responsibility to see the story through to the end.</p>
<p>On the screen, the last remaining girl clutched her friend's throat.</p>
<p>A choked groan.</p>
<p>Then the only survivor on the screen looked around.</p>
<p>[#Bay23515 channel. Daepong Girls' High School, Year 2 Class B Survivor: Lee Jihye.]</p>
<p>The exact same development as 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<p>Lee Jihye, who was glaring at the screen, disappeared and Bihyung laughed.</p>
<p>[How about it. It's funny, right?]</p>
<p>"H-how—"</p>
<p>The people in the room froze in horror.</p>
<p>Even the big guy was quite surprised, and the eyes of the reader ahjussi, who probably already knew the story, were shaking.</p>
<p>I was the only one who didn't panic.</p>
<p>[The character 'Lee Hyunjoo' is freaking out!]</p>
<p>[The character 'Yeom Baekhoon' is freaking out!]</p>
<p>Psychological messages from characters were coming from all over the place.</p>
<p>Bihyung touched the exact spot where people's anxiety was coming from and disappeared again.</p>
<p>"T-the kid who survived at the end. She must have killed someone."</p>
<p>Someone muttered as if possessed.</p>
<p>The chorus of voices around him spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>"Are we wrong? What if the germs aren't the answer?"</p>
<p>"Are you sure you know what you're talking about? Are you sure we can survive?"</p>
<p>I had to appease them somehow.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute. Can you all calm down?"</p>
<p>"How are we supposed to calm down now?"</p>
<p>The excited people shouted at me.</p>
<p>The reader ahjussi, who had been watching the situation from the sidelines, stepped forward to dissuade them.</p>
<p>"We don't know the outcome yet, do we? This guy wants to save you all too, so come on—"</p>
<p>"The problem is that we don't know the outcome! If we're wrong, we're screwed!"</p>
<p>"You're the same! You two are friends, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"We're all going to die now because of you, what are we going to do!"</p>
<p>In an instant, the people surrounding us were ready to lynch us. There was also the big guy in the middle of the crowd, smiling with satisfaction.</p>
<p>When I first set up this plan, I knew this would be a crisis point.</p>
<p>I also had a plan for this moment.</p>
<p>[There are 9 minutes remaining.]</p>
<p>But then I got tired.</p>
<p>I wondered if it would be wiser to just run away with the ahjussi and kill the nine minutes.</p>
<p>With these cowardly thoughts running through my mind, I searched the subway for a suitable</p>
<p>hiding place.</p>
<p>As soon as I did that.</p>
<p>[The character 'Kim Cheolyang' is looking at you.]</p>
<p>[The character 'Kim Cheolyang' wants to do something unexpected.]</p>
<p>A message rang in your head.</p>
<p>[The activation conditions for the exclusive skill '■■' has been met.]</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill '■■' has been activated.]</p>
<p>......■■?</p>
<p>[The character 'Kim Cheolyang's attribute is preparing to bloom.]</p>
<p>[You can interfere with character 'Kim Cheolyang's attribute blooming.]</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill '■■' is activated!]</p>
<p>The scenery around me turned colorless, and people's actions slowed down drastically.</p>
<p>I, too, stiffened and stopped moving.</p>
<p>In a world where time had stopped, only the letters floated in the colorless background.</p>
<p>「Lee Hyekyung thought, 'It's all because of him.'」</p>
<p>「Kim Haemoon thought, 'I'm being punished by heaven for killing a bug.'」</p>
<p>「Ji Hyungdong didn't like those narrow eyes from the beginning.」</p>
<p>When I looked closely, there was another sentence floating above my head.</p>
<p>「And Lee Hakhyun realized what the skill was.」</p>
<p>Then a message appeared in the white space in front of me.</p>
<p>[You have entered the 'Snowfield'.]</p>
<p>[Describe the next action of 'Kim Cheolyang'.]</p>
<fieldset>
<p># Kim Cheolyang's Awakening</p>
<br/>
<p>Cheolyang■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■</p>
<p>* At your current skill level, you can write a total of 150 additional characters.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Spaces that emerged like unfinished manuscripts.</p>
<p>It wasn't hard to understand what those blanks were.</p>
<p>[You can stay in the 'Snowfield (雪源)' for a total of 3 minutes.]</p>
<p>Just as Kim Dokja had a 'reader' skill, I had a 'writer' skill.</p>
<p>Skill '■■'.</p>
<p>Will what I write come true?</p>
<p>Since I didn't have much time, I decided to write a sentence in the blank first. The purpose was clear.</p>
<p>Use Kim Cheolyang to save me and the ahjussi from the crisis.</p>
<p>As I concentrated, the sentences flowed out of my head.</p>
<p>It was natural.</p>
<p>I'm Omniscient Reader's author.</p>
<p>「At that moment, an unknown loyalty sprang up inside of Kim Cheolyang for the man with the narrow eyes¹ This loyalty soon awakened him.]</p>
<a href="#note1" epub:type="noteref">[NOTE 1]</a><p>[The character 'Kim Cheolyang' evolves into 'Judge of Destruction'.]</p>
<p>"Stop. Don't touch him." (149 characters in total)」</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>At a glance, it was a perfect development.</p>
<p>Using the fact that his attribute is 'Crouching Figure', I evolved Kim Cheolyang into a 'Judge of Destruction' like Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, it's an excellent double-entendre.</p>
<p>[This story is ridiculous.]</p>
<p>[This story's reproduction success rate is 1%.]</p>
<p>[You're running out of probability.]</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>[Do you want to check the reader's feedback?]</p>
<p>I nodded in agreement.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>rlaehrwk37: I'm getting off</p>
</fieldset>
<p>I stood dumbfounded for a moment, then regained my composure. Now was not the time to be shocked.</p>
<p>I resumed writing my sentence.</p>
<p>「At that moment, Kim Cheolyang realized that he was actually a martial arts master in his previous life........ (147 characters in total)」</p>
<p>[This story is impossible.]</p>
<p>[This story's reproduction success rate is 0.1%.]</p>
<p>[You're running out of probability.]</p>
<p>[Do you want to check the reader's feedback?]</p>
<fieldset>
<p>rlaehrwk37: I'm getting off</p>
</fieldset>
<p>「At that moment, Kim Cheolyang realized that he was Kim Namwoon's cousin. The unknown affection towards his own blood that flowed from him....... (143 characters in total)」</p>
<p>[This story is bizarre.]</p>
<p>[This story's reproduction success rate is 3%.]</p>
<p>[You're running out of probability.]</p>
<p>[Do you want to check the reader's feedback?]</p>
<fieldset>
<p>rlaehrwk37: Do you want to die?</p>
</fieldset>
<p>I wrote a couple more times like that with no luck.</p>
<p>After taking one comment punch after another, I was mentally exhausted.</p>
<p>[There are 30 seconds remaining.]</p>
<p>I started to feel self-deprecating. I couldn't think of anything to write or how to write it.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, watching the time tick away in real time.</p>
<p>It's times like these that I need to go back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>「"Author-nim."」</p>
<p>Then I heard the voice of the dokkaebi Ji Eunyoo in my head.</p>
<p>「"What does this character want?"」</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>[There are 20 seconds remaining.]</p>
<p>[The exclusive attribute is in effect!]</p>
<p>I thought about Kim Cheolyang, a character who existed only as a setting.</p>
<p>[There are 15 seconds remaining.]</p>
<p>How he would act in this situation, what he would say, what he would want to be.</p>
<p>Just like the day I first wrote 'Omniscient Reader', I frantically wrote sentences.</p>
<p>I spoke as Kim Cheolyang and acted as Kim Cheolyang.</p>
<p>At that moment, I was Kim Cheolyang.</p>
<p>The moment I typed the last word.</p>
<p>[The time limit has expired.]</p>
<p>[This story is plausible.]</p>
<p>[This story's reproduction success rate is 90%.]</p>
<p>[There's enough probability.]</p>
<p>[Do you want to check the reader's feedback?]</p>
<fieldset>
<p>rlaehrwk37: Oh</p>
</fieldset>
<p>I don't know what that "oh" means, but at least it surprised the reader.</p>
<p>By the way, this asshole, I'll remembered your ID.</p>
<p>[Successfully recreating the scene.]</p>
<p>[Leaving the 'Snowfield'.]</p>
<p>I felt the power draining from my body, and the colors around me returned to normal.</p>
<p>The excited people came toward me and reader ahjussi and I could see the big guy come to us.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>"Everyone."</p>
<p>「At that moment, Kim Cheolyang stepped forward.」</p>
<p>The sentence I had written began to come to life.</p>
<p>"Our faith is being tested right now."</p>
<p>「Not anyone could do it. But the moment he stepped forward, he was seized with an intense belief that he had been chosen by God.」</p>
<p>"Faith?"</p>
<p>「Maybe it was the fire. I could see the fire burning beyond their pupils.」</p>
<p>That's all I wrote. However, it was enough for an introduction.</p>
<p>According to [Character List], Kim Cheolyang sees this scenario as a test of faith.</p>
<p>"I'm sure you've all noticed by now that someone is watching us from the sky."</p>
<p>[The eyes of a few constellations light up.]</p>
<p>The crowd roared at the timely message.</p>
<p>Encouraged, Kim Cheolyang became more determined and shouted.</p>
<p>"The 'gods' are watching our choices, whether we choose justice or evil."</p>
<p>[Evolution of character 'Kim Cheolyang' is imminent!]</p>
<p>[The words of the character 'Kim Cheolyang' move people's hearts.]</p>
<p>"Think about it with common sense. The one who killed a human and cleared the scenario, and the one who cleared the scenario without killing anyone. Which one is more just, and who would the gods be rooting for?"</p>
<p>The listeners shook their heads. Some muttered, 'That's right' and 'murder is a big sin'.</p>
<p>Kim Cheolyang continued.</p>
<p>"The answer is set. We chose the right side, and the only thing left is our faith in ourselves. We even met a 'God's emissary' who knows the future."</p>
<p>God's emissary?</p>
<p>Kim Cheolyang, who suddenly stood up from his seat, pointed at me over the campfire.</p>
<p>"We listened to him and found a way to solve the challenge without anyone dying. We've already passed the ordeal."</p>
<p>That's a line I didn't mean him to say?</p>
<p>The moment Kim Cheolyang looked at me with passionate eyes, people also looked back at me.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>"Maybe the deacon is right. There's no way we'll be asked to kill human beings."</p>
<p>People started talking.</p>
<p>"Look at those kids in the video. They're all dead because they were trying to kill each other."</p>
<p>"People's lives are so precious!"</p>
<p>A life-threatening situation in an unrealistic scenario.</p>
<p>There's a god watching over them, and a religious person affirming and encouraging their choices.</p>
<p>Killing was scary, faith was close.</p>
<p>Survival, in which they all believed, was sweet.</p>
<p>Hope, which was powerless when they were separated, became a religion when a single event brought them together.</p>
<p>"Kim Cheolyang! Kim Cheolyang!"</p>
<p>"We were chosen, we were chosen......."</p>
<p>Someone cried out in excitement.</p>
<p>I could see reader ahjussi sighing lightly from the side.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks to the great work of the awakened Kim Cheolyang, the crisis for me and the ahjussi seemed to have passed safely.</p>
<p>But that wasn't the end of the story.</p>
<p>[The character 'Kim Cheolyang' has awakened the new attribute 'Cult Leader'.]</p>
<p>[The character 'Kim Cheolyang' has acquired a new religious view.]</p>
<p>[The character "Kim Cheolyang" has acquired the basic doctrine of the 'Life's Teachings'.]</p>
<p>Life's Teachings (生命敎).</p>
<p>The moment I heard the name, a chill ran down my spine.</p>
<p>One of the ten thousand notes in my head came back to me clearly.</p>
<p>「At that moment, Lee Hakhyun remembered exactly who 'Kim Cheolyang' was.」</p>
<p>[The character 'Kim Cheolyang' had accepted your 'view of life'.]</p>
<p>[You had a great influence on the establishment of the religious view.]</p>
<p>I realized what I had done.</p>
<p>The character Kim Cheolyang.</p>
<p>My first notes about him are as follows.</p>
<p>「From the Ten Evils (十惡), the Life Leader Kim Cheolyang.」</p>
<p>The Ten Evils, the worst villains of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>I just raised one of them with my own hands.</p>
