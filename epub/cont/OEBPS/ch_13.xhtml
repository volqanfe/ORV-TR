<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">565 Episode 3. Protagonist(?) (2)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>Wait. How many?</p>
<fieldset>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">&lt;Sponsor Selection&gt;</h3>
<p>—Please select your sponsor.</p>
<p>—Your chosen sponsor will be your strong supporter.</p>
<p>1. Monarch of the Small Fries</p>
<p>2. Dragon Lying Down</p>
<p>3. Sneaking Schemer</p>
<p>.......</p>
</fieldset>
<p>I blinked, dumbfounded.</p>
<p>This many people applied to be my sponsor?</p>
<p>Where did they get the word?</p>
<p>[The constellations are awaiting your choice.]</p>
<p>I coudn't tell. I guess we'll have to see who's here first.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who applied, and they may not be worthy.</p>
<p>First up is the 'Monarch of the Small Fries'.</p>
<p>I expected this one.</p>
<p>In Omniscient Reader, he was the sponsor behind the acting leader on Geumho Station, Bang Cheolsoo. After the beginning, he disappeared.</p>
<p>In other words, he was not worth considering.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is glaring at you.]</p>
<p>The second was the 'Dragon Lying Down'.</p>
<p>This one is the Crouching Dragon(臥龍), 'Zhu Ge Kong Ming'. He had excellent stats for a narrative-grade constellation.</p>
<p>He must have been impressed with my killing strategy, but unfortunately, I didn't plan on choosing him here.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Dragon Lying Down' is frowning.]</p>
<p>Next up is...... Huh?</p>
<p>For a moment, I thought I'd misread the modifier.</p>
<p>Third, the 'Sneaking Schemer'.</p>
<p>I thought it was 'Secretive Plotter'.</p>
<p>An imitation?</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I couldn't recall a constellation with this modifier.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' says he's very strong and you should choose him.]</p>
<p>The way he's talking, he's not even worthy of the modifier. I wonder if he's actually copying the 'Secretive Plotter'.</p>
<p>'Secretive Plotter' is an exceptional case, but as Kim Dokja says, it's unlikely that constellation with such a poor modifier is a strong one.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>4. Abyssal Black Flame Dragon</p>
</fieldset>
<p>I sucked in an involuntary breath.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' came after hearing rumors about you.]</p>
<p>Abyssal Black Flame Dragon.</p>
<p>The guy who was the sponsor behind the Black Flame Demon Ruler Han Sooyoung in Omniscient Reader, and one of the 'first four' of Bihyung's channel.</p>
<p>It's been a long time since I've seen that modifier.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' tells you to decide quickly.]</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, he's been all over Kim Namwoon, Han Sooyoung, Kim Dokja, and Yoo Joonghyuk before.</p>
<p>Then, does that mean I'm also a main character?</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is cancelling his 'Sponsor Application'.]</p>
<p>[The number of options for sponsors has reduced to 9.]</p>
<p>Short-tempered bastard.</p>
<p>I wasn't planning on choosing him anyway, so it wasn't a shame.</p>
<p>There were still six more to go.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>5. Nail-Eating Rat</p>
</fieldset>
<p>I suddenly regretted rejecting Black Flame Dragon.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>6. Primordial Cow</p>
<p>7. Rice Cake-Eating Tiger</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>There are still three more to go.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>8. Pig Living in a Brick House</p>
<p>9. Dog Who Threw Himself Into the Flames</p>
</fieldset>
<p>What the hell is going on here?</p>
<p>Don't tell me there's some kind of 'zodiacal pickup only' event.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, took a light, deep breath, and muttered my own lucky charm.</p>
<p>「I am Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>I checked the last constellation.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>10. ???</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Three question marks?</p>
<p>Can this be a modifier?</p>
<p>Just as I was thinking about it, a lightning bolt flashed in my head and the scene of a dark theater came to mind.</p>
<p>「"What's the identity of the constellation represented by '???' in Omniscient Reader?"」</p>
<p>Sure enough, the question had come up in &lt;Kim Dokja's Banquet&gt; before.</p>
<p>I knew the answer.</p>
<p>In the entire Omniscient Reader, there was only one constellation with the modifier '???'</p>
<p>He is the highest being who watches over everything in the universe.</p>
<p>He is the sponsor behind the regressor Yoo Joonghyuk, who only covets the next story.</p>
<p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is looking at you.]</p>
<p>The protagonist of 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』.</p>
<p>I looked up at the ceiling with trembling eyes.</p>
<p>「The Oldest Dream.」</p>
<hr/>
<p>The entity called "The Oldest Dream" in Omniscient Reader is divided into two.</p>
<p>One is the 'young Kim Dokja' who appears at the beginning of the novel.</p>
<p>The second is the 'adult Kim Dokja', who inherits the modifier in the second half of the novel.</p>
<p>Unless I'm being fooled by a high-level trick, this is clearly the beginning of the novel.</p>
<p>Above all, the presence of Bihyung and 'Daepong Girls' High School' Lee Jihye proved this fact.</p>
<p>If it was after the end of the main story of 'Omniscient Reader', there was no way Bihyung or Lee Jihye would have appeared like this.</p>
<p>「So, does '???' is the 'young Kim Dokja'?」</p>
<p>Come to think of it, it doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of 'Omniscient Reader', 'Young Kim Dokja' rarely interfered in the story, except to regress Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>He probably doesn't even realize he's a god.</p>
<p>And now he's making me a 'Sponsor Application', a man who doesn't even appear in 'Ways of Survival'?</p>
<p>Even when he's already Yoo Joonghyuk's sponsor?</p>
<p>「In that case, is '???' the 'adult Kim Dokja'?」</p>
<p>Even if I thought so, it didn't make sense either.</p>
<p>At the end of Omniscient Reader, the 'adult Kim Dokja' had his soul split into molecules and scattered into the universe.</p>
<p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is awaiting your choice.]</p>
<p>A cold tension radiating down my spine.</p>
<p>"You...... Who are you?"</p>
<p>I ask, not really expecting an answer, but.</p>
<p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is looking at you.]</p>
<p>My breathing stopped, and a chill spread through my body.</p>
<p>With a tsuchuchut, my entire body began to glow blue, followed by a terrible pain as if my spine was on fire, engulfing my consciousness.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>【■■■ ■■.】</p>
<p>【This is ■■■ playground.】</p>
<p>【You may not intervene in ■■■ story.】</p>
<p>【Even if you ■■ ■■■ ■■■■■■.】</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes again, ahjussi was shaking me.</p>
<p>"Wake up, mate!"</p>
<p>My body shook helplessly.</p>
<p>I came to my senses with a start.</p>
<p>Blood trickled from my nose.</p>
<p>What the hell? What just happened?</p>
<p>In my daze, ahjussi continued to shake me.</p>
<p>"I think I'm going to throw up......."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sorry. I just saw you with white eyes suddenly. What happened with the Sponsor Selection?"</p>
<p>"Sponsor Selection......?"</p>
<p>[There is 10 seconds left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>I quickly looked at the Sponsor Selection window.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>9. Dog Who Threw Himself Into the Flames</p>
</fieldset>
<p>I wondered what had happened.</p>
<p>Apparently, the '10th' option that was visible a moment ago has disappeared.</p>
<p>[There is 5 seconds left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]</p>
<p>I didn't have much time to think.</p>
<p>Should I choose the best constellation or.......</p>
<p>I pondered until the very last second and made my decision.</p>
<p>[Sponsor Selection has ended.]</p>
<p>Apparently, this world is not the 'Omniscient Reader' I knew.</p>
<p>I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but this world was twisted in some important way.</p>
<p>[You haven't selected a sponsor.]</p>
<p>For now, I felt the need to wait and see what would happen. I could always choose a sponsor again later.</p>
<p>As long as I somehow survived.</p>
<p>"Mate?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Did you choose?"</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi shook his head as if agreeing with my response.</p>
<p>"Oh, come to think of it, Kim Dokja......."</p>
<p>"No, no, I couldn't decide, there were a lot of good constellations."</p>
<p>It's a lie, but I had to say it like this.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' is relieved that was it.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow' is relieved.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' asks to be picked next time.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' nods saying that it can happen.]</p>
<p>By saying it like this, I avoided the criticism of the constellation that made a Sponsor Application.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' accuses you of being pathetic for missing the opportunity.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' is looking at you with narrowed eyes.]</p>
<p>Luckily, that was a good reaction.</p>
<p>"How about you?"</p>
<p>"It was pretty hard for me, too."</p>
<p>"How many constellations applied?"</p>
<p>"Four."</p>
<p>I was honestly surprised.</p>
<p>I mean, he have done some pretty unusual things, but four?</p>
<p>"Did you get any good constellations?"</p>
<p>"There were some names I recognized."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>I was a little nervous.</p>
<p>Still, he had done the good deed of saving me, so there was a chance that if he was lucky, a nice constellation would appear.</p>
<p>Luckily, the Korean Peninsula had a lot of good ones, so even he only got the 'Bald General' or 'King Heungmu', the initial scenarios would be fine.</p>
<p>"That...... 'Commander of the Red Cosmos'."</p>
<p>"Aha, Cosmos......."</p>
<p>I replied nonchalantly, then snapped my head up.</p>
<p>"'Commander of the Red Cosmos'?"</p>
<p>"Yes......."</p>
<p>I couldn't believe my eyes as I looked at the nervous-looking Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p>This was because the star he was referring to was a narrative-grade constellation. Commander of the Red Cosmos.</p>
<p>'Archangel Jophiel' of &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p>A constellation comparable to Uriel, who visited the 1,863rd round's world line with Kim Dokja and later became the ruler of &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p>With a single blow of Jophiel's stigma, lower-level demons would be destroyed without a trace.</p>
<p>"Is she a great constellation?"</p>
<p>"Yes. She's great."</p>
<p>"Actually, I don't remember much about her...... The novel has a lot of difficult words, and it's been a while since I read it......."</p>
<p>I asked, trying to calm the slightly quivering corners of my mouth.</p>
<p>"And the second one?"</p>
<p>This time he sounded confident.</p>
<p>"'Goryeo's First Sword'."</p>
<p>I let out a gasp.</p>
<p>Goryeo's First Sword, 'Cheok Jungyeong'.</p>
<p>The so-called 'Swordmaster Cheok', a powerful Korean constellation.</p>
<p>Considering its late-game potential, it wasn't a bad choice instead of a narrative class one.</p>
<p>"Wow, that's awesome. What about the third one?"</p>
<p>At that moment, Dansoo ahjussi's face looked strangely dignified.</p>
<p>The reason was soon revealed.</p>
<p>"The third one was 'God of Wine and Ecstasy'."</p>
<p>I wondered if I had misheard.</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"God of Wine and Ecstasy......."</p>
<p>"Really? You're not lying, are you?"</p>
<p>"Why would I lie?"</p>
<p>Ahjussi looked frustrated.</p>
<p>As for me, I wanted to use [Lie Detection.]</p>
<p>No, this doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Jophiel, Goryeo's First Sword.</p>
<p>And God of Wine and Ecstasy, Dionysus?</p>
<p>Who is Dionysus?</p>
<p>Isn't he one of the twelve gods of the great nebula &lt;Olympus&gt;, and a powerful narrative-grade constellation that has sided with Kim Dokja since the beginning of Omniscient Reader?</p>
<p>No, why did those constellations appear?</p>
<p>I was happy for him, but I was still a little envious and upset.</p>
<p>"Who was the last one? No way the last one......."</p>
<p>"Well, the last one constellation took me by surprise."</p>
<p>Surprise?</p>
<p>For a moment, I thought about '???'</p>
<p>Did that option come up for him too?</p>
<p>"It's a constellation called 'Sneaking Schemer'."</p>
<p>It turned out to be the Secretive Plotter imitation.</p>
<p>Luckily, that last one wasn't a big deal.</p>
<p>"He came to me, too."</p>
<p>He sounded strangely disappointed.</p>
<p>"May I ask how it was for you?"</p>
<p>"I had about ten of them."</p>
<p>"What, ten?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, I didn't get to pick anyone."</p>
<p>"May I ask which ones they were?"</p>
<p>"Well, the Black Flame Dragon and......."</p>
<p>"Black Flame Dragon!"</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi nodded, his eyes shining like a child's.</p>
<p>However, no matter how much I thought about it, there was no other constellation worth mentioning than the Black Flame Dragon.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is frowning.]</p>
<p>I thought for a moment, then decided to do the smart thing and save everyone's pride.</p>
<p>"And a dragon as famous as the Black Flame Dragon."</p>
<p>"That's incredible."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Dragon Lying Down' is moved by your words and has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p>
<p>"And...... There were a couple of constellation on the level of the Prisoner of the Golden Headband......."</p>
<p>"On the level of the Prisoner of the Golden Headband......."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow' has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames' has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p>
<p>The Prisoner of the Golden Headband is a strong monkey.</p>
<p>He doesn't know, but they're probably strong tigers, strong cows, strong rats, and strong dogs, so I was not entirely wrong.</p>
<p>Seeing them rejoice made me feel good, too.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is looking at you in disbelief.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is calling out for the 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband'.]</p>
<p>......No way.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has entered the channel.]</p>
<p>No, wait.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' has left the channel.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow' has left the channel.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' has left the channel.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames' has left the channel.]</p>
<p>I felt like I could hear Bihyung's scream from somewhere.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' asks where they all went.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' says he didn't see them because he was at home.]</p>
<p>Even as the channel fizzled, Dansoo ahjussi, who was sitting next to me, kept giving me thumbs up.</p>
<p>"Wow, that's amazing, all those big constellations."</p>
<p>"No, but who did you pick?"</p>
<p>There were three main choices.</p>
<p>Jophiel, Cheok Jungyeong and Dionysus.</p>
<p>All three are amazing constellations, so it was a matter of preference.</p>
<p>No matter who you pick, you're guaranteed a solid foundation for at least until the mid-game scenarios.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a halo seemed to emanate from Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, he was a bit old, but there was an unmistakable gleam in his eyes.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had read the whole Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>Wait, this.......</p>
<p>Is he the 'protagonist'?</p>
<p>Just as the protagonist of Omniscient Reader was Kim Dokja, maybe the protagonist of this story is this ahjussi.</p>
<p>The situation was similar to that of Kim Dokja, as there were three big names attached to him from the very beginning.</p>
<p>My heart suddenly began to race.</p>
<p>If this ahjussi is the protagonist.......</p>
<p>I thought of the first sentence about Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p>"Sometimes I thought to myself. What if I were the main character."</p>
<p>Sure enough, I nodded my head in agreement with the exquise protagonist-like remarks.</p>
<p>"If I were Kim Dokja, who would I have chosen in the first 'Sponsor Selection'?"</p>
<p>In the first &lt;Sponsor Selection&gt; Kim Dokja received a huge love letter from Uriel, the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal, Black Flame Dragon, and the Secretive Plotter, but he made the mistake of not choosing anyone.</p>
<p>"I was surprised. I would have picked the strongest one, of course."</p>
<p>"That's usually the case."</p>
<p>Kim Dokja had read the 3,149 chapters of 'Ways of Survival' that had 50,000 characters per chapter, and since he was a madman who memorized them all, he could survive with that choice.</p>
<p>However, Dansoo ahjussi had only read 551 of the 5,000 characters per chapter 'Omniscient Reader', and even then, he didn't understand most of them.</p>
<p>"Yes...... I just picked the strongest constellation, as usual."</p>
<p>"I think I know who you picked."</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes. I've forgotten a lot of other things, but I do remember the name of this constellation, because it's the strongest in the entire novel."</p>
<p>He was suddenly talking a lot, and I felt a little uneasy.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, ahjussi didn't even remember who Cheon Inho was.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi. Sorry to disappoint you, but the 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is the strong, but she's not the strongest......."</p>
<p>"I didn't pick the red flower or whatever."</p>
<p>"The 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is also a narrative-grade. As you know, above the narrative level, there's the myth level......."</p>
<p>"I don't like alcohol."</p>
<p>I said, quickly scanning my surroundings and lowering my voice.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi, I'm Korean too, so I'm very fond of 'Goryeo's First Sword', but......."</p>
<p>"I'm not such a patriot that I would call Cheok Jungyeong the strongest either."</p>
<p>"Then who the hell did you choose?"</p>
<p>Ahjussi's eyes, which felt like guns, flashed with madness.</p>
<p>"Jiyoon has always said that this constellation is the best in Omniscient Reader. That she'd end up getting married with him someday."</p>
<p>Marry?</p>
<p>"'A man who endured the tradegy of endless regressions and finally saw the end of this world', Jiyoon had that on a poster in her room."</p>
<p>I suddenly realized what had happened.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>There's no way a reader of my novel would get that confused.</p>
<p>But Dansoo ahjussi was smiling confidently, like Kim Dokja who had already broken through the [Last Wall.]</p>
<p>"I've picked the strongest one, the 'Sneaking Schemer'."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' is smiling brightly.]</p>
<p>I suddenly began to think that he was like Han Myungoh, who chose 'Lame Trickster'.</p>
<p>[The restriction on this area has been lifted!]</p>
<p>In the distance, I could see men with pipes running toward us.</p>
<p>[The next scenario is about to begin.]</p>
<p>Maybe we'll die before we meet Kim Dokja.</p>
