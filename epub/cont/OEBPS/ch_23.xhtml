<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">575 Episode 4. An Unwalked Road (3)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>We stood side by side, holding on to one of the thorns.</p>
<p>"You can't pass out!"</p>
<p>"Don't worry!"</p>
<p>I said, but I wasn't sure if my physical strength would hold up.</p>
<p>Normally, I would have used my 'Elaine Forest Essence' to heal my wounds and get moving, but I was in a hurry now that I'd lost [Purest Sword Force].</p>
<p>The sooner I could get out of here and get the other hidden pieces, the safer I would be.</p>
<p>Especially if this world is the one I think.</p>
<p>What happened to Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi? I need to tell them about the 'Yoo Joonghyuk' I saw as soon as possible.</p>
<p>My eyelids kept dropping.</p>
<p>I don't know how many times I blacked out and woke up again.</p>
<p>"Wake up!"</p>
<p>Jung Heewon pinched my waist with her left arm.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p>"Ah."</p>
<p>The ichthyosaur's movements had slowed down. The crimson-colored stomach walls had turned almost grayish white.</p>
<p>"I think it's done. Just a little more to go......."</p>
<p>It was then that something unexpected happened.</p>
<p>I heard a sound like a wind leak from somewhere, and a large, sharp set of teeth appeared, slicing through the guts from the outside.</p>
<p>I instinctively screamed.</p>
<p>"Hold your breath!"</p>
<p>The black river rushed in through the cracks.</p>
<p>We clung to each other's arms and were swept away into the Han River.</p>
<p>[An error has occurred in the hidden scenario.]</p>
<p>[The hidden scenario was partially completed.]</p>
<p>Something attacked the ichthyosaur, targeting the 'stomach'.</p>
<p>The gut of the torn ichthyosaur scattered in the dark river. Through the swirling blood, two hideous eyes glared at me.</p>
<p>A monster twice as large as the one that had devoured us.</p>
<p>I recognized it immediately.</p>
<p>The ichthyosaur that swallowed Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>Sea-commander.</p>
<p>My heart sank as I saw the sea commander charging to devour us and Jung Heewon's horrified expression.</p>
<p>「Jung Heewon is going to die.」</p>
<p>From the first scenario to being eaten by the ichthyosaur, what I did ran through my head like a movie.</p>
<p>How I had changed the story with the arrogance of writing the original.</p>
<p>I shouldn't have rehabilitated the Cheoldoo Group.</p>
<p>I shouldn't have gone out looking for Kim Dokja or Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>「Are you really Cheon Inho?」</p>
<p>It would have been better if I had been killed by Jung Heewon while pretending to be a villain like in the original novel. Then she would have awakened safely as the 'Judge of Destruction'.</p>
<p>She would have survived.</p>
<p>I began to untie the knot on my right arm with my teeth.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon looked back at me in horror.</p>
<p>When I finished, I felt rather at peace.</p>
<p>「This is a fitting end for the villain Cheon Inho.」</p>
<p>My body slowly sank beneath the water, along with the loose knot.</p>
<p>Bubbles of air flowed out of Jung Heewon's mouth as she shouted something at me.</p>
<p>I saw the sea commander opening his mouth at me and Jung Heewon reaching for me.</p>
<p>In my fading consciousness, I heard the tick, tick, tick of time stopping.</p>
<p>[A new day has begun.]</p>
<p>[Your creativity has been recharged.]</p>
<p>I realized what was about to happen.</p>
<p>[The character 'Jung Heewon' wants to do something unexpected.]</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill '■■' is activated!]</p>
<p>[You have entered the 'Snowfield'.]</p>
<p>Looking at the blank space in front of me, a bitter laugh escaped from his dwindling</p>
<p>consciousness.</p>
<p>Damn it. I'm supposed to write until I die.</p>
<fieldset>
<p># Jung Heewon's Awakening</p>
<br/>
<p>■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■</p>
<p>* At your current skill level, you can write a total of 180 additional characters.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>[You can stay in the 'Snowfield' for a total of 4 minutes.]</p>
<p>I looked at the first sentence of the blank line.</p>
<p>「Jung Heewon.」</p>
<p>I wonder if it's okay if I keep writing.</p>
<p>[There are 3 minutes remaining.]</p>
<p>For some reason, I was not confident. Something was different from Kim Cheolyang and Bang Cheolsoo.</p>
<p>I remembered how I felt as a child when I received my first manuscript.</p>
<p>As I looked at the vague blank page, I naturally remembered the snowy landscape I saw with Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>In my dream, Kim Dokja said.</p>
<p>「It's dazzling.」</p>
<p>He said.</p>
<p>「Anything can become a reality in this place.」</p>
<p>It snowed heavily from the sky, and we lay side by side in the snow and looked back at the footprints we walked together. Before I knew it, the footprints were hard to see.</p>
<p>「Because no one remembers what they were.」</p>
<p>I don't remember if he said that.</p>
<p>But the spot where I laid with Kim Dokja was strangely comfortable and warm. If I could, I wanted to stay there forever, curled up in a tight ball and writing nothing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I couldn't.</p>
<p>Because I am a writer.</p>
<p>「Jung Heewon remembered that day」</p>
<p>If I don't write, I can't live.</p>
<p>「for the first time in a long time.」</p>
<p>So I wrote the sentence.</p>
<p>I chose words like I would choose clothes for Jung Heewon, and I chose endings like I would choose shoes for her.</p>
<p>I imagined her wearing those shoes, walking down a road that no one remembers.</p>
<p>[This story might be possible.]</p>
<p>[This story's reproduction success rate is 50%.]</p>
<p>[Current Accumulated Probability: 10]</p>
<p>[You can increase the reproduction success rate by investing more probability.]</p>
<p>'I'll do it.'</p>
<p>[You have spent 10 probability points.]</p>
<p>[You can write an additional 160 characters.]</p>
<p>I continued to write sentence after sentence.</p>
<p>Would these lies I wrote save her life.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>But I had to try everything I could.</p>
<p>[This story is plausible.]</p>
<p>[This story's reproduction success rate is 88%.]</p>
<p>[Do you want to check the reader's feedback?]</p>
<p>'Yes.'</p>
<p>There were three comments this time.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>rlaehrwk37: Cheer up</p>
<p>rlaehrwk61: Cheer up</p>
<p>rlaehrwk99: Cheer up</p>
</fieldset>
<p>I thought, my mouth open in disbelief.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[Successfully recreating the scene.]</p>
<p>[Leaving the 'Snowfield'.]</p>
<p>Time began to pass again. My breathing unraveled, and weak bubbles escaped my mouth.</p>
<p>I didn't write about whether I would survive; there was no room for that.</p>
<p>But I did write at least one thing for sure.</p>
<p>「Jung Heewon remembered that day for the first time in a long time.」</p>
<p>That you, who live this story, will surely survive.</p>
<p>「'Heewon, you're too aggressive. This is a sport. You can't really hurt your opponent.'」</p>
<p>「'This month alone, three people have quit because of you. There's a kid with a broken arm. If you continue like this, I won't be able to keep protecting you.'」</p>
<p>A pure white light emanated from Jung Heewon's body.</p>
<p>「Jung Heewon couldn't quite understand the couch's words. Wasn't the sword made to kill opponents?」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja once said. He said that he likes the moment a character's attribute blossoms the most.</p>
<p>「Isn't it more strange if you don't get hurt while fighting with a sword?」</p>
<p>Now I agree with Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>[The attribute of the character 'Jung Heewon' is blossoming.]</p>
<p>I couldn't put it any other way.</p>
<p>The figure of Jung Heewon, who is now cutting through the tide and approaching, is truly dazzling.</p>
<p>Her hot hands grabbed my hands strongly. I felt my body being firmly anchored.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon looked back at the sea commander as she clutched the ground rat knife.</p>
<p>Riding the rapids, she swooped toward the sea commander as if she had wings.</p>
<p>[The character 'Jung Heewon' has used 'Kendo Lv.3'!]</p>
<p>[The character 'Jung Heewon' has used 'Demon Slaying Lv.2'!]</p>
<p>No matter how strong Jung Heewon is, she can't defeat a sea commander with just [Kendo] and [Demon Slaying].</p>
<p>But I wrote that it is possible. So it should be possible.</p>
<p>It will be possible.</p>
<p>「Jung Heewon wanted to ask the couch.」</p>
<p>It is possible.</p>
<p>「'Is it okay to kill this thing?'」</p>
<p>In my fading consciousness, the words were slurred.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the distance, I could hear Jung Heewon's shout.</p>
<p>「The dormant senses in her soul were awakening.」</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the ground rat sword broke through the spray and plunged into the sea commander's left eye. The bleeding sea commander howled wildly.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon didn't stop and pulled the thorn from my waistband. The sea commander's tail cut through the water and grazed her waist.</p>
<p>The enormous impact jolted the view.</p>
<p>She squinted her bloodshot eyes, clutched me tightly with one arm, and drove the thorn into the ichthyosaur's tail.</p>
<p>「'This is not a sport.'」</p>
<p>That was a sentence I didn't write.</p>
<p>「'If I don't kill this monster, someone else will die.'」</p>
<p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier agrees with incarnation 'Jung Heewon's will.]</p>
<p>And a message came from somewhere.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating-Rat' agrees with incarnation 'Jung Heewon's will.]</p>
<p>The light emanating from her body grew stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' agrees with incarnation 'Jung Heewon's will.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' agrees with incarnation 'Jung Heewon's will.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' agrees with incarnation 'Jung Heewon's will.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow' agrees with incarnation 'Jung Heewon's will.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' agrees with incarnation 'Jung Heewon's will.]</p>
<p>.......</p>
<p>I felt an invisible Libra tilting.</p>
<p>[All constellations in the channel agree to the use of the skill.]</p>
<p>['Hour of Judgment' has been activated.]</p>
<p>Hour of Judgment.</p>
<p>A skill that grants invincibility when activated against the wicked.</p>
<p>However, the enemy in front of us was a monster.</p>
<p>[The attribute of the character 'Jung Heewon' has blossomed to 'Demon Slaying Judge (Hero)'.]</p>
<p>With a dazzling flash of light, a blood-colored aura enveloped Jung Heewon's body.</p>
<p>Demon Slaying (滅魔) Judge.</p>
<p>Surely, there was such an attribute. It was one of the three great judges' attributes, but it hadn't appeared in the main story.</p>
<p>It wasn't a class that specialized in hand-to-hand combat like the Judge of Destruction, but it was an indestructible hero class that increased its combat power many times against monsters.</p>
<p>[You have contributed greatly to the blossoming of the attribute 'Crouching Figure'!]</p>
<p>[The character 'Jung Heewon' won't hesitate to be your sword in the future.]</p>
<p>With an eerie trajectory, the thorn moved forward and stabbed the sea commander's body.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon stabbed and stabbed and stabbed at the sea commander like a madman. From the tail, to the body, to the neck, to the crown.</p>
<p>When she finally stabbed the second eye, it jerked as if it had been electrocuted, and then went limp.</p>
<p>Its lifeless body floated to the surface of the Han River.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, with me on her back, soared into the sky on the back of the sea commander.</p>
<p>Along with the rushing river, I could see the ruined city of Seoul.</p>
<p>Smoke rising from everywhere. Collapsed buildings, and the indifferent moon hanging over the ruins of civilization.</p>
<p>The destruction I wrote became the landscape.</p>
<p>「'Dazzling.'」</p>
<p>Looking at the landscape of the end of the world as we knew it, Jung Heewon was thinking the same thing I was.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was the landscape that Kim Dokja and Jung Heewon shared.</p>
<p>['Hour of Judgment' has ended.]</p>
<p>And now I was looking at that astounding world with her.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, who had landed on the ground with me on her back, fell forward.</p>
<p>In the distance, I could see a poisonous mist rolling in.</p>
<p>I tied another knot in her arm, then dragged her to the basement of a nearby building to hide.</p>
<p>[You have bought 2 'Elaine Monkey's Lungs'.]</p>
<p>I popped a lung into Jung Heewon's mouth, and I popped a lung into mine.</p>
<p>Starlight streamed in from the basement window. It was a little cold, and strangely, my heart didn't stop pounding.</p>
<p>The night of destruction was long.</p>
<p>I looked at Jung Heewon as she slept and thought long and hard about the lies I had written and would write in the future.</p>
<hr/>
<p>On the Han River, in the solitary moonlight.</p>
<p>The dead sea commander's stomach lurched several times, and then a figure crawled out of the faded scales.</p>
<p>"Ha, I almost died. Really."</p>
<p>She brushed the blood off her coat and looked around, sighing softly.</p>
<p>"That's the first time I've ever had a scenario stolen from me, by the way. What an asshole."</p>
<p>But there was no one to hear her.</p>
<p>Well, there was one.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' chuckles and says this place is a bit unusual.]</p>
<p>"What are you laughing at, dude. Why do you have that modifier?"</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' asks what's wrong with his modifier.]</p>
<p>"What about the others?"</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' says not yet.]</p>
<p>She pursed her lips lightly, as if in disbelief, and sighed deeply again.</p>
<p>After a moment, she looked up, an odd smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>"Well, it's my first scenario in a long time."</p>
<p>Her eyes sparkled intensely for a moment as she stared off into space, searching for a star somewhere in the night sky.</p>
<p>"I'm going to live for myself first."</p>
