<hr/>
<p>The story, 「Demon King of Salvation」.</p>
<p>Since it was the core story that put Kim Dokja as a Constellation, it was very difficult to recreate.</p>
<p>[The conditions for 'Staging' are partially met.]</p>
<p>Before we knew it, the 'High-level Demons' had been sorted out, and Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, and Shin Yoosoung had gathered around us.</p>
<p>Just then, Ji Eunyu appeared through the bushes. Jung Heewon was carried on her back.</p>
<p>With this, most of the members of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;, including Lee Gilyoung, who had fallen, had gathered.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, who represented them, glared at the Demon King of Salvation from afar and muttered.</p>
<p>"Is that guy a 'Great Demon'?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What kind of evil scheme are you plotting again?"</p>
<p>"An evil scheme? This is a clear operation."</p>
<p>Since this was the 'Recycling Center' and the scenario was 'hunting the Demon King of Salvation', the probability itself needed for 'staging' was sufficient.</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation kept nodding his head as if he had figured out all of my plans.</p>
<p>"This will be fun."</p>
<p>I bit my lips without realizing it.</p>
<p>Can you even say that at this moment?</p>
<p>For him who looked as excited as a child, I must now write the last sentence he wants.</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation said, spreading his arms wide as if he would take on the role of the villain.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's begin."</p>
<p>The stage opened with a rippling background.</p>
<p>Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung, Shin Yoosoung, and Kim Namwoon surrounded the Demon King of Salvation on all sides, and then Killer King, Cha Yerin, Lee Dansu, and Kyung Sein joined in.</p>
<p>"Hit!"</p>
<p>With Lee Jihye's shout, a sharp light swept over the Demon King of Salvation's entire body. Between the dust that rose up in a thick haze, Lee Hyunsung and Kyung Sein continued to butt-fight.</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation raised both hands and caught the two.</p>
<p>"The group was running."</p>
<p>While the Demon King of Salvation’s hands were tied, Cha Yerin, who activated [Main Battle Action Fighting], and Kim Namwoon, who activated [Knife Fighting], aimed behind the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p>「In the &lt;Star Stream&gt;, existence is 'stories'.」</p>
<p>[Baekcheong-ganggi and Heukhwa combined attack.]</p>
<p>The Black and White Energy stabbed the Demon King of Salvation in the back.</p>
<p>「In the gaze of countless Constellations pouring down from the sky, the story that would kill him was approaching one sentence at a time.」</p>
<p>It felt strange. This was the story that had once killed him.</p>
<p>I remembered the &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; of that time. None of them really wanted to kill Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>How is it now?</p>
<p>"Yup! It’s empty!"</p>
<p>Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung, and Kim Namwoon were swinging their weapons at Kim Dokja without any hesitation.</p>
<p>The only ones who showed lukewarm movements were Shin Yoosoung and readers like me. Kyung Sein and Lee Dansu looked back at me several times and asked with their eyes.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?"</p>
<p>They knew who the Demon King of Salvation was and why he was there.</p>
<p>They knew what he had sacrificed to protect this universe. Nevertheless, I nodded at them.</p>
<p>That was the only way I could change this story.</p>
<p>"Master!"</p>
<p>The last attack was from Yoo Joonghyuk. The Wolgeuk in his hand surged forward, scattering pitch-black energy. The golden energy in the changgeuk hit the Demon King of Salvation’s stomach.</p>
<p>Kim Namwoon grumbled.</p>
<p>"Did you hurt him?"</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation’s incarnation was revealed through the smoky dust. Despite the combined attack of the group, the Demon King of Salvation was barely injured. Kim Namwoon muttered in shock.</p>
<p>"What kind of a bullshit—"</p>
<p>"Master, is that really something you can beat?"</p>
<p>[The '73rd Demon King' enters a new phase!]</p>
<p>At the same time as Lee Jihye grumbled, a message was heard from the air.</p>
<p>[The Great Demon King, the 'Demon King of Salvation' rises in rank!]</p>
<p>"Crazy. They're saying he's getting stronger there?"</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation's body fired magical blades in rapid succession. He was leisurely taking on the entire group while building a barrier with [Way of the Wind].</p>
<p>"Youngest, this story doesn't make me 'weak'. You haven't forgotten, have you?"</p>
<p>I remembered it too.</p>
<p>During the 73rd Demon King scenario, he survived attacks from the entire &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;.</p>
<p>An entity that neither Han Sooyoung's [Avatar], Jung Heewon's [Hellfire], nor Shin Yoosoung's Chimera Dragon could eat. He was the scenario boss, the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk!"</p>
<p>However, regardless of whether the opponent was a Demon King or a Constellation, the influence of「Staging」was absolute.</p>
<p>"Take it!"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk caught the 'Cheonjongun Sword' that I had thrown. He seemed to have figured out why I had thrown the sword at that moment.</p>
<p>"Is it a guy with the resurrection trait?"</p>
<p>Then the Demon King of Salvation answered on my behalf.</p>
<p>"That's right. I will be resurrected even if I die."</p>
<p>"This sword can erase the resurrection trait."</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation nodded as if he agreed and then playfully grinned.</p>
<p>"But I don't know if you can do it."</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Yoo Joonghyuk swung the Cheonjongun Sword.</p>
<p>「The power gained through the story is ultimately destroyed by the story. His resurrection trait, 'Eight Lives', comes from the power of the Constellation Yamata no Orochi.」</p>
<p>The trajectory of [Breaking The Sky Swordsmanship] was recorded on the blade of the Cheonheungun Sword. The moment the final touch, which even erased the resurrection trait, reached the chest of the Demon King of Salvation, his lips trembled slightly.</p>
<p>[The realization of 'Staging' shakes.]</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's surprised sword seemed to shake, and then the Demon King of Salvation waved his hands and struck the sword away.</p>
<p>It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>The power of 「Staging」 was absolute. No matter how strong the Demon King of Salvation was, there was no way he could take the Cheonjongun Sword.</p>
<p>I staggered toward the battlefield. Yoo Joonghyuk stepped back and stopped me.</p>
<p>"Don't come. You'll die if you keep that state."</p>
<p>"What did he just say?"</p>
<p>I saw it clearly.</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation said something to Yoo Joonghyuk, and from then on, Yoo Joonghyuk's condition changed. Yoo Joonghyuk thought for a moment and then confessed in a small growl.</p>
<p>"He said I wouldn't be able to use this sword properly."</p>
<p>He can't use that sword?</p>
<p>I wondered what that meant, but a message immediately came to mind.</p>
<p>[The current target is suffering from the side effects of 'Binding of Truth'.]</p>
<p>Binding of Truth.</p>
<p>One of Yoo Joonghyuk's 'Story Engravings', where some of his memories are sealed in exchange for gaining great power.</p>
<p>I suddenly raised my head and asked.</p>
<p>"Have you forgotten how to use the sword?"</p>
<p>"I can't use it like before."</p>
<p>Is that so?</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's main weapon in the 41st Round was the 'spear'. So he must have sacrificed 'how to use the sword' as a sacrifice for the Story Engraving.</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation looked at me from afar and grumbled.</p>
<p>"Do you understand now?"</p>
<p>I answered calmly.</p>
<p>"I expected it."</p>
<p>"Really? Then you know the solution."</p>
<p>Is it because I was tired? My consciousness kept fading. For a brief moment, my consciousness flickered and flickered.</p>
<p>Right now, it seemed like 'that' would be possible.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk. Think about me from now on."</p>
<p>"What nonsense are you talking about—"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me with a serious expression. Then, the skill was activated.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' is activated!]</p>
<p>The moment my incarnation body fell, my soul was inhabited by Yoo Joonghyuk's incarnation through [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint].</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, surprised, said.</p>
<p>"You, how—"</p>
<p>'There's no time to explain in detail now! Give me the sword!'</p>
<p>The phase of the Demon King of Salvation passed once again.</p>
<p>Now, the party was being pushed back in a hurry instead of pushing forward. Every time the Demon King of Salvation made a light gesture, a huge shock wave occurred, pressuring the party.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk shook his head and said.</p>
<p>"In my current state, I can't use this sword properly. It would be better to hold a spear—"</p>
<p>'No, this time, take the sword. And that too!'</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk picked up the two blades that had fallen next to my incarnation body—'Ray Bringer's' 'Light Wish'.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader Viewpoint' activates to the limit!]</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World' activates!]</p>
<p>Then, the text of 'Ways of Survival' began to appear.</p>
<p>「In the darkness, Yoo Joonghyuk held the sword.」</p>
<p>In accordance with the flow of the text, Yoo Joonghyuk also held the sword again.</p>
<p>「In the time fault of the dark dimension, Yoo Joonghyuk swung the sword again and again.」</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, who had undergone extreme training to become a transcendent. The record of Yoo Joonghyuk was being passed on to Yoo Joonghyuk through me once again. As if he had noticed what was happening, the corners of the mouth of the Demon King of Salvation's mouth widened into a smile.</p>
<p>"That's amazing."</p>
<p>This was a strategy that Kim Dokja had once used. 'Reviving the forgotten tale of Yoo Joonghyuk through the 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p>"You've grown up a lot, Youngest."</p>
<p>The swords clashed.</p>
<p>A cracking sound that tore through the sky.</p>
<p>The two swords repeatedly aimed for each other's neck, chest, and shoulder. The thighs were torn and the shoulders were split. Blood spurted onto the ground.</p>
<p>Even so, the swords did not stop.</p>
<p>This was not enough.</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation probably also knew that I would use the 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p>I couldn't defeat him with the 'story' he already knew.</p>
<p>That's why,</p>
<p>「A story that the Demon King of Salvation doesn't know.」</p>
<p>I had to rewrite this story, a story that I had once left unfinished.</p>
<p>Calmly drawing an old scene in my head. It was the story of the prison guard who ruled over infinite time.</p>
<p>「Ma Hyunsung looked at the Demon King of Salvation.」</p>
<p>I could see a look of surprise and bewilderment on the Demon King of Salvation's face.</p>
<p>「Upon closer inspection, it seemed like him and the Demon King of Salvation somehow resembled each other. No, maybe he resembled the Demon. After a long fight, they had finally become a part of each other.」</p>
<p>'Yoo Joonghyuk!'</p>
<p>「I know that the story won’t end here with the defeat of the Demon. I also know that I will be lonely after the end of a long fight. When even the one great enemy who understands him—the Demon—disappears, his world will be filled with emptiness.」</p>
<p>'Ray Bringer' and 'Light Wish' emitted bright light and soon transformed into a single sword.</p>
<p>Sacred sword.</p>
<p>Light Bringer.</p>
<p>The decisive weapon of the protagonist of 'Infinite Instructor', Ma Hyunsung, and the only weapon that can effectively strike the Demon.</p>
<p>「Even so, he decided to walk toward that emptiness.」</p>
<p>The sacred sword Light Bringer emitted light along with a bright ray of light.</p>
<p>「He decided to cut down his only understanding and confirm the end of this forest where nothing exists.」</p>
<p>One of the Demon King’s arms gave birth to empty space. His fluttering coat was torn and the sound of his bones breaking was heard. The Demon King was in a hurry and 'thoughts' seemed to be changing to 'Unbreakable Faith'.</p>
<p>However, it was a mistake.</p>
<p>[The reproducibility of the stage is increased!]</p>
<p>If the 'Ground Rat Sword' increased the reproducibility of the Geumho Station stage, 'Unbreakable Faith' contributed to the reproducibility of the stage of 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p>"Ah."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's right hand moved as if by magic. A single sword traversed the light beam revealed by Light Bringer. A devastating blow that shattered the sky where Constellations hung was placed at the tip of Cheonheungun Sword.</p>
<p>With the sound of the stomach skin being pierced, the expanding magic wave swept through the center of the battlefield like a storm.</p>
<p>[The Constellations of the Nebula &lt;Olympus&gt; are calling out to you!]</p>
<p>[The Constellations of the Nebula &lt;Vedas&gt; are suspicious of your activities!]</p>
<p>[Some Constellations of the Nebula &lt;Asgard&gt; are attempting to invade the Recycling Center!]</p>
<p>[All Constellations of the 'Recycling Center' are staring at the battlefield!]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[You have achieved a non-existent achievement!]</p>
<p>[All the Dokkaebi of the Management Bureau are astonished at your story!]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' is released!]</p>
<p>I woke up with a spurt of blood. I gasped for breath several times in my messy incarnation body and got up from my seat.</p>
<p>I started to walk unsteadily.</p>
<p>"Please."</p>
<p>That's when someone grabbed my hand.</p>
<p>"Don't kill him."</p>
<p>With the voices dispersing, the hand that had been holding me disappeared. I could not feel any signs.</p>
<p>I wondered if it might have been Lee Gilyoung.</p>
<p>I looked at the spot where Lee Gilyoung had disappeared for a moment, then staggered forward again.</p>
<p>The group had collapsed where the pitch-black dust had settled. Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung, Kim Namwoon, Shin Yoosoung...</p>
<p>And someone was sitting on their knees in the center of the dust storm.</p>
<p>I called his name.</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>He didn't answer. I called him again.</p>
<p>"Demon King of Salvation."</p>
<p>Then he raised his head. My older brother was there, smiling with blood dripping from his mouth and his stomach pierced by the Cheonchongun sword.</p>
<p>[The Great Demon King, the 'Demon King of Salvation' meets his fate.]</p>
<p>The old prophecy of the stellar nebula was once again coming true.</p>
<p>「The Constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' will die in the story he loved.」</p>
<p>He smiled as he faced that fate.</p>
<p>Is this really the story you wanted? Can you even say that you love this kind of story?</p>
<p>[Your sponsor completely transfers his status to you.]</p>
<p>A Constellation that hung in the infinitely high sky. A Constellation that protected me in that sky over and over again. Now, that Constellation was within arm's reach.</p>
<p>I slowly knelt before him.</p>
<p>"What a pity."</p>
<p>Like someone who had finally graduated from this story, the Demon King of Salvation was smiling dazzlingly.</p>
<p>"I want to read it one more time."</p>
