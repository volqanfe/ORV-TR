<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">705 Episode 26 Star Ladder (1)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>With Yoo Joonghyuk's roar, the atmosphere of the battlefield changed. The frightened incarnations began to leave the battlefield one by one.</p>
<p>[Someone uses the 'Star Ladder'!]</p>
<p>[Someone uses the 'Star Ladder'!]</p>
<p>This scenario was a 'sub-scenario' and did not necessarily need to be cleared.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute, you guys—"</p>
<p>Because they didn't come here to protect Washington in the first place.</p>
<p>"I’m sorry, Prophet."</p>
<p>As the allies she trusted disappeared one by one, Anna Croft's expression became anxious.</p>
<p>The 'Star Ladder' in the sky continued to emit bright light.</p>
<p>"Anna."</p>
<p>Selena Kim and Christina stood by her side. Her colleagues also knew that there was no chance of victory at this rate.</p>
<p>Anna and Zarathustra's elites have already completed the subjugation of the 4 Grade Disaster Species. They could also use that Star Ladder if they wanted to.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Anna did not leave the scenario.</p>
<p>If she abandons Washington, America will collapse. The invasion of the Demon World will continue and eventually hit Las Vegas.</p>
<p>As the representative of 'Zarathustra', she had a duty to protect this continent.</p>
<p>"Cheon Inho."</p>
<p>Anna Croft looked at me.</p>
<p>She was so desperate that she had to resort to her least favorite scammer.</p>
<p>"I will stop it. Instead—"</p>
<p>So, now was the only time for the scammer to set a 'condition'.</p>
<p>"Please lend me some of your skills."</p>
<p>"Which..."</p>
<p>"I know you have the 'Elixir Maker' trait."</p>
<p>The real reason I came to see Anna Croft.</p>
<p>I took out the ´Lesser Dragon Heart' from her arms. A reward obtained from defeating a 4th Grade Earth Dragon.</p>
<p>However, because the processing process for Dragon Heart is so complicated, there is currently only one way to refine it into an elixir.</p>
<p>"I need your blood."</p>
<p>It is to mix it with the blood of the 'Elixir Manufacturer'.</p>
<p>A startled Anna Croft stared at me closely and said.</p>
<p>"You know what happens if you drink my blood."</p>
<p>"I will become a member of your household."</p>
<p>I said this, recalling Kim Dokja from the Third Round, who was revived after drinking Anna's blood.</p>
<p>"But that’s when I’m of a lower rank than you."</p>
<p>"Are you saying your level is higher than mine now?"</p>
<p>Certainly, when I looked at me now, I was insignificant.</p>
<p>I do not have a solid embodiment like Yoo Joonghyuk, nor do I have powerful mental skills like Nirvana.</p>
<p>I do not lead a powerful group like Anna, nor do she have a sponsor that everyone knows about.</p>
<p>But there is one thing I am confident about.</p>
<p>[Story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is hungry.]</p>
<p>'Stories.'</p>
<p>"How can you—"</p>
<p>Anna's eyes widened as she sensed the story flowing from my body.</p>
<p>It has to be that way.</p>
<p>Because I have already collected three stories. And exactly in those three stories, there was a clear difference in class between me and the other incarnations.</p>
<p>"We don’t have time. What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>Anna Croft still seemed hesitant.</p>
<p>The fact that her 'blood' is an elixir is still a top secret. The moment this fact is revealed, incarnations from all over the world will target her.</p>
<p>So for her to display this ability in front of me now was already a gamble.</p>
<p>Anna, who was worried, eventually received the Dragon Heart.</p>
<p>"It will take about 5 minutes. You are confident, right?"</p>
<p>I stepped in front of her with my back to Anna.</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, trampling on  Nirvana, was crying towards the sky.</p>
<p>[The attribute 'Cyclic Delay' is activated.]</p>
<p>I slowly took a breath and circulated the magical energy throughout my body.</p>
<p>—Youngest.</p>
<p>'Yes. Is it possible now?'</p>
<p>[Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint’s cooldown has already ended.]</p>
<p>[Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint 'Stage 3' is in effect!]</p>
<p>The problem was probability.</p>
<p>Even if Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint was at level 3, it was not completely free from the influence of probability.</p>
<p>—Is it possible?</p>
<p>But it's different now.</p>
<p>I knew it instinctively.</p>
<p>Like when Yamata no Orochi descended on [Peace Land], the 'probability aftermaths' do not blow in their normal form in this scenario.</p>
<p>In other words, this scenario works by putting each other's status on the 'scale' and canceling out each other's probabilities.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>「This time, we may be able to use the true power of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.」</p>
<p>I activated [Incite] at the right time.</p>
<p>「I am Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>['Incite' goes hand in hand with 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'!]</p>
<p>[The synchronization rate with the sponsor is increasing!]</p>
<p>It feels like a layer of film is being placed on my soul, like wearing hard yet soft clothes.</p>
<p>As I slowly blinked, the scenery of the world changed. The high sky became even lower, and the gaze of the Constellations felt more blatant.</p>
<p>[Some Constellations are surprised by your status! ]</p>
<p>[The Constellations of the National Tree pay homage to your status .]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is surprised as to whether you actually have hidden powers.]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking closely at your story.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' looks at you with his eyes wide open.]</p>
<p>Christina, who was standing a few steps away, stumbled.</p>
<p>As for her, if she really is an 'apostle', she will have no choice but to recognize who is possessing me now.</p>
<p>"As expected of you…"</p>
<p>Finally, Yoo Joonghyuk looked this way. The moment our eyes met, I knew the bastard would move.</p>
<p>"Come, Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p>At the same time as control of the body was transferred to Kim Dokja, 'Unbreakable Faith' flashed in the air.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's flying front foot and the brilliantly rising 'Blade of Faith' collided with each other.</p>
<p>Coo coo coo coo!</p>
<p>The blade and forepaw collided and a loud noise erupted.</p>
<p>I was taking the attack from that monstrous beast.</p>
<p>—Woah! Are you that surprised? Even if I look like this, I am 'fable grade'.</p>
<p>I realize it again.</p>
<p>That playful 'neighborhood brother' is actually a shining 'Constellation' in the sky.</p>
<p>—I cannot properly use even 10% of my power in this incarnation.</p>
<p>To be exact, even that '10%' was difficult.</p>
<p>The muscles of my entire body were screaming, and I could feel my magic power quickly depleting in real time.</p>
<p>—The decision will be made within 5 minutes.</p>
<p>The tale began to tell its story on Kim Dokja’s behalf.</p>
<p>[The story 'King of a Kingless World' begins its storytelling !]</p>
<p>The first story obtained by Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p>「No king under the heavens of this world can call himself true.」</p>
<p>The 'King of a Kingless World' was declaring to the 'Supreme King'.</p>
<p>「Only the king who denies the king will exist.」</p>
<p>The power of the story exploded and I kicked the ground and ran. I felt confident that I could cut down anything that got in my way.</p>
<p>'Blade of Faith’ expanded explosively.</p>
<p>For the first time, a hint of confusion appeared in the eyes of that scary beast.</p>
<p>Sugagak.</p>
<p>The cut off black fur fluttered in the air and blood splattered. Yoo Joonghyuk's stance, which was focused on attack, was changing.</p>
<p>A cautious defensive stance centered on [Strong Self-Defense].</p>
<p>In that brief moment, the beast made a decision. This 'story' cannot be used for very long.</p>
<p>'Is it smart?'</p>
<p>Even Yoo Joonghyuk was instinctively suppressing the story of the 'Supreme King'.</p>
<p>As if he knew that the moment he used that story, 'King of Kingless World' would be used.</p>
<p>All he uses are 'beast' techniques that rely solely on instinct.</p>
<p>—I don’t know if Yoo Joonghyuk is smart or if the demon possessing him is smart.</p>
<p>The story of 'King of a Kingless World' was spreading in real time.</p>
<p>As he expected, my incarnation body could not maintain the power of a legendary story for long.</p>
<p>'What should I do now?'</p>
<p>—We have to use other means.</p>
<p>Other means?</p>
<p>The moment I was about to ask what else there was, a message rang in my head.</p>
<p>A sigh flowed from within.</p>
<p>This is the technology that made 'Kim Dokja' into a 'reader'.</p>
<p>He defeated numerous enemies with this technique and absorbed their power as his own.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]</p>
<p>In my head, I ran through a list of countless characters that Kim Dokja had read about so far.</p>
<p>Some characters I knew, some I didn't even know.</p>
<p>Some characters were too weak to be appropriate for use at the moment, while others were so strong that it was impossible to know if probability would allow it.</p>
<p>—There are people to choose from.</p>
<p>However, there was no hesitation in Kim Dokja's choice.</p>
<p>[Bookmark number 11 has been activated!]</p>
<p>—If this guy is the '41st Round', there is someone who must be chosen.</p>
<p>I felt like the magical energy in my whole body was shaking violently and I got goosebumps.</p>
<p>I realized who I had become.</p>
<p>「The pure white coat was covered with white fur.」</p>
<p>I never thought I would see this scenery with my own eyes.</p>
<p>[Bookmark number 11 'Disaster of Floods Shin Yoosoung' is activated!]</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Beast King’s Sensitivity Lv.???'  is activated!]</p>
<p>White fur fluttering like white snow.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's pupils wavered as he looked this way. Even someone with only instincts would have noticed.</p>
<p>No matter how strong the beast-turned-guy is, he can't defeat me now.</p>
<p>「"I am the 'Beast Lord'."」</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, the Disaster of Floods.</p>
<p>「"King of all 'monsters'."」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja rushed over in an instant and hit Yoo Joonghyuk on the head with the side of the blade.</p>
<p>One shot, two shots, three shots.</p>
<p>Even though it seemed like an attack that could be easily avoided, Yoo Joonghyuk could not avoid it. Like a subject who cannot disobey the king's orders.</p>
<p>Every time Yoo Joonghyuk's head was hit, 41st Shin Yoosoung's story was told.</p>
<p>「"What on earth were we to the Captain?"」</p>
<p>「"I hate you for living alone in this world."」</p>
<p>「"I will end your world in the most horrific way."」</p>
<p>No matter what anyone says, they cannot say that this pain is a lie.</p>
<p>41st round Shin Yoosoung's very existence was the crime of 41st Round Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>As if receiving punishment for his crime, Kim Dokja delivered a powerful kick to Yoo Joonghyuk's stomach.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk flew about ten meters and fell, breaking the window of the National Assembly building.</p>
<p>「"Ahjussi… Can I call you that too?"」</p>
<p>The moment Kim Dokja heard that voice again, he stopped.</p>
<p>Whose memory is this?</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, or Shin Yoosoung in the 41st Round?</p>
<p>Or not,</p>
<p>'Are you okay?'</p>
<p>Is this a memory of Kim Dokja, who was the 'Demon King of Salvation'?</p>
<p>—What if I’m not okay?</p>
<p>For the first time, I felt a certain emotion in Kim Dokja's voice.</p>
<p>He spoke like a person who does not want to let go of those emotions.</p>
<p>'Isn't it okay to say that I miss her when I miss her?'</p>
<p>Why is he so cold? Was the Kim Dokja I knew really that kind of person?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>At least the 'Demon King of Salvation' I know is...</p>
<p>—Because that’s not my 'role'.</p>
<p>Role?</p>
<p>—It’s up to the other 'Kim Dokja' to feel sad when he sees people.</p>
<p>The moment I heard those words, all my questions suddenly seemed to make sense.</p>
<p>When he first saw Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, and Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p>The reason why the words Kim Dokja used to call them felt somehow distant and unfamiliar, could not be—</p>
<p>'Why is that?'</p>
<p>Any Kim Dokja has the right to be sad. It's nice to see someone you like and you can call them in a friendly way.</p>
<p>You can talk about your feelings.</p>
<p>But he didn't do that.</p>
<p>—Because I am 'The First, Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja was looking at Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, the beast that rose up from inside the Capitol, ran screaming.</p>
<p>He said, "Kim Dokja likes 'Ways of Survival'."</p>
<p>If seen from afar, it would have looked like black and white monsters swinging their claws at each other.</p>
<p>「Kim Dokja is more cold-hearted than anyone else.」</p>
<p>At the moment when Yoo Joonghyuk's claws caught on the tip of the fur of the 'Beast King's sensitivity', 'Unbreakable Faith' radiated light.</p>
<p>「Kim Dokja, who hates losses and hates Constellations.」</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk stumbled after being hit.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja pushed forward without giving him any time to rest.</p>
<p>「In order for all other 'Kim Dokjas' to exist, Kim Dokja had to survive before anyone else.」</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, who was on the defensive, activated his skill.</p>
<p>「Breaking the Sky Meteor Strike.」</p>
<p>The strongest skill that Yoo Joonghyuk can use now was revealed.</p>
<p>A bundle of force that tears the world apart poured towards me.</p>
<p>「Kim Dokja chose to become the Demon King to save someone.」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja was not embarrassed and slowly opened his arms. As if embracing a shattered world.</p>
<p>['Monster Gate' is activated.]</p>
<p>Dozens of portals swirled in the air, and Disaster-level monster species popped out at the same time.</p>
<p>The various breaths that poured out from the mouth of the monster species offset the bundle of strong energy of the broken meteor shower.</p>
<p>「He is the 'Demon King of Salvation'.」</p>
<p>As he slowly approached, a feeling of fear appeared in the black beast's pupils.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja smiled faintly, as if to appease Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>"I’ll just take what’s mine back."</p>
<p>The 'Kim Dokja fragment' that was stuck in Yoo Joonghyuk’s back was pulled out along with blood.</p>
<p>And at that very moment, the forgotten memories of the 'Demon King of Salvation' returned.</p>
