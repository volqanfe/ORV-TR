<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">619 Episode 13 King (3)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>Suddenly, I recalled the day when I boldly started my first web novel.</p>
<p>My first work was 『The Orc Philosopher』.</p>
<p>At the time, editor Ji Eunyu said after reading my novel.</p>
<p>「"Let’s leave aside the fact that the main character is an orc for now."」</p>
<p>Being an orc is a dislike. Check.</p>
<p>「"I'll leave aside being a philosopher."」</p>
<p>Philosophers have problems too. Check</p>
<p>「"The important thing starts here. The protagonist created by the writer is too inflexible."」</p>
<p>「"He’s not flexible?"」</p>
<p>「"Look at episode 2 here. As soon as he starts, he foolishly deals with a crisis that he can avoid without getting hit in the back of the head."」</p>
<p>I asked again while re-reading the sentence I had written.</p>
<p>「"But all the other novels also started with a blow to the back of the head?"」</p>
<p>「"If you get hit in the back of the head, you have to get up right away. Awaken, return, or possess! He doesn't have to do anything. What if he just keeps on despairing? We have to show unconventional movements."」</p>
<p>「"This protagonist is a schoolboy. Isn't schooling originally started out of despair?"」</p>
<p>「"And here is episode 6. Same thing. The main character is trying too hard."」</p>
<p>「"It's good to work hard, right?"」</p>
<p>「"If you go this far, there should be a reward."」</p>
<p>「"It's only been 30 years since then..."」</p>
<p>「"The average hero works 30 years and gets something!"」</p>
<p>「"He has come to the realization that there are things that can't be done even after 30 years."」</p>
<p>Ji Eunyoo ignored my words and pointed out the next episode.</p>
<p>「"And here, episode 15 is also a problem."」</p>
<p>「"There is a scene in which the main character saves the weak... Can’t this be done?"」</p>
<p>「"It's okay to save the weak, but if you helped the weak, the main character must also be rewarded. The main character also helped because he knew that implicitly. But look! Right now, the author's main character saves the weak, but is only misunderstood and pointed at!"」</p>
<p>I thought for a moment and asked.</p>
<p>「"Does it matter?"」</p>
<p>「"It’s important!"」</p>
<p>「"If you help in hopes of getting something in return, you're not really helping, right?"」</p>
<p>Ji Eunyoo looked at me curiously, and she replied:</p>
<p>「But this is the 'normal protagonist'’s way."」</p>
<p>「"Shouldn't the main character be normal?"」</p>
<p>「There was a time when an extraordinary protagonist was like a protagonist. The boys' cartoons of the 90's were like that. A noble and sublime protagonist. Protecting the weak, fighting against villains, deeply despairing, sometimes being caught and losing everything about oneself. Look at my other works these days. Are there many protagonists like that?"」</p>
<p>I thought.</p>
<p>Certainly, Ji Eunyoo seemed to be right.</p>
<p>「"Times have changed. Even if the genre is a delusion, it is a story that is one step further into the realm of reality."」</p>
<p>Ji Eunyoo continued as she looked down at the mixed coffee from the tearoom.</p>
<p>「"Readers now prefer ordinary people to become heroes. Because they can get identify in them. The person who replaces their daily small revenge. The protagonist who is not stuffy, has the right amount of flexibility, and is rewarded for his work. A protagonist who knows how to receive a proper reward. Most people don't even get that right."」</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, maybe it wasn't just about a novel.</p>
<p>It was because Ji Eunyoo's expression, as she said that, looked strangely tired.</p>
<p>「"If you just listen to the story, it seems that you are just a calculating person rather than a main character."」</p>
<p>「"Even if it is calculated, where does anyone do good things? In today's world, that's enough to qualify you as a main character."」</p>
<p>Ji Eunyoo's advice, like ready-made mixed coffee, had a sweet but bitter aftertaste.</p>
<p>「"It's the writer's job to make the misunderstood main character look likeable."」</p>
<p>The reason why the conversation at that time came to mind was probably because of the question Ye Hyunwoo received in front of him.</p>
<p>"I know you're talented. But do you really deserve to represent us?"</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo answered people's aggressive remarks without losing.</p>
<p>"There is no such thing as qualifications. But if you acknowledge it, a qualification will be created."</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo, who said that, was looking at the 'readers'.</p>
<p>He is talking to us - to me now.</p>
<p>He asked to be chosen as the protagonist of this stage.</p>
<p>「Is Ye Hyun-woo qualified to be the main character?」</p>
<p>I recalled the qualifications of the 'main character' listed by Ji Eunyoo.</p>
<p>1. Awaken, return, or possess.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo was possessed.</p>
<p>2. Be flexible.</p>
<p>His flexibility is overwhelming no matter how I look at it.</p>
<p>3. Be prudent.</p>
<p>Ye Hyeonwoo did not seem like a person who would make a losing trade.</p>
<p>You can tell just by looking at him that he demanded a 'new age' in exchange for hiding my secret.</p>
<p>4. Move for the weak and get paid.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo definitely moved for the weak.</p>
<p>Even in the 'emergency defense battle', without Ye Hyunwoo, there would surely be a greater loss of life.</p>
<p>Is he all there is? Even Ye Hyunwoo declared in front of everyone that he would protect everyone while using [Lie Detection].</p>
<p>He won't have [Incite] like I do, so the declaration must be genuine.</p>
<p>In return, he became a leading candidate for Chungmuro.</p>
<p>Up to this point, he had satisfied all the conditions of a protagonist these days that Ji Eunyoo said.</p>
<p>Besides, there must be a piece of Kim Dokja inside him.</p>
<p>There was no reason why he couldn't become the 'Kim Dokja' of this story.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>A corner of my heart continued to ache.</p>
<p>[The 'representative election' will begin in 30 seconds.]</p>
<p>It was then that Dansu-ahjussi grabbed my collar.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi, Hyunwoo-ssi can't. That kid is Jiyoon's friend."</p>
<p>Ahjussi's daughter, Jiyoon, was not yet an adult. She's probably a high school student.</p>
<p>If you were a friend of such a child, Ye Hyeonwoo would also be a teenager.</p>
<p>Thinking like that made Ye Hyeonwoo even more amazing.</p>
<p>A boy in his teens survived this far on his own and was challenging the representative of 'Chungmuro Station'.</p>
<p>However, just because the boy's ability is outstanding, am I willing to entrust the heavy burden to him?</p>
<p>[The management bureau withdraws the probable suitability decision.]</p>
<p>Just in time, the administration also expressed its intention.</p>
<p>[The Bureau of Management determines that there is no major problem with the probability of its existence.]</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kim Dokja's words came to mind.</p>
<p>That age and gender don't matter in this world.</p>
<p>But is it really okay? Is it really okay for this world to be like 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』?</p>
<p>"Don't worry, ahjussi."</p>
<p>I opened my mouth as if reassuring Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<p>"I won't let him do so."</p>
<p>It wasn't because I didn't trust Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p>The boy will keep his promises, and he will keep people safe.</p>
<p>The problem was then.</p>
<p>All enemies coming forward will aim for Ye Hyeonwoo's life. Just as Kim Dokja in the main story made so many sacrifices.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Red Mountain Army' is glaring at the incarnation 'Ye Hyeonwoo'.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Snake That Cut Off Its Tail' snorts at 'Ye Heonwoo's remarks.]</p>
<p>[Very few constellations think that the incarnation 'Ye Hyunwoo' is arrogant.]</p>
<p>Maybe it had already started.</p>
<p>A group of people who are hostile to Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p>Constellations of the Misreading Association and nearby great-level constellations were baring their teeth at him.</p>
<p>Ye Hyeonwoo's complexion turned slightly pale at the threats coming from everywhere, but he did not back down.</p>
<p>[Incarnation 'Yeh Hyunwoo' activates 'Lie detection'.]</p>
<p>Rather, he took a step further toward the center of Chungmuro Station and made a deal.</p>
<p>"For those who first agree to me becoming the representative, I will give that kind of benefit. And to those who do not agree with me becoming the representative-"</p>
<p>['Lie detection' has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p>
<p>"There will be absolutely no disadvantages. I will protect everyone here no matter what."</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo would know.</p>
<p>If he makes a mistake here, he could die.</p>
<p>He could be hated by the constellations and betrayed by people.</p>
<p>However, Ye Hyeonwoo did not give in and took courage.</p>
<p>It is probably because he read Kim Dokja’s story as hard as he did.</p>
<p>[Sub Scenario - Representative Election' begins.]</p>
<p>But he still doesn't feel it properly.</p>
<p>This world is no longer the 'Omniscient Reader' he knew.</p>
<fieldset>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">&lt;Sub Scenario: Election of representatives&gt;</h3>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: C</p>
<p>Clear condition: Occupy the 'white flag' installed in the center of the platform.</p>
<p>Time limit: 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Reward: 1,000 coins</p>
<p>Failure: —</p>
<p>* The representative of the station can exercise strong control over all members.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Along with the message, a 'white flag' appeared in the center of Chungmuro Station.</p>
<p>Up to that point, the development was the same as in the main story.</p>
<p>"Hey, it really showed up!"</p>
<p>The problem with the people who were surprised was the message that followed.</p>
<p>[If the red flag's owner is not changed 5 minutes after the flag is acquired, Chungmuro Station will come under the control of the flag owner.]</p>
<p>['Capturing the flag' changes the owner and resets the 5 minutes timer.]</p>
<p>['Capturing the flag' is recognized by killing the owner of the flag.]</p>
<p>For a moment, even my heart was thrilled.</p>
<p>A message that was not in the main story was added.</p>
<p>'Capture the flag is recognized by killing the owner of the flag'?</p>
<p>Of course, the location of the flag was right next to Ye Hyeonwoo.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo stretched out his trembling hand and said.</p>
<p>"If there is no objection, I will take it."</p>
<p>If you see a message like that, you might be intimidated enough, but Ye Hyunwoo was indeed determined. Probably because he has nowhere to back down.</p>
<p>"If you touch that now, we are enemies now."</p>
<p>As expected, the woman with steel bars – Goo Seonah, came forward. Next to her was Kim Gyeongsik, an old man with a smoking pipe.</p>
<p>"We haven't agreed to you being the representative yet."</p>
<p>They judged in an instant. At this rate, Ye Hyunwoo will become the representative of Chungmuro Station.</p>
<p>I just wanted to block that.</p>
<p>"Others, please say something!"</p>
<p>The people led by Goo Seonah and Kim Kyungsik also helped. Kim Kyungsik, who took a sip of his smoke pipe, opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"I heard your speech. But you left out an important part. That you are not the only one who is an 'apostle'.</p>
<p>Kim Kyungsik's words once again threw the hall into confusion.</p>
<p>"There may be friends I don’t know well yet, but there is not one 'apostle' in this world. Even if a few people like that boy know the future, there are more than a dozen of them. And I am one of them."</p>
<p>[Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice' opens his mouth.]</p>
<p>[Constellation, 'Heungmu the Great' asks if that is really possible.]</p>
<p>Kim Kyungsik continued the conversation without missing the timing when the incarnations were agitated.</p>
<p>"I know that Ye Hyunwoo has excellent qualities. But you are especially young among us. How can you become the representative of a group with a short social experience?"</p>
<p>For the first time, Ye Hyunwoo made an angry face when he talked about his age.</p>
<p>"Elderly people, I don’t think the original age is too much."</p>
<p>"Hum. What are you talking about? I'm on the younger side of my mental age, but I'm older than you."</p>
<p>"There's no law that says you're wiser just because you're older. And the important skill in this world is how well you can remember and use 'Revelation'."</p>
<p>"I also read Revelation six times-"</p>
<p>"Only six times."</p>
<p>Kim Kyungsik's face turned red.</p>
<p>"I've read it fifty times."</p>
<p>To that number once again, some readers exclaimed.</p>
<p>Certainly, fifty is an insane number.</p>
<p>You could say it's crazy to read a single novel 50 times, but it's a novel that reaches 551 chapters in its entirety.</p>
<p>"Wait, if it's the order of reading a lot..."</p>
<p>It was then that the reaction of readers became strange. A few people's eyes moved slowly towards us.</p>
<p>Something came to mind later.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, among them, there were those who saw the confrontation between the uploaders of the Misreading Association and me from the 'theater dungeon'.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein, seizing the opportunity, raised her hand.</p>
<p>"Hey, if the number of times you read the Book of Revelation is the condition for being a representative, then I have something to say."</p>
<p>“Kyung Sein, you are not on the level to be here."</p>
<p>In response to Ye Hyunwoo’s unusually cold voice, Kyung Sein nodded and replied.</p>
<p>"Yes. But that's not what I'm talking about."</p>
<p>"So?"</p>
<p>Kyung Sein hesitated and continued talking.</p>
<p>"As far as I know, there are people here who have read the book of Revelation over a hundred times."</p>
<p>"What nonsense are you talking about?"</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo had a strangely angry tone.</p>
<p>Well, according to the information obtained so far, for the apostles, the number of complete readings was their pride.</p>
<p>Perhaps the standard for ranking the 7 apostles is the number of times the story has been read.</p>
<p>"I've read the book of Revelation 50 times. People who have read more than me are-"</p>
<p>"There are a few, you know."</p>
<p>Officially, the 7th Apostle, Ye Hyunwoo, is a first-class member of the Apostolic Society.</p>
<p>It meant that there were six people who had read all the novel more than him.</p>
<p>"There is, but not here."</p>
<p>Among them, only the 2nd Apostle Killer King is at Chungmuro Station now.</p>
<p>However, Killer King is in a state of resting after eating the 'Essence of the Elaine Forest'.</p>
<p>"But there is one person here."</p>
<p>['Lie detection' has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p>
<p>"Who the hell?"</p>
<p>Then, Kyung Sein took a fancy pose and pointed at me with both hands.</p>
<p>Suddenly receiving everyone's attention, I lightly bowed toward the surroundings with an awkward smile on my face.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo looked at me in disbelief.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Is that statement true?"</p>
<p>There's no need to lie here.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Please answer honestly. Inho-ssi, how many times have you read the 'Revelation'?"</p>
<p>[Incarnation 'Ye Hyunwoo' is activating 'Lie Detection'.]</p>
<p>"That’s a hundred times—"</p>
<p>At my words, Ye Hyunwoo laughed.</p>
<p>"You must be kidding. No matter how much you read, I can’t believe that much..."</p>
<p>['Lie detection' has confirmed that the statement is false.]</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo looked at me as if to see that.</p>
<p>I have continued the broken words.</p>
<p>"More than a hundred times. One hundred and ten times? One hundred and twenty? To be honest, I’m not sure because I didn’t count."</p>
<p>['Lie Detection' has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo’s expression hardened.</p>
<p>A heavy silence swept through Chungmuro.</p>
<p>He was silent, partly because he did not understand what I meant, and partly because he understood what I meant.</p>
<p>The first to speak was the group in the back.</p>
<p>"That rumor... was it true?"</p>
<p>"Is there really a madman who has read it over a hundred times?"</p>
<p>Several readers who already knew the number of times I had read the book trembled, and Goo Seonah and Kim Kyungsik also shook their heads.</p>
<p>"The author is not Kim Dokja, but I'm sure he's not as insane as Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>"It's a strange number of times to hear it again. But did Kim Dokja read 'Ways of Survival' that many times?"</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo, who had maintained his composure from beginning to end, could not hide his agitation this time.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>"There is only one person in this world who has officially read the Book of Revelation more than a hundred times. Inho-ssi, maybe you…"</p>
<p>For the first time, faint agitation was shown in Ye Hyunwoo's eyes.</p>
<p>"The head of the Apostolic Society….. are you the 'first apostle'?"</p>
<p>It seems that this is the start of an unwanted illusion.</p>
