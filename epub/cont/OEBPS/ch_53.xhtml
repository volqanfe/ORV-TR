<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">605 Episode 10. Writer (6)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>Feeling his heart rapidly grow cold, Jung Jaewoo trembled with fear.</p>
<p>「I’m scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared.」</p>
<p>Dying. He was dying now.</p>
<p>[Oh, what a pity. It's okay. Don't worry.]</p>
<p>Someone was talking to him while holding the back of his neck.</p>
<p>[You're not going to die.]</p>
<p>A dark, bleak voice.</p>
<p>Jung Jaewoo realized whose voice it was.</p>
<p>It was 'RepresentativeKimDokja'.</p>
<p>[There's a story you need to see.]</p>
<p>A story. When Jung Jaewoo heard that, his heart suddenly beat.</p>
<p>His dying body was reviving.</p>
<p>Was this how Kim Dokja felt when he was resurrected with the power of the “King of No Killing”?</p>
<p>The thoughts that he shouldn't have read the novel disappeared.</p>
<p>I'm glad I read this story after all.</p>
<p>Then he felt his head, hands, legs, and body regenerate.</p>
<p>Jung Jaewoo opened his eyes as much as he could.</p>
<p>He was sitting in front of the movie theater screen.</p>
<p>For some reason, his mind was clouded.</p>
<p>The memories from a while ago flashed through his mind one by one.</p>
<p>The day he went to the theater dungeon, meeting the readers, meeting Cheon Inho and Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>He had a fight with a human claiming to be a writer.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>「"Jaewoo-ssi."」</p>
<p>A man's face appeared on the screen. And with his eyes closed, he could see his own body without any movement.</p>
<p>I’m dead.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, he didn't feel sad or distressed. Because the story was still going on in front of his eyes.</p>
<p>「"Jaewoo-ssi."」</p>
<p>Looking at Cheon Inho holding his hand and shaking his body, Jung Jaewoo thought.</p>
<p>As expected, this story is really great.</p>
<p>This story, I want to watch it a little more.</p>
<p>[Of course. You can do that forever.]</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja tapped him on the shoulder and disappeared.</p>
<p>Jung Jaewoo blankly stared at the screen.</p>
<p>On the screen was a grieving Cheon Inho. As soon as he faced Cheon Inho, Jung Jaewoo felt the providence of faraway stories.</p>
<p>He lost himself little by little while swimming in that universe of stories.</p>
<p>Who was I?</p>
<p>But still, looking at Cheon Inho, who was sitting with a despairing face, he wanted to tell him something.</p>
<p>I'm okay. I'm still here, even though I've been dragged into a strange little space, I'm reading this story.</p>
<p>Then a small keypad appeared in front of his eyes.</p>
<p>He stared down at the keypad and wrote a word.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>rlaehrwk41: What kind of thing is this?</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Then, a kkoma Kim Dokja, who was next to him, looked back at him.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>rlaehrwk37: New here?</p>
</fieldset>
<p>On the chest of the kkoma Kim Dokja was a name tag with rlaehrwk37 written on it.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>rlaehrwk37: I worked hard to save you, but you died.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>He casually looked down at his chest.</p>
<p>“rlaehrwk41.”</p>
<p>rlaehrwk41 looked down at his name tag for a while before asking.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>rlaehrwk41: Who are you?</p>
<p>rlaehrwk37: Who is it? Everyone is in the same situation as you. Do you know ‘Daknunsam’ for newcomers?</p>
<p>rlaehrwk41: What's ‘Daknunsam’?</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Then rlaehrwk37 said with a serious face.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>rlaehrwk37 : Shut up and watch for three days until you figure out what’s going on.</p>
</fieldset>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
<p>It rained.</p>
<p>Under a dense broad-leaved forest that can escape the rain, I buried Jung Jaewoo's body.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Commander of the Red Cosmos', looks at you.]</p>
<p>At his moment of death, Jung Jaewoo was smiling mysteriously.</p>
<p>Why? He said he regretted reading this novel, so why did he die smiling like that?</p>
<p>Could it be the last amount of [Little Luck] influencing him?</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire', comforts you.]</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Lily Blooming In Aquarius', sponsors 100 coins.]</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', asks why you bury them when they’ll disappear anyway.]</p>
<p>The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon was right.</p>
<p>When this movie ends, this world disappears. Then Jung Jaewoo's body will also disappear.</p>
<p>I know that.</p>
<p>But it was the same everywhere, not just here. The earth, solar system, and the galaxy will disappear someday.</p>
<p>But we bury the dead in the ground. I don't know why.</p>
<p>All I can tell is a story about a novel. Some sentences only become meaningful when they are buried between sentences and not revealed.</p>
<p>Maybe that's what death is like.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon did not wake up right away.</p>
<p>I followed the footsteps of the script writer with Jung Heewon on my back. The footprints were cut off at some point.</p>
<p>There was a jar, “Yongjun”, which was dropped by the broken footprint.</p>
<p>I hung Yongjun around my waist.</p>
<p>If his injuries were enough to drop even his main item, he would be dead or dying somewhere by now.</p>
<p>I stopped tracking the script writer.</p>
<p>[Reach the end of the movie.]</p>
<p>Getting rid of him is important, but for now, escaping from this movie was the first priority. In the end, you have to see the end to return to the original world.</p>
<p>After losing Jung Jaewoo, Jung Heewon also passed out.</p>
<p>If I ever run into the “starter” who was hiding by himself, my team would be doomed.</p>
<p>「We must not lose anyone anymore.」</p>
<p>After covering Jung Heewon with my coat, I continued to walk in the rain. In the middle of the rain and sweat mixed, even the floor was muddy and my steps were heavy.</p>
<p>Groooh!</p>
<p>Occasionally, when I hear the roar of a giant monster, I lean for a moment under the trunk of a tree.</p>
<p>I caught my breath.</p>
<p>The film ends when we escape from this island.</p>
<p>I'll probably have to go to the research center in the center of the island this time too.</p>
<p>[The theater owner hates the mediocre ending.]</p>
<p>Sparks intermittently fell from the gloomy sky.</p>
<p>[The theater owner accepts the proposal of the constellation 'Snake That Cut Off Its Tail'.]</p>
<p>[The constellation, ‘Snake That Cut Off Its Tail’, unravels its story.]</p>
<p>[The composition of the stage is partially changed]</p>
<p>[A black moon has risen on the stage.]</p>
<p>[Some monstrosities evolve under the blessing of the constellation 'Snake That Cut Off Its Tail'!]</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger', advises you to hurry.]</p>
<p>With an eerie feeling running down my spine, I hurried my steps. But the research wing was too far, and they were getting closer.</p>
<p>I could see the grass swaying in all directions as if chasing prey.</p>
<p>In the end, I put Jung Heewon down and took the damaged bamboo pole in my hand.</p>
<p>Grrr.</p>
<p>A group of red-eyed raptors emerged from the grass.</p>
<p>[The 8th-grade earth dragon, 'Raptor', reveals its intent to kill you.]</p>
<p>One two three four… eight in total. Each one is a level 8 monster, but when gathered together, they are monsters that can even hunt level 7 monsters.</p>
<p>[Activate the exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.6'!]</p>
<p>"I am a raptor. I am not your enemy"</p>
<p>I tried telling it just in case, but it didn't work.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Snake That Cut Off Its Tail', smirks.]</p>
<p>The power of someone stronger than the instigation was ruling them.</p>
<p>「I am Yoo Joonghyuk.」</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, ‘Incite Lv.6’, is activated!]</p>
<p>I smashed the raptor's head with the bamboo pole and amortized it.</p>
<p>「Seeing that '□□' didn't activate, I'm not in danger of dying.」</p>
<p>But what about Jung Heewon?</p>
<p>I aimed my bamboo stick at the surroundings, protecting Jung Heewon who leaned against the trunk of a tree.</p>
<p>Should I spend coins on stats?</p>
<p>Or should I buy a new skill?</p>
<p>[Possessed coins: 25,400 C]</p>
<p>No good method came to mind.</p>
<p>Even if I hunted all the raptors, it was a problem.</p>
<p>The raptors I'm facing now were weak even in this stage.</p>
<p>Quadduk!</p>
<p>Taking advantage of my carelessness, a raptor bit my arm.</p>
<p>I cracked the guy's head with the tip of the bamboo stick. Shaking off the dripping blood, I activated [Incite] once again.</p>
<p>"I am Tyrannosaurus Rex."</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.6', is activated!]</p>
<p>"Hmm," I breathed in, and let out the loudest shout I could.</p>
<p>Whoaaaaaaa!</p>
<p>At that moment, the bodies of the raptors who were aiming at me stiffened.</p>
<p>I took a step forward and let out another roar.</p>
<p>Aaaaaaaa!</p>
<p>As the first raptor ran away, the second raptor immediately turned its back. Three, four, five… In an instant, all but the two fighters I knocked down ran away.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p>
<p>I internally let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>My throat was sore from the excessive roar.</p>
<p>Go go go…</p>
<p>It was then that the nearby ground began to vibrate.</p>
<p>I had an ominous feeling.</p>
<p>「Is it really because of me that the raptors ran away?」</p>
<p>The broad-leaved trees on the left collapsed, and the front claws of a giant terrestrial dragon appeared.</p>
<p>Oh oh oh oh!</p>
<p>[A 7th grade earth dragon, 'Tyrannosaurus Rex', has appeared!]</p>
<p>In the main story, Lee Jihye, Jung Heewon, and Kim Dokja worked together to catch the monster.</p>
<p>But now, Kim Dokja and Lee Jihye were not here, and Jung Heewon was also in a state of fainting.</p>
<p>Codedeuk!</p>
<p>A huge tail came flying, breaking all nearby trees.</p>
<p>I wrapped my body around Jung Heewon and rolled on the floor.</p>
<p>Blood continued to flow from the arm that had been hit by the raptor.</p>
<p>It was not an opponent that could be defeated in a one-on-one fight.</p>
<p>After all, my main skill is [Incite]. What should I do to [Incite] to scare him?</p>
<p>「How far can I [Incite] this world?」</p>
<p>With all my imagination, I recalled the most powerful dragon I know.</p>
<p>A monster that can't be compared to a 7th grade dragon.</p>
<p>Did they realize what I'm trying to do? There was already a sign of a probability storm throughout my body.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Snake That Cut Off Its Tail', blinks.]</p>
<p>"I am."</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv. 6', is activated!]</p>
<p>I slowly opened my mouth.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', realizes your intentions and is surprised.]</p>
<p>To save Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>And at the end of this theater, to meet Yoo Joonghyuk once again.</p>
<p>"Apocalypse."</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv. 6', is being pushed to the limit!]</p>
<p>There was a pain as if all my cells were being squeezed.</p>
<p>Now all I have to do is spit out the last word.</p>
<p>Last one, the last word.</p>
<p>The Tyrannosaurus Rex's front claws moved towards me.</p>
<p>Tsucheucheucheucheucheucheut!</p>
<p>My tongue stiffened as if something was covering my mouth. The last word was not uttered.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes tightly.</p>
<p>「If I die, will I become a kkoma Kim Dokja?」</p>
<p>A flash of light flashed in the pale darkness created by my eyelids. Then I heard a thump and something rolling on the floor.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes, I saw a clear blue-white ether blade and the Tyrannosaurus, who fell down after losing his front foot.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>The familiar faces of the brother and sister were seen beyond the brilliant [Purest Sword Force].</p>
<p>Killer King, who had read ORV 99.8 times, was there.</p>
<p>"You, why are you here?"</p>
<fieldset>
<p>rlaehrwk41: Those are the people who saved me.</p>
</fieldset>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
<p>Yeom Ilwoo, the script writer, was running while swearing.</p>
<p>'Damn it! Damn it!'</p>
<p>The battle that had just happened was still vivid in his mind. From a madman who said he read ORV 100 times, to a crazy woman who killed a 7th grade alien species.</p>
<p>"Wow!"</p>
<p>A madwoman's throw tore his arm apart, knocking him down, and a newbie chasing after him thrusted his sword into his thigh, making his maneuver difficult.</p>
<p>He had made a hole in the newbie’s heart, but thanks to that, he too was in danger of dying soon.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'King of Gambling', bestows good luck on you.]</p>
<p>What saved him was his sponsor.</p>
<p>Yeom Ilwoo, the script writer, passed through a broad-leaved forest area with amazing luck, avoided a group of dinosaurs, and eventually succeeded in entering the “Central Research Building” first.</p>
<p>He even discovered a “hidden tunnel” that led directly from the research building to the upper floors.</p>
<p>[You are the first to enter the research building!]</p>
<p>[Do you want to enter the “Hidden Tunnel”?]</p>
<p>[When entering the tunnel, the stairs are randomly skipped.]</p>
<p>[50% chance to reach the 3rd floor, 40% chance to reach the 4th floor, 10% chance to reach the 5th floor.]</p>
<p>Yeom Ilwoo entered the tunnel without hesitation.</p>
<p>[“King of Dice” is activated!]</p>
<p>[Enter the 5th floor!]</p>
<p>5th floor.</p>
<p>The place where the rewards were located.</p>
<p>Young Ilwoo stepped onto the fifth floor, unable to hide his excitement.</p>
<p>Although he lost two of his teammates and even dropped Yongjun on the way back, luck was still on his side.</p>
<p>Yeom Ilwoo found a woman who arrived on the 5th floor before him.</p>
<p>"Hey, look. Are you alone?"</p>
<p>A short woman in a white coat.</p>
<p>As soon as he checked the woman's face, Yeom Ilwoo's face brightened.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'King of Gambling', says you can't go that way.]</p>
<p>Yeom Ilwoo ignored him.</p>
<p>No matter who it was, it was an 'incarnation' who was here anyway, and with a high probability of being a 'reader'. And he was confident in deceiving any reader with his words.</p>
<p>There surely can't be two crazy people who've read ORV 100 times.</p>
<p>Above all, the woman's face was beautiful.</p>
<p>"Let's team up together. I am the author of this novel! You heard it earlier, right? 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint’—"</p>
<p>As soon as Yeom Ilwoo reached for the woman with a faint smile, an eerie sound split the air.</p>
<p>Yeom Ilwoo did not know what happened until the moment his neck rolled down.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'King of Gambling', checks his eyes in astonishment!]</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Sneaky Schemer', glares at the 'King of Gambling'.]</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'King of Gambling', hastily leaves the channel.]</p>
<p>The woman staring at Yeom Ilwoo's head rolling on the floor smiled.</p>
<p>"It's a little bit, but you can't use an avatar?"</p>
<p>The woman lightly brushed off the blood from her sword and looked back after she wiped the blade.</p>
<p>"Hey, you."</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>“Kim Namwoon, Lee Hyunsung, aren't you awake yet?"</p>
<p>Kim Namwoon, who was lying behind her, staggered and raised himself. And with a bizarre smile, he said.</p>
<p>"You're really strong. Kekeke. But compared to our leader– Keuhaha!"</p>
<p>Kim Namwoon, who was hit in the back of the head, instantly fainted.</p>
<p>"As expected, you were awake. Don't wake up."</p>
<p>The woman dragged Kim Namwoon, who quietly passed out, and Lee Hyunsung, who suddenly began to snore, upstairs.</p>
<p>"Hey, what floor is Yoo Joonghyuk on?"</p>
<p>When the woman asked, Lee Hyunsung's snoring stopped.</p>
<p>Then the woman said.</p>
<p>"Not you, Lee Hyunsung."</p>
<p>Lee Hyunsung began to snore again, and the answer came from the air.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Sneaky Schemer', says he is now on the last floor.]</p>
<p>The woman let out a light sigh, and once again a message was heard in the air.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Sneaky Schemer', says everyone is worried.]</p>
<p>"Don't worry."</p>
<p>[The constellation, ‘Sneaky Schemer', is…]</p>
<p>"It's noisy."</p>
<p>After receiving an answer, Han Sooyoung looked at the torn movie posters for a while. These are probably the films that Yoo Joonghyuk ripped up.</p>
<p>「Originally, she had never come to this theater.」</p>
<p>In the third turn, when Kim Dokja cleared the Theater Dungeon, she was somewhere else.</p>
<p>However, she knew what Kim Dokja said here.</p>
<p>「"I made a wish to see the epilogue of a certain novel."」</p>
<p>Did Kim Dokja, who said that at the time, know that this story would be so long?</p>
<p>「Are you still curious about the end of this world?」</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung left the torn poster and looked up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>Maybe Kim Dokja was still reading this story somewhere.</p>
<p>As if talking to Kim Dokja, Han Sooyoung muttered.</p>
<p>"You keep reading from there. Because I'll do my job."</p>
<p>Putting an end to the story, and bringing the reader back to reality.</p>
<p>That was the author's role.</p>
