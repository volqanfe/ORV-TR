<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">722 Episode 27 Recycling Center (5)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>Throughout the rounds of 'Ways of Survival', Yoo Joonghyuk lost his memory several times.</p>
<p>At the edge of the 800th Round, he met an outer deity belonging to the 'Great Ancient One' and his spirit collapsed.</p>
<p>Around the 1150th Round, he was caught up in the Giant Nebula's 'Regressor Dissection Plan' and became a test subject for the Nebula for a while.</p>
<p>Sometimes, like when 'Mad Soldier Yoo Joonghyuk' was born through a wrong transfusion of Lee Hyunsung’s military stories, not only did he lose his memory, but his personality itself completely changed.</p>
<p>But has he ever become as small as he is now?</p>
<p>At least it doesn't appear in the 'Ways of Survival' that I remember. Of course, it appears once in 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'…</p>
<p>Watching Yoo Joonghyuk move his small hands to put on his battle boots, I had a really strange feeling.</p>
<p>Should we really recognize this creature as Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'The One Who Won the Rat' thinks the 'little rat' is cute.]</p>
<p>Is there something going wrong in this world?</p>
<p>"You’re a really good runner."</p>
<p>One by one, the incarnations who had completed acquiring their respective prizes gathered by my side.</p>
<p>"It was an amazing response. I never thought you would use stories in such a way... It would be nice if we could work in the same area at the Center."</p>
<p>"Which district will you choose? Why not join us?"</p>
<p>"I’m holding the 'pig' side of the line. If you join me, I can connect you to that side too…"</p>
<p>Same area. Apparently, the 'Recycling Center' is divided into sections.</p>
<p>[The lower level of the 'Recycling Center' is the area of the Nebula 'Zodiac'.]</p>
<p>Also.</p>
<p>[1st, 2nd, and 3rd places in the 'Zodiac Race' will be given 'Zone Priority Selection'.]</p>
<p>I answered, asking for understanding from the gathered incarnations.</p>
<p>"I’m sorry, but I don’t have any plans to choose a specific faction yet."</p>
<p>Of course, it would be nice to get on the line. But now was not the time to make that decision.</p>
<p>Some of the incarnations looked disappointed at my answer, while others frowned and swore.</p>
<p>Bicheonhori, who was watching the scene from the side, nodded his head. He didn't show any signs of being angry or disappointed with my choice.</p>
<p>"Good. Choosing nothing is also a choice."</p>
<p>"Nowadays, such choices have become commonplace."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Bicheonhori must have thought what I said was interesting, so he took out a notebook and started writing down something.</p>
<p>"You said your name was 'Kim Dokja', right?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Come to think of it, he was the person who wrote the famous book on characters, "The 100 Strongest People".</p>
<p>Bicheonhori must have noticed my gaze and made an answer.</p>
<p>"Oh, because records are my hobby."</p>
<p>Is it okay?</p>
<p>What would happen if 'Kim Dokja’ was listed as one the 'Strongest 100 People'? I guess that means the future will be transformed too seriously.</p>
<p>"Hmm. I guess this is what happens this time…"</p>
<p>This time?</p>
<p>Bicheonhori muttered something meaningful and smiled slightly as he looked at me.</p>
<p>"I hope we get a chance to meet again, young man."</p>
<p>Did something just change in his tone of voice?</p>
<p>With those last words, Bicheonhori chose his 'Zone' and disappeared into the Recycling Center.</p>
<p>I felt a little disappointed, but I didn't really care. Since we were destined to go to the same 'Recycling Center' anyway, there would be another opportunity to talk, as he said.</p>
<p>I checked the ‘zone selection message’ that appeared before my eyes.</p>
<p>[You can select a total of 12 areas.]</p>
<p>[Select an entry area.]</p>
<p>As previously explained, the 'lower level' of the Recycling Center is the area of the Nebula Zodiac.</p>
<p>There were twelve zones according to the tendencies of each Zodiac Sign, and incarnations could choose the zone they wanted.</p>
<p>[Zone 1 - Rat-district (자 동)]</p>
<p>[Zone 2 - Bull-district (축 동)]</p>
<p>[Zone 3 - Tiger-district (인 동)]</p>
<p>[Zone 4 - Rabbit-district (묘 동)]</p>
<p>[Zone 5 - Dragon-district (진 동)]</p>
<p>[Zone 6 - Snake-district (사 동)]</p>
<p>[Zone 7 - Horse-district (오 동)]</p>
<p>[Zone 8 - Goat-district (미 동)]</p>
<p>[Zone 9 - Monkey-district (신 동)]</p>
<p>[Zone 10 - Rooster-district (유 동)]</p>
<p>[Zone 11 - Dog-district (술 동)]</p>
<p>[Zone 12 - Pig-district (해 동)]</p>
<p>From the rat that belongs to 'Ja' to the pig that belongs to 'hae'.</p>
<p>If I were  Dansu ahjussi or Sein-ssi, which one would I have chosen?</p>
<p>Looking at the results, little Yoo Joonghyuk was also staring at the options with serious eyes.</p>
<p>"Which one will you choose?"</p>
<p>"It’s none of your business."</p>
<p>Of course you would say this.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'The One Who Won the Rat' recommends Zone 2 – 'Bull-district' to you.]</p>
<p>The One Who Won the Rat.</p>
<p>Judging by the modifier, that Constellation was the Constellation corresponding to 'Bull' in the Zodiac.</p>
<p>Considering that I came in second place in the Zodiac Race and that one of the Constellations that sponsored me in the beginning was the 'original bull', it wasn't a bad idea to choose 'Bull-district', which corresponds to 'bull'.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'The Dog That Threw Itself into the Flames' pays attention to your choice.]</p>
<p>Zone 11, Dog-district, represented by 'dog', was also worth considering. 'The Dog That Threw Itself into the Flames' is the only Constellation that took Kim Dokja’s side even in the main story. Maybe this is the time to build a relationship.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' pays attention to your choice.]</p>
<p>Nail-Eating Rat.</p>
<p>Were you watching too?</p>
<p>If I was conscious of the 'Zodiac Race', it was also a good idea to select Zone 1, where the winner of the story, the 'Rat', belongs.</p>
<p>However, on the 'rat' and 'snake' side, there are Constellations of the Misreading Association.</p>
<p>If you want to catch a tiger, you have to go into the tiger's den. One way would be to choose their base...</p>
<p>Tiger.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I had forgotten about the 'Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake'.</p>
<p>Considering my promise to him, Zone 3 'Tiger-district' was a good choice. The 'Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake' has helped me and shown me favor at times.</p>
<p>It's strange that the indirect message of 'Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake' is not heard at all, but...</p>
<p>In addition, I could also choose 'Zone 5 - Dragon-district', represented by the dragon, or 'Zone 9- Monkey-district', represented by the monkey.</p>
<p>[1 minute left to complete selection.]</p>
<p>My worries didn't last long.</p>
<p>Because now I am 'Kim  Dokja'. And what Kim Dokja will say in the face of this choice is decided.</p>
<p>"I will not choose any district."</p>
<p>"I will not choose any district."</p>
<p>If Ji Eunyu were next to me, she would have said, "Writer, the lines here have been copied."</p>
<p>But I didn't say it twice.</p>
<p>"You there."</p>
<p>Those words were just said by the little boy next to me, Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>"Don’t copy me."</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders without answering.</p>
<p>Afterwards, indirect messages flew in one after another from thin air.</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'The Dog That Threw Itself into the Flames' asks if you are sincere.]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'the Pig in the Brick House' respects your choice.]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' feels sorry for you.]</p>
<p>Several people who confirmed my choice also voiced concerns.</p>
<p>"Are you serious? This friend is out of his mind."</p>
<p>"Hehe, you didn’t choose the Chinese Zodiac Signs? That’s ridiculous—"</p>
<p>[This decision cannot be undone.]</p>
<p>[Do you want to keep this selection?]</p>
<p>I know it's a risky choice.</p>
<p>However, if you choose a certain Zodiac Sign, you will eventually fall under the Constellation to which that Zodiac Sign belongs.</p>
<p>I don't want that situation. The 'Demon King of Salvation' must have had the same thought.</p>
<p>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' nods.]</p>
<p>Little Yoo Joonghyuk and I nodded at the same time. Afterwards, a halo of light came down from the air and embraced us warmly.</p>
<p>[You did not select any 'Zodiac Sign'.]</p>
<p>[Hidden options are activated.]</p>
<p>[A new achievement has been achieved.]</p>
<p>[Zone 13 – Move to 'Void-district'.]</p>
<p>Zone 13, huh.</p>
<p>As expected, there was an option not to choose a 'Zodiac Sign'.</p>
<p>What unfolded before my eyes along with the warp was a city with flashing neon signs. The buildings are somehow reminiscent of the Earth of the near future. The lights of a skyscraper flashing in the distance.</p>
<p>No matter how you look at it, it was a scene that was somewhat far from the world view of the 'Zodiac'.</p>
<p>This is Zone 13?</p>
<p>[Linked scenario activates!]</p>
<fieldset>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">&lt;Main Scenario #8 - Zone 13&gt;</h3>
<p>Category: Main</p>
<p>Difficulty:???</p>
<p>Clear conditions: ???</p>
<p>Time limit: —</p>
<p>compensation: ???</p>
<p>Failure: —</p>
</fieldset>
<p>The title of the main scenario was also changed. However, key details such as clear conditions and rewards were still not revealed.</p>
<p>We have to find out for ourselves.</p>
<p>[Linked scenario activates!]</p>
<p>[An 'event scenario' occurs every night in this area.]</p>
<p>It is an event scenario that occurs every night.</p>
<p>This feels a bit like déjà vu.</p>
<p>[You can obtain rewards when you survive the event scenario.]</p>
<p>As I lightly scanned the street, I saw incarnations glancing at us.</p>
<p>Most of them were beasts.</p>
<p>A giraffe with one leg replaced by a machine. An elephant with broken tusks. A lion with all its fur removed and one eye missing.</p>
<p>Looking closely, I saw that it wasn't just the prisoners. Other races with animal origins, such as orcs and gnomes, were also seen.</p>
<p>What they have in common is that they are also equipped with mechanical arms or mechanical legs.</p>
<p>It was a worldview reminiscent of cyberpunk.</p>
<p>[Tonight’s event is 'The Three Little Pigs'.]</p>
<p>[Find an 'accommodation' before the event starts and survive.]</p>
<p>[One hour left until the event starts.]</p>
<p>Still, there was a good beginner's guide.</p>
<p>One hour isn't that much time. I need to hurry up a bit.</p>
<p>I glanced at little Yoo Joonghyuk and started walking away, leaving him behind.</p>
<p>I felt someone following me a few steps away.</p>
<p>After walking about twenty steps, I deliberately stopped. Then the sound of following footsteps disappeared.</p>
<p>As I started walking again, the sound of hesitant footsteps followed.</p>
<p>I grinned and looked back.</p>
<p>"Why are you following me?"</p>
<p>Little Yoo Joonghyuk, startled, froze in place.</p>
<p>"Because I’m suspicious of you."</p>
<p>This was little Yoo Joonghyuk, who followed me eagerly, dragging his big boots.</p>
<p>If the Demon King of Salvation had heard this, he would never have believed it.</p>
<p>"Tie your shoelaces properly."</p>
<p>"It’s tied up."</p>
<p>The shoelaces were tied in a mess.</p>
<p>"Do you know that there is a special option for those shoes?"</p>
<p>"Special options?"</p>
<p>"How much did you forget?"</p>
<p>Would I have felt this way if I had a younger sibling?</p>
<p>If I had a younger sibling, I thought it would be a good kid like Yoosoung.</p>
<p>I bowed lightly. Little Yoo Joonghyuk took a step back as if on guard, but my hands were faster.</p>
<p>"This is how we tie it."</p>
<p>'Battle Boots of the Noble One' activates special options when the shoelaces are tightened and tied in a specific way.</p>
<p>[The special option of the item 'Battle Boots of the Noble One' is activated!]</p>
<p>The basics of Yoo Joonghyuk, these battle boots had 'solid durability' and 'resistance to various properties'.</p>
<p>In addition, as an auxiliary option, 'phenomenal elasticity' can be activated, and the size can be adjusted comprehensively to the extent that it can handle Yoo Joonghyuk, who activated 'Gigantification'.</p>
<p>[The size of the item changes to suit the wearer!]</p>
<p>Little Yoo Joonghyuk asked, looking down at the battle boots that had been tightened to fit his feet.</p>
<p>"You, how do you know this?"</p>
<p>"Are you surprised that I know how to tie my shoelaces?"</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>"I want to ask you how you don’t know any of this."</p>
<p>"Is my name 'Yoo Joonghyuk'?"</p>
<p>I quietly looked into the eyes of little Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>According to my guess, the reason why Yoo Joonghyuk lost his memory was due to the side effects of 'Story Imprint'.</p>
<p>I don’t know, but it’s probably because of 'Restraint of Truth' or 'Restraint of Emotions'.</p>
<p>Even looking back, it was strange that Yoo Joonghyuk's combat power, when he became the 'Black Beast', did not suffer the aftereffects of probability.</p>
<p>"Yes. You are a dirt eater."</p>
<p>"I don’t eat dirt."</p>
<p>"Once you try it, you might change your mind."</p>
<p>"Do you want to die?"</p>
<p>"If you kill me, you will never know who you are."</p>
<p>Little Yoo Joonghyuk thought about something for a moment, then frowned and asked.</p>
<p>"What is your name?"</p>
<p>"It is Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>"That’s a strange name."</p>
<p>"I’m sick of hearing things like that."</p>
<p>Even though we didn't really talk, I somehow felt nostalgic.</p>
<p>"What else do you know about me?"</p>
<p>"Before that, what do you remember?"</p>
<p>"Ten days."</p>
<p>"Ten days?"</p>
<p>"After ten days, most of my memories will return."</p>
<p>Ten days. That's enough time.</p>
<p>"And that we have to find the stolen equipment."</p>
<p>"When was the equipment taken away?"</p>
<p>"I don’t know. It was like this when I woke up."</p>
<p>I think he lost it while climbing up the 'Star Ladder'.</p>
<p>Considering that Battle Boots were released as a product from the 'Recycling Center', key items such as 'Infinite Dimension Subspace Coat' and 'Wolgeuk' could have been in a similar situation.</p>
<p>Even if nothing else was known, 'Wolgeuk' had to be recovered. That's Yoo Joonghyuk's key weapon in the 41st Round.</p>
<p>"And..."</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"I have to meet a guy named Cheon Inho."</p>
<p>I paused for a moment.</p>
<p>"Why him?"</p>
<p>"I don’t know. I just remember that I have to meet that bastard. When I meet that bastard—"</p>
<p>I quietly grabbed the dirt from the floor. If this little guy remembered anything, I was going to throw dirt in his mouth and run away.</p>
<p>"I thought I could last at least ten days before I recovered my memory."</p>
<p>I was dazed for a moment and then looked down at the dirt in my hands. When I opened my tightly clenched fist, dirt flowed down.</p>
<p>I felt fortunate that I was still wearing the mask.</p>
<p>"I will accompany you for about ten days. I will help you not die."</p>
<p>"What are you planning?"</p>
<p>I said, holding out my right hand covered in dirt.</p>
<p>"There are conditions."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk nodded as if he knew that would happen.</p>
<p>"Say it."</p>
<p>"You can’t kill me after ten days."</p>
<p>Little Yoo Joonghyuk looked up at me with an expression that he didn't know what that meant, and he held out his clean right hand.</p>
<p>"I don’t kill people for no reason."</p>
<p>"Yes, of course you won’t."</p>
<p>Our 'survival contract' was concluded.</p>
<p>And an hour later, little Yoo Joonghyuk spoke.</p>
<p>"I will definitely kill you, Kim Dokja."</p>
