<hr/>
<p>Big house.</p>
<p>The fact that Bicheonhori used that word meant that he already knew that I had come here to meet the 'Second Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p>"I don't know if you remember, but I've met you before."</p>
<p>Bicheonhori looked at me with deep eyes as if he would listen to what I had to say.</p>
<p>"The first time was during the 'Twelve Zodiac Race' at the 'Recycling Center'."</p>
<p>【Hmm. That Bicheonhori you ran with wasn't me.】</p>
<p>"I think it was you who spoke last time, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>I still remembered his last words clearly.</p>
<p>「"Hmm. Is this how it's going to be this time... I hope we get another chance to meet, young man."」</p>
<p>Bicheonhori blinked as if he was somewhat surprised by my answer, then nodded.</p>
<p>【I didn't know you'd remember that time. You're right. That was definitely what I said.】</p>
<p>"We met again after that. On the 'Orient Express carriage' at the 'Recycling Center'."</p>
<p>At that time, I used [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] on Dansu ahjussi and encountered Bicheonhori, who was riding with him.</p>
<p>I also remember clearly what Bicheonhori said to me at that time.</p>
<p>He told me that I would not be able to become a 'Recorder' yet. He also said that I would not be able to write the next chapter of the world because there were too many voices holding me back.</p>
<p>【I have told too many useless things to a friend with a good memory.】</p>
<p>"How did you become a 'Recorder of Fear'? What on earth is the principle of a Recorder of Fear?"</p>
<p>I thought of Lycaon.</p>
<p>Bicheonhori said that he saw the 'end of the world', but as far as I know, Lycaon has never seen the 'end of the world'.</p>
<p>Even so, Lycaon and Bicheonhori both became 'Recorders of Fear'.</p>
<p>"What on earth is your purpose?"</p>
<p>Lycaon said.</p>
<p>'Their job is to collect records of the distorted world lines.'</p>
<p>But that job itself is probably not their goal. There must be some grand purpose behind their collecting records.</p>
<p>【You have a habit of asking too many questions at once.】</p>
<p>"Is this question also a subject of trade?"</p>
<p>【In principle, yes. So, if you pass the interpretation to me, if you pass that, you can ask as many questions as you want—】</p>
<p>"Can't I give you a 'different interpretation'?"</p>
<p>【Different interpretation?】</p>
<p>Bicheonhori, who had been tilting his head for a moment, suddenly threw his head back and started laughing heartily.</p>
<p>【That's an interesting question. There's no way you, who has only recently entered the Fear Realm, would have a 'Special Interpretation'?】</p>
<p>He was right. The other Fears I've interpreted — 'Alien Signal Light' and 'Tooth Fin' are Catastrophe-level or Disaster-level Fears. It would be difficult to attract the attention of the Recorder with Fears of that level. But.</p>
<p>"It's not like 'Fear' is only in the Fear Realm, right?"</p>
<p>【What are you trying to say?】</p>
<p>"I'm talking about the 'Oldest Fear' in this world."</p>
<p>The Oldest Fear in this world.</p>
<p>The origin of this universe that no one has been able to interpret, cannot interpret, and will not be interpreted.</p>
<p>Bicheonhori opened his mouth with a slightly hardened expression.</p>
<p>【Could it be that you're talking about the 'Oldest Dream' right now?】</p>
<p>A light spark flew, but it wasn't filtered. I don't know how powerful a 'Recorder of Fear' Bicheonhori is, but it seems that he can say that name without filtering.</p>
<p>I nodded and answered.</p>
<p>"Yes. I'll tell you about that guy's true identity."</p>
<p>【You're funny. Do you think there's a Recorder of Fear who doesn't know that?】</p>
<p>"His name is Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>【I know. That's the name of the 'symbol' that currently refers to dreams.】</p>
<p>He didn't seem surprised at all. If you're a Recorder of Fear, you know everything up to here.</p>
<p>Then how about this?</p>
<p>"Do you know what food Kim Dokja hates?"</p>
<p>Bicheonhori's expression hardened for the first time at my question.</p>
<p>【Why should I know that?】</p>
<p>"Why should you know? Are you saying that you're not curious about the Oldest Dream right now? Of all people, a 'Recorder of Fear'?"</p>
<p>【No, that's—】</p>
<p>"Are you saying that this interpretation that even the great Morak you revere doesn't know is unnecessary, useless, trivial, and not even worth recording?"</p>
<p>【I never said that! However—】</p>
<p>Bicheonhori hesitated with a very confused expression, then grabbed his pen as if he had decided on something.</p>
<p>【What food does Kim Dokja hate...?】</p>
<p>"Tomatoes."</p>
<p>Bicheonhori opened his eyes wide and began to write something in the air.</p>
<p>【Interesting. Why does he hate tomatoes?】</p>
<p>"From there, it's a trade target. Are you curious?"</p>
<p>It was quite amusing to see Bicheonhori’s dumbfounded expression.</p>
<p>He asked, his lips curled as if he had been hit.</p>
<p>【I see. What was it that you were curious about earlier?】</p>
<p>"How are the Recorders of Fear born?"</p>
<p>【I don’t know exactly how the Recorders of Fear are born. Each Recorder has a different reason.】</p>
<p>Different reasons?</p>
<p>【Some become Recorders after despairing at the end of the world and wanting to leave that despair behind, while others become Recorders to fulfill their unfulfilled wishes in another universe. And some—】</p>
<p>After pausing for a beat, Bicheonhori looked straight into my eyes and continued speaking.</p>
<p>【Some become Recorders after cursing the ending of a universe and wanting to write a new ending.】</p>
<p>"This explanation is too vague."</p>
<p>【But this is all I can say. After all, the 'Recorders' are those chosen by the 'Oldest Dream’.】</p>
<p>Those chosen by the Oldest Dream.</p>
<p>【Becoming a Recorder of Fear means that they hold the possibility of a record that the Oldest Dream can hope for.】</p>
<p>"Is that the answer? I don't even know what you're talking about, and it's not worth trading."</p>
<p>【Huh, you now—】</p>
<p>"So let me ask you one more question. What is your purpose? Why are you collecting interpretations from the Fear Realm and collecting records of the twisted world line?"</p>
<p>【Isn't that a question?】</p>
<p>"Anyway, aren't you going to write something vague and plausible? Tell me quickly."</p>
<p>Bicheonhori now looked as if he was dumbfounded. However, since he was curious about why Kim Dokja hates tomatoes, he had no choice but to answer.</p>
<p>【The reason we collect records of the twisted world line is to write a single 'sentence'.】</p>
<p>"More specifically."</p>
<p>【Do you know what the first thing you have to do to become a good writer is?】</p>
<p>"Well... I guess it's reading a lot, writing a lot, and thinking a lot."</p>
<p>What I said was the basic quality of a good writer.</p>
<p>Reading a lot. Writing a lot. Thinking a lot.</p>
<p>Bicheonhori nodded as if he agreed with those words.</p>
<p>【Before the end of this universe, all 'Recorders of Fear' will be able to write their 'One Sentence' that will remain forever.】</p>
<p>A sentence that will remain forever.</p>
<p>【All Recorders of Fear live their entire lives for that One Sentence from the moment of birth. They collect different interpretations for that sentence and gather records of distorted world lines.】</p>
<p>I suddenly thought that they resembled the Constellations.</p>
<p>Just as the Constellations build up stories and perform scenarios to complete their ■■, the Recorders also repeat the same thing to write the ultimate 'One Sentence'.</p>
<a href="#note1" epub:type="noteref">[NOTE 1]</a><p>"I guess the reason you want my interpretation is for the same reason."</p>
<p>【That's right. I thought I needed to refer to your interpretation to complete my 'One Sentence'.】</p>
<p>"What will happen to you if you can write that 'One Sentence'?"</p>
<p>【That is...】</p>
<p>Bicheonhori smiled brightly and continued.</p>
<p>【I will tell you after hearing your answer. Now, tell me. Why does Kim Dokja hate tomatoes?】</p>
<p>As expected, Yoo Joonghyuk's trickster.</p>
<p>He won't just tell me everything.</p>
<p>【Quickly. Why on earth does he hate tomatoes? Is it because tomatoes remind him of 'blood'?】</p>
<p>I hadn't thought of that.</p>
<p>Bicheonhori smiled and asked, perhaps seeing my expression.</p>
<p>【There must be another reason?】</p>
<p>"It's just because they don't taste good."</p>
<p>Bicheonhori made a blank expression.</p>
<p>【That can't be true.】</p>
<p>"It's true."</p>
<p>【Don't make me laugh. How do you know that? You didn't ask the 'Oldest Dream'.】</p>
<p>"I hate tomatoes too."</p>
<p>【What is that...】</p>
<p>"I'm Kim Dokja too. Did you forget?"</p>
<p>Bicheonhori opened his mouth as if he had been hit again.</p>
<p>I smiled at him and said,</p>
<p>"Then this is the end of the deal. I will see you again next time."</p>
<p>[The turn of the Recorder of Fear 'Fox that Commands the Sky' will soon end.]</p>
<p>As Bicheonhori's appearance slowly began to disperse along with the surrounding scenery, he shouted urgently.</p>
<p>【You can't avoid it with such wordplay forever! In order to go to the 'Big House' you want, you have to clear one of the Faults that our Recorder has...!】</p>
<p>"If there was such a condition, you should have told me about it a long time ago."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Bicheonhori's body was almost gone.</p>
<p>He finished his words with a somewhat hurt expression.</p>
<p>【If possible, it would be better to deal with me. The next 'Recorder' will be a friend much more sinister than me. Think about it carefully...】</p>
<p>With those words, the scenery of Murim completely disappeared.</p>
<p>And when I opened my eyes again.</p>
<p>[Entering the room of the Recorder of Fear 'Demon King of the Cinema'.]</p>
<p>I was sitting in the cinema. A long horizontal line was drawn on the screen that was cast through the darkness. It looked like someone had torn something up and put it together.</p>
<p>A group of small heads were watching the screen.</p>
<p>Since I knew where this was, I didn't panic and watched the screen with the kkoma Kim Dokjas.</p>
<p>「"Cheon Inho, that bad guy."」</p>
<p>The movie shown on the screen was a story I already knew.</p>
<p>The story began when a piece of the stupid Kim Dokja possessed 'Cheon Inho' among the many characters.</p>
<p>【Why did it have to be Cheon Inho? Aren't you curious?】</p>
<p>When I turned my head, there was the Demon King of the Cinema sitting with his legs crossed, gulping down a Zero Carbonated Drink.</p>
<p>【No one would have expected a main character like that.】</p>
<p>Instead of answering, I gulped down the Zero Cola placed next to me. When I didn't respond to the provocation, he raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>
<p>Asmodeus, who was squirming, asked.</p>
<p>【How does it feel to be born as such a protagonist?】</p>
<p>"Are you saying this because I ruined your theater?"</p>
<p>【…】</p>
<p>"You little brat."</p>
<p>I continued to spit at Asmodeus as he furrowed his eyebrows.</p>
<p>"I can see what you're trying to do. You're going to start gaslighting me again by putting up another video like that. What if I'm not the real Kim Dokja? What kind of protagonist do people want?"</p>
<p>【…】</p>
<p>"Do I still look like someone who would ruin their life by being surprised by such words?"</p>
<p>【Oh my. You've grown.】</p>
<p>"I've grown. And I have no intention of dealing with you. I don't know about you, but."</p>
<p>【Then why are you here?】</p>
<p>All the littl Kim Dokjas sitting in the audience were looking this way, perhaps because they were enjoying the sight of us fighting.</p>
<p>I waved my hand lightly at them and said.</p>
<p>"I came to see my readers' faces."</p>
<p>I saw the kkoma Kim Dokja who poked her head out between the movie theater seats. The little girl with the unusually young face had a small name tag attached to her chest that was shaking.</p>
<p>rlaehrwk37.</p>
<p>I know who that 'kkoma Kim Dokja' is.</p>
<p>"How have you been?"</p>
<p>Noh Jiyoon.</p>
<p>The daughter of Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<p>"I'll definitely save you, so don't worry."</p>
<p>As if she understood what I was saying, the kkoma Kim Dokja's eyes quickly became teary.</p>
<p>Asmodeus muttered incredulously.</p>
<p>【When you say that, doesn't it sound like I'm the villain who kidnapped the kids?】</p>
<p>"Isn't that so?"</p>
<p>I glared at the guy for a moment as if we were standing against each other.</p>
<p>【I guess I have to admit that you're at least the main character in terms of guts. But I wonder if you'll be able to keep talking like that after seeing this.】</p>
<p>Asmodeus whistled as he said that. Then, the theater lights turned brightly, and the kkoma Kim Dokjas whose eyes had been shining in the darkness all bowed their heads.</p>
<p>【Let me introduce you to the new Kim Dokja who just joined us.】</p>
<p>At Asmodeus’s signal, the kkoma Kim Dokja sitting next to him stood up with a tap on his small leg.</p>
<p>rlaehrwk244.</p>
<p>A name tag I’ve never seen before. It seemed like he was the Kim Dokja who had been captured by Asmodeus recently.</p>
<p>With snow-white skin and eyes that shone like stars.</p>
<p>Just like all other Kim Dokjas, he had all the characteristics of a Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>However, the kkoma Kim Dokja was holding a book in his hands.</p>
<p>【Do you want to know who it is?】</p>
<p>The moment I saw the title of the book, I got goosebumps.</p>
<p>It was someone I knew.</p>
