<hr/>
<p>"No, wait a minute."</p>
<p>It was unfair. Because it wasn’t me who left Han Sooyoung alone for the 1,863rd Round.</p>
<p>"I’m not an [Avatar]."</p>
<p>"Then what?"</p>
<p>"I—"</p>
<p>I hesitated. I couldn’t think of anything I could say to persuade her.</p>
<p>For a moment, a brief temptation occurred to me.</p>
<p>What if I just used [Incite]? If I used [Incite] to persuade Han Sooyoung to do my bidding.</p>
<p>"I can hear your head spinning."</p>
<p>The moment I heard Han Sooyoung’s laughter, I realized. The opponent in front of me wasn’t someone who could do that.</p>
<p>There was nothing I could do. From here on out, I had no choice but to play fair.</p>
<p>"Just as you’re not the avatar of 'Han Sooyoung in the 3rd Round', I’m not just Kim Dokja’s avatar."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung smiled as if she found it interesting.</p>
<p>"Really? How much of your memories did you inherit?"</p>
<p>"I barely received any memories."</p>
<p>"Yeah. They call someone like you [Avatar]. But isn't that right?"</p>
<p>"Does the amount of memories you have matter? It's not the amount of memories that proves who I am."</p>
<p>"Is that so?"</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung nodded and wrote something in her notebook.</p>
<p>I added while looking at Han Sooyoung like that.</p>
<p>"Just because Han Sooyoung did something wrong in the 3rd Round, you wouldn't blame her for it. It's a bit unfair to blame me for Kim Dokja's mistakes."</p>
<p>"Are you trying to say that you're not that Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I'm not the Kim Dokja you know."</p>
<p>"Then there's no reason for me to help you? Because you're not that Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>Is that really the case? Damn it. I quickly changed my subject.</p>
<p>"But there's something called joint responsibility in this world. Since I'm also using Kim Dokja's name, I think I'm qualified to atone for his mistakes."</p>
<p>Kim Dokja's joint responsibility.</p>
<p>It feels a bit unfair. If there is a responsibility for the Kim Dokja Solidarity, shouldn’t there also be benefits for the Kim Dokja Solidarity? But I’ve never received anything like that.</p>
<p>Of course, I couldn’t complain to Han Sooyoung right in front of me.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung stared at me blankly and chuckled.</p>
<p>"How are you going to atone for this?"</p>
<p>I cleared my throat slightly and began to speak.</p>
<p>"It’s all my fault. I’m sorry for leaving you alone. But I didn’t do it on purpose either."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung’s eyes shook subtly. I didn’t miss that moment and continued to speak.</p>
<p>"I was curious about your story too. I was curious about how you were doing, what you were thinking, and if something big had happened in your world."</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>"I didn’t intentionally avoid visiting. I was just scared."</p>
<p>"Are you scared?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes, when it’s a story you really like, it’s scary to know the ending."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung quietly watched me like that, then glanced at Lee Seolhwa who was peeking at her from behind and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>"If someone saw me, they'd think I was doing this because I wanted an apology."</p>
<p>"You weren't?"</p>
<p>"What would I do accepting something like that?"</p>
<p>"Then why are you upset?"</p>
<p>Was that too direct? Han Sooyoung's expression cracked for a moment.</p>
<p>I didn't miss the opportunity and asked.</p>
<p>"Do you by any chance like Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"If that's not the case, there's no reason for you to be so upset. Weren't you and Kim Dokja just in a business relationship? You gave and took. You broke up cleanly."</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>"Or did you actually want to go back to the 3rd Round with Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung belatedly asked with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>"You're talking about having a pierced mouth, but have you forgotten who's holding the knife?"</p>
<p>"I know. You’re holding on to it. And very tightly. So please spare me."</p>
<p>"Oh my."</p>
<p>"If you spare me, I’ll help you meet Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung paused for a moment and asked back.</p>
<p>"Why do you think I want to meet that kid?"</p>
<p>"If not, I’m sorry, but that kid would really want to see you."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung’s expression once again showed embarrassment.</p>
<p>"If you keep talking nonsense…"</p>
<p>"Han Sooyoung."</p>
<p>Tsk tsk, sparks colored my incarnation body along with the sound. I decided to settle the matter before the aftermath grew any bigger.</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja is in danger. Only you can save him."</p>
<p>Kim Dokja is in danger. I clearly saw the blue that spread across Han Sooyoung’s expression at those words. I was a little envious, and a little sorry.</p>
<p>"Can you take responsibility for that statement?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I can take responsibility."</p>
<p>I knew how cowardly my words were.</p>
<p>Even if I didn’t do anything, she would meet Kim Dokja again. More precisely, the less I did anything, the higher the probability that she would meet Kim Dokja again.</p>
<p>She was destined to become tIs123, and she would definitely meet the young Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be the kind of reunion she wanted.</p>
<p>"How is Kim Dokja in danger?"</p>
<p>"That is…"</p>
<p>"If I save you, you will tell me?"</p>
<p>When I nodded, Han Sooyoung glared at me with a disapproving look and asked.</p>
<p>"I need to know who you made a contract with to come here."</p>
<p>"Will you help me?"</p>
<p>"I will listen to your story."</p>
<p>Fortunately, the atmosphere was not bad. I swallowed a light sigh and said.</p>
<p>"I didn’t make a contract with anyone."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I didn’t make an 'Otherworldly Covenant' to come here."</p>
<p>There is a possibility that an 'Otherworldly Covenant' that I don't know about has been activated.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, I came here through the 'Fear Realm', and the owner of the 'Fear Realm' was the 'King of Fear'.</p>
<p>The 'King of Fear' held numerous Outer Gods, so it would be safe to say that the 'Fear Realm' itself was an 'Otherworldly Covenant'.</p>
<p>However, the 'Fear Realm' has now been destroyed, and the 'King of Fear' has lost his power.</p>
<p>In other words, the 'contract' that sent me here has lost its effect. However, Han Sooyoung's expression upon hearing my words was strange.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute, then you—"</p>
<p>At that moment, thunder rang out from outside the window. Han Sooyoung's eyebrows furrowed and Lee Seolhwa opened the curtains by the window almost at the same time.</p>
<p>"Captain, something is strange!"</p>
<p>Lee Hyunsung's shout from outside. There was a huge portal swirling in the sky outside the window.</p>
<p>I and Han Sooyoung knew what it was.</p>
<p>「Great Hall.」</p>
<p>A passageway to another world was about to open in the vast expanse of sky. A tremendous feast could be felt beyond the hall.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung glared at me with a frown.</p>
<p>"What on earth have you done?"</p>
<p>I looked up at the sky in confusion.</p>
<p>「Even if it was the 1,863rd Round, there’s no way a 'God of Another World' would suddenly descend in the clear sky.」</p>
<p>The scale of probability eventually shifted toward offsetting its weight.</p>
<p>If a God of Another World had appeared, it meant that there was a 'probability' that he would descend in this world line.</p>
<p>My heart sank.</p>
<p>「It’s because of me.」</p>
<p>Up until now, my existence had been protected by a 'scenario'.</p>
<p>[The Management Bureau does not accept your existence.]</p>
<p>However, there was no scenario assigned to me in this worldline. In other words, the current me was an existence that was not needed in the 'scenario'.</p>
<p>Tsutsutsutsut!</p>
<p>The spark that was immediately felt in my incarnation body was the proof.</p>
<p>This worldline does not consider my existence 'probable'. Therefore, in order to protect the probability of this world, my existence must disappear.</p>
<p>【Ooooooooooo.】</p>
<p>Therefore, the guy coming over from the 'Great Hall' right now was a kind of grim reaper that came to erase me from this world.</p>
<p>【IwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantit.】</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung didn't panic and just flicked her fingers in the air.</p>
<p>['True Word Defense System' is activating!]</p>
<p>I felt something like a transparent membrane surrounding the headquarters. Surprisingly, the defense barrier was withstanding the true words of that distant Outer Gazingod.</p>
<p>Kugugugugu.</p>
<p>But as the size of the 'Great Hall' growing in the sky grew, the shaking of the defense barrier also increased.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung glared at me and asked.</p>
<p>"Do you know what you did?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"You're apologizing for bringing something like that? Lee Seolhwa, did you finish measuring its level?"</p>
<p>Lee Seolhwa, who was waiting nearby, shook her head and answered.</p>
<p>"The story measuring device is broken."</p>
<p>"It was fine until the last time you measured the 'Dream Eater', right?"</p>
<p>"It's level is higher than that time."</p>
<p>"Then it's at least 'Old Being' level or higher. What's its true name?"</p>
<p>"I didn't figure it out."</p>
<p>"Hmm."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung's expression became very serious.</p>
<p>"The Final Scenario is right around the corner, and because of this kid, the Earth could be destroyed."</p>
<p>I nodded calmly and said.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry. So please help me, Han Sooyoung."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung grumbled as if she was dumbfounded by my words.</p>
<p>"This is really shameless."</p>
<p>"You don't have a choice anyway. If you don't help me, your worldline will be destroyed."</p>
<p>"What do you want me to help you with?"</p>
<p>"Please help me return to the 41st Round."</p>
<p>As I said before, there are several conditions needed to 'move worldlines' in this world. However, I wasn't Yoo Joonghyuk, and I didn't have an 'ark' to cross worldlines like the Constellations.</p>
<p>So now, the only thing left for me is the last method.</p>
<p>"I will make an Otherworldly Covenant."</p>
<p>"Will that work now?"</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"With that kind of thing targeting you right now, do you think there would be an Outer God that wants to make an 'Otherwordly Covenant' with you?"</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung was right.</p>
<p>The otherworldly deity that is making an 'Otherworldly Covenant' right now will definitely clash with the Outer God targeting me from beyond the 'Great Hall'.</p>
<p>In other words, only a being stronger than the 'Outer God' targeting me would accept my offer.</p>
<p>"If the guy over there is stronger than the 'Old Being', then there is a possibility that he is at the level of the 'Great Old Being'."</p>
<p>Great Old Being.</p>
<p>I kept my mouth shut at that expression that I had finally heard. Han Sooyoung added, how she had taken my silence unknown.</p>
<p>"If the guy over there is at the 'Great Old Being' level, then there will be no Outer God that will help you."</p>
<p>I knew it too.</p>
<p>The Outer God that reaches the 'Great Old Being' level is a kind of 'Mythical Constellation' among the Outer Gods.</p>
<p>Still, I shook my head.</p>
<p>"No, it's not like there's no one."</p>
<p>Even if the being that covets me from beyond is a 'Great Old Being', it's not like there's no Outer God that can stand against it.</p>
<p>"You, really."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung's expression as she looked at me was strangely hardened. Perhaps she had realized it too.</p>
<p>"The being that brought you to this 'worldline'."</p>
<p>The only being that can stand against a 'Great Old Being' is a 'Great Old Being'.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and opened my mouth.</p>
<p>"Han Sooyoung, please call 'Secretive Plotter'."</p>
