<hr/>
<p>Why is Shin Yoosoung in this dungeon now?</p>
<p>I put my rising doubts behind and moved my body as if sliding to enter the Nagak where Shin Yoosoung was hiding.</p>
<p>Doo doo doo!</p>
<p>A sound like a rapid drumming rang out, and I felt the air pressure in my ears change. But other than that, there were no other hits. This shell prevented the ensemble attack of 'Ancient Nagak'.</p>
<p>"You won't get attacked if you're inside. I'm not sure why..."</p>
<p>It was a way I hadn't thought of.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, the Nagaks here would also listen to each other's ensemble, but they weren't hurting each other.</p>
<p>We held our breath as we lay on our stomachs inside the narrow shell. When the sound had quieted down a bit, I lifted the shell slightly and explored the surroundings.</p>
<p>In the distance, an Ancient Nagak could be seen pacing the terrarium.</p>
<p>Apparently, they hadn't found us yet.</p>
<p>"I feel safe now."</p>
<p>When the faint light came through the cracks in the shell, the face of Shin Yoosoung, whom I had seen before, came into my eyes once again.</p>
<p>「It was a magical moment.」</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung stuttered in embarrassment at my gaze.</p>
<p>"Well, he was originally a child who had almost reached the end of his lifespan. By chance, he communicated with me, and he said he wanted to give me a house of his own..."</p>
<p>It was only belatedly that I realized that Shin Yoosoung was talking about this shell.</p>
<p>There must have been a hermit crab in here too.</p>
<p>However, the guy seemed to have passed on this shell to Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p>It was something that could have happened to Shin Yoosoung, not to anyone else.</p>
<p>Because she is an incarnation that can communicate with monsters.</p>

</fieldset>
<p>I recalled the contents of the main story while reading and compared the abilities of Shin Yoosoung in front of me with the main story.</p>
<p>I don't know what the difference is, but some skills and overall stat levels were a little different from what I knew.</p>
<p>The question I had been thinking of for a while popped into my mind once again.</p>
<p>Why is Shin Yoosoung here?</p>
<p>According to my memory, Shin Yoosoung became a wanderer for a long time, and it was after the 'fourth scenario' that she met Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>I sincerely bowed my head.</p>
<p>"Thank you for saving me."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes..... no!"</p>
<p>In any case, if it weren't for this child, I would have fallen prey to the 'Ancient Nagak' without moving here.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' admires the actions of this incarnation.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is moved by the good deeds of incarnation 'Shin Yoosoung'.]</p>
<p>A message from the constellations flying in the air.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' sponsors 100 coins to incarnation 'Shin Yoosoung'.]</p>
<p>"Ah. Ah..."</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, who received a sponsorship, looked back at me with a confused expression. I nodded my head as a sign to accept it quickly. Shin Yoosoung, blushing, bowed her head to the air.</p>
<p>"Thank you. Thank you."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is impressed by the incarnation.]</p>
<p>[An anonymous constellation says that these are all tricks to extract coins.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' laments that the constellations have lost their innocence these days.]</p>
<p>I felt strange.</p>
<p>Was this Shin Yoosoung before meeting Kim Dokja?</p>
<p>I opened my mouth in a low voice so as not to be noticed by other monsters.</p>
<p>"I'm late to introduce myself. My name is Cheon Inho."</p>
<p>"I'm... Shin Yoosoung."</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung said that and added hesitantly.</p>
<p>"You're an adult, so you can talk comfortably."</p>
<p>"No. You are my benefactor."</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung opened her eyes wide and rolled only her pupils.</p>
<p>"But I feel like I’m doing something wrong because I’m being treated with respect by an adult…"</p>
<p>Apparently, Shin Yoosoung felt uncomfortable hearing respectful words from adults.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a moment, I replied:</p>
<p>"You don't know what type of person I am yet."</p>
<p>"A little... I know."</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung wriggled her hands for a moment as if she was embarrassed, then pointed to my coat pocket and said,</p>
<p>"You took care of the belongings of the dead."</p>
<p>When did you come to that conclusion?</p>
<p>In fact, I took the belongings of the dead incarnations while hunting Nagaks.</p>
<p>It was to check if there were any incarnations I knew, including Dansu ahjussi, and to inform the people of the Chungmuro group if there were any faces they knew.</p>
<p>"You're going outside to let others know... right?"</p>
<p>Those who entered the one-man dungeon, 'Nagak's Field', were more likely to be in a relatively isolated position in the group.</p>
<p>If there was a party, of course they would have entered a 3-person, 5-person, or 7-person dungeon.</p>
<p>Choosing one person must mean that there was a reason why they had no choice but to come in alone.</p>
<p>"I just packed the items. Why did you come in alone, Yoosoung-ssi?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I am..."</p>
<p>When our eyes met, Shin Yoosoung hurriedly lowered her head and stammered.</p>
<p>"Because grown-ups don’t like teaming up with me…"</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>In a word, everything made sense.</p>
<p>The reason Shin Yoosoung was here alone, and the reason why she was hiding and observing my actions...</p>
<p>"They are bad adults."</p>
<p>"Ah, no. But he said that if I clear this place and get a 'commentary notice', he will go with me. He said he would accept me into the group."</p>
<p>Did they even ask a child who hadn't even joined the group to do that?</p>
<p>"They are really bad adults."</p>
<p>"Oh, oh, not really. It's a natural choice for them."</p>
<p>"A natural choice?"</p>
<p>"Someone said that adults and children are equal in this world. Now, children are not children… But things like me aren’t very helpful… Rather, giving me an opportunity like this… I should be thankful..."</p>
<p>I was extremely confused.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire’ lights a double wick in her eyes.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' laments that the virtues of the Korean Peninsula have fallen to the ground.]</p>
<p>As Kim Dokja once said, in an apocalyptic world, there was not much difference between children and adults.</p>
<p>Children can also become stronger by raising their abilities with coins.</p>
<p>Therefore, Shin Yoosoung, a child, could say things like that as if she understood the circumstances of the adults.</p>
<p>But is it really okay?</p>
<p>Just because a new world has begun, is it okay to suddenly leave such a burden on the children?</p>
<p>Is it okay to treat children and adults as completely equal just because they have the same physical abilities?</p>
<p>"Which group of people said that?"</p>
<p>Children in this world are scary.</p>
<p>Like the children of the Beggar Sect, there are even children who specialize in hunting adults.</p>
<p>So, while asking that question, I didn't miss the possibility that it was Shin Yoosoung’s acting.</p>
<p>Even when she actually met Kim Dokja, Shin Yoosoung was a child who could use the sympathy of adults.</p>
<p>But if all this was this little kid's design, it was fine as it was.</p>
<p>Knowing a child's desires but turning a blind eye to them.</p>
<p>Because that might be the only gift you can give a child as an adult living in this crazy world.</p>
<p>"That... I can't remember their name... It's a group that belongs to a place called the Union."</p>
<p>Union.</p>
<p>It was a name I had heard from Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p>Did you say it was a group of kings, including the tyrant king?</p>
<p>"Let's escape from here together."</p>
<p>We have to somehow get Shin Yoosoung out of here.</p>
<p>And, unlike the main story, I must see the faces of the proud adults who drove the child to death with my own eyes.</p>
<p>[You have hunted 504 Nagaks.]</p>
<p>[Dungeon escape will be possible after 1 minute.]</p>
<p>The time to escape was drawing near.</p>
<p>I had finished hunting 500 Nagaks, which was my target, so all I had to do was wait. However, Shin Yoosoung muttered weakly.</p>
<p>"I can't go. I haven't met my quota yet."</p>
<p>Well, it's a dungeon that even adults couldn't clear. Even if she was talented, there was no way Shin Yoosoung, who was only a child, couldn’t clear it alone.</p>
<p>"I'll help you."</p>
<p>If you hunt only 100 Nagaks, you can meet the escape condition of the 'Nagak’s Field'.</p>
<p>The problem is that the Ancient Nagak is looking for us from afar.</p>
<p>But while I'm wasting my time, if Shin Yoosoung just hunts Nagaks one by one-</p>
<p>[The character 'Shin Yoosoung' feels extreme mental pain.]</p>
<p>Watching Shin Yoosoung tremble with her arms wrapped around her, I realized that I was one step closer to the Shin Yoosoung Kim Dokja met.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I can't."</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung's first scenario flashed through my mind.</p>
<p>She is a child who had to survive by killing her dog.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung's trauma was still vivid.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. You can go alone. I can stay here, so-"</p>
<p>I thought it didn't matter whether it was acting or not.</p>
<p>If that's acting.</p>
<p>[Some constellations are curious about your next choice.]</p>
<p>That's what's wrong is this world that made Shin Yoosoung act like that.</p>
<p>"I'll die if I'm here alone."</p>
<p>"You don't want to die. You don't have to say that."</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung still hung her head.</p>
<p>"The school teaches you what to do in dangerous situations."</p>
<p>However, not everyone can do what they are taught at school.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that you should be considerate of the elderly and that you shouldn't hurt people.</p>
<p>I know that when I need help, I have to tell someone to help me.</p>
<p>But some people can't tell even if they know it.</p>
<p>There are people who have become like that.</p>
<p>"Shin Yoosoung helped  me even though I didn't ask for help. So, I will help you too."</p>
<p>It's not because I'm an adult. It's not because Shin Yoosoung is a child.</p>
<p>I’m just helping, because she's the one I can help right now.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, still unable to meet my eyes, opened her mouth.</p>
<p>"But I don't have the confidence to kill the monsters..."</p>
<p>"Killing is not the only answer."</p>
<p>I checked the number of monsters scattered throughout the terrarium.</p>
<p>Is it because I slaughtered quite a few of them?</p>
<p>Now, there were not that many living monsters in this 'Field of Nagak'.</p>
<p>There is no sign that Nagak's numbers are increasing.</p>
<p>If so, there is one way to try it out.</p>
<p>"You don't have to kill them. Instead, it can be a little painful."</p>
<p>However, in order to use this method, Shin Yoosoung’s help was needed.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's harder than killing. It's hard on the body, not the mind."</p>
<p>"If that's the case."</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung raised her head and looked up at me.</p>
<p>"I'd like to. If I don't have to kill anything."</p>
<p>She is a determined child.</p>
<p>I nodded and said.</p>
<p>"Then let's try it."</p>
<p>"By the way, are you okay? If you're in trouble because of me—"</p>
<p>"No problem. And don't worry too much."</p>
<p>I smiled lightly as if to calm a frightened child.</p>
<p>"No matter what happens, I will protect you."</p>
<p>I briefly explained the operation.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, who has a good brain, understood my words right away.</p>
<p>"Can I really do that?"</p>
<p>"It will be."</p>
<p>This operation relied entirely on Shin Yoosoung's talent.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung must believe in me to make this method possible.</p>
<p>"Start."</p>
<p>I flipped the cudgel cover and started running.</p>
<p>I must have walked dozens of steps after stepping on a puddle, and the monsters around me, noticing my presence, all looked at me in unison.</p>
<p>[Nagak ensemble begins.]</p>
<p>The sound waves inadvertently pouring behind my steps.</p>
<p>I gave a signal to Shin Yoosoung, who was looking at me from a distance, while running.</p>
<p>[The character, 'Shin Yoosoung' activates 'Tame Lv.5'!]</p>
<p>[The character 'Shin Yoosoung' activates 'Multispecies Sympathy Lv.6'!]</p>
<p>The purpose of this operation was simple.</p>
<p>While I was attracting the attention of the Nagaks, Shin Yoosoung, who activated [Tame], tamed the Nagaks in the terrarium.</p>
<p>This operation was conceived from Shin Yoosoung's status window.</p>
<p>[The character 'Shin Yoosoung' is currently hunting 1 Nagak.]</p>
<p>Clearly, Shin Yoosoung was in a state where she couldn't kill even a single Nagak. Nevertheless, Shin Yoosoung already has a record of killing a Nagak. From this record, I can infer two hypotheses.</p>
<p>One, Shin Yoosoung can actually kill Nagaks.</p>
<p>Two, simply 'taming' them is recognized as hunting.</p>
<p>Whichever hypothesis is correct, the operation was well worth a try.</p>
<p>Even if this operation fails-</p>
<p>「"I will send Shin Yoosoung. It's an opportunity to increase her monster army."」</p>
<p>At the very least, Shin Yoosoung will be able to secure monsters to protect herself from adults.</p>
<p>[Character 'Shin Yoosoung' failed to 'tame'!]</p>
<p>The problem is that 'Shin Yuseung''s skill proficiency is too low.</p>
<p>From a distance, I could see Shin Yoosoung's face stained with faint despair.</p>
<p>"Oh, Ahjussi—"</p>
<p>I cried out in a loud voice.</p>
<p>"Calm down, try again one by one! You can do it!"</p>
<p>In fact, it was difficult for Shin Yoosoung at this point.</p>
<p>Even in the main story, Shin Yoosoung tamed sea creatures of 7th or higher after growing up under the special training of Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, there was no Kim Dokja in this world.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.9' is activated!]</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung now has me.</p>
