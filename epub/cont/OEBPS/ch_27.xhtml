<hr/>
<p>[4,000 coins have been invested into 'Strength'.]</p>
<p>[Strength Lv.10 → Strength Lv.20]</p>
<p>[Your strength level have increased significantly!]</p>
<p>[Passing goblins will be scared away by your strength.]</p>
<p>First of all, my strength should be high.</p>
<p>[5,800 coins have been invested into 'Agility'.]</p>
<p>[Agility Lv.4 → Agility Lv.20]</p>
<p>[Your agility level have increased significantly!]</p>
<p>[Your agility will make even a passing elf look back.]</p>
<p>I have two left feet, so I'll use my high agility to dodge.</p>
<p>[3,800 coins have been invested into 'Physique'.]</p>
<p>[Physique Lv.4 → Physique Lv.15]</p>
<p>I need this much physique.</p>
<p>[1,800 coins have been invested into 'Magic Power'.]</p>
<p>[Magic Power Lv.4 → Magic Power Lv.10]</p>
<p>Luckily, Magic Power had a birth stat of 4, so I could save some coins.</p>
<p>[A total of 15,400 coins have been spent.]</p>
<p>[Coins Possessed: 1,700 C]</p>
<p>I was down to my last coin, but I had no regrets. You need to increase your stats early on.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I met Yoo Joonghyuk that I realized this.</p>
<p>I don't have any S-class skills, so when I meet a monster like Yoo Joonghyuk, I have to support my body to withstand even one blow.</p>
<p>[You are the third incarnation of this scenario to break through Strength level 20.]</p>
<p>[300 coins have been acquired as a reward.]</p>
<p>[You are the third incarnation of this scenario to break through Agility level 20.]</p>
<p>[300 coins have been acquired as a reward.]</p>
<p>Despite hitting Strength and Agility level 20 so quickly, there was someone faster than me.</p>
<p>Probably other readers. What a great bunch of guys.</p>
<p>Grrrrr.</p>
<p>Soon, I began to hear the cries of the ground rats. We had finally entered a densely populated area.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi, who were beside me, started to move nervously.</p>
<p>"You two together!"</p>
<p>As if the two of them had just planned a formation, the tanker Kyung Sein stepped forward, and Dansoo ahjussi followed behind her, sloppily drawing his sword.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein looked at me with a serious expression and asked.</p>
<p>"There's also the 'three together' formation!"</p>
<p>"That...... you two look good together."</p>
<p>"In front! There are seven!"</p>
<p>Kyung Sein let out a roaring shout and ran forward, only to be gnawed to pieces.</p>
<p>A weak body would be split into two in an instant.</p>
<p>"Uaaak! It hurts! It hurts! help me!"</p>
<p>I wonder how much physique does she have. Despite being bitten here and there by the ground rats, Kyung Sein was unharmed.</p>
<p>Then Dansoo ahjussi began do some strange movements.</p>
<p>"Hang in there, hee-job!"</p>
<p>Judging by the flashy movements, it was clear that if I left them to their own devices, they wouldn't catch a single ground rat.</p>
<p>I pulled out the thorns I'd bought and lightly poked the nearest ground rat.</p>
<p>Its head exploded like a ripe tomato.</p>
<p>Indeed, Strength level 20 was something else. I started stabbing their heads one by one.</p>
<p>Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!</p>
<p>In no time at all, I had cleared out five of them, and when I turned around, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi had barely cleared out one each.</p>
<p>When Kyung Sein realized that there were no more ground rats around us, she looked at me in disbelief and asked.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi, were you actually strong?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"I knew it, I knew it!"</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' points his finger, saying you're too proud of yourself for a power you gained from coins.]</p>
<p>I'm so excited because it's the first time I've used it.</p>
<p>After that, we encountered mischiefs of ground rats a few times, but with my strength and agility exceeding 20, the ground rats were no longer an opponent for me.</p>
<p>"Wow, Inho-ssi, you're awesome."</p>
<p>"Heh, I feel strong."</p>
<p>This is how the protagonist feels.</p>
<p>As we were advancing, beating ground rats one by one, I couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' says this is the only time you can play like this.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' says that the early stages of growth are the most fun.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' agrees that it is.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' blinks nostalgically.]</p>
<p>Missing it.......</p>
<p>Well, I'm sure the other constellations grew up catching ground rats at first.</p>
<p>That thought reminded me of Kim Dokja again.</p>
<p>"Suddenly, I really respect Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>He must have crossed the same Yaksu Station tunnel as us.</p>
<p>At a much lower level than me.</p>
<p>He wasn't afraid, he didn't back down, and he believed in what he read.</p>
<p>Can I believe in what I write?</p>
<p>Kyung Sein asked.</p>
<p>"There will be no Kim Dokja in this world line, right?"</p>
<p>"Because this is 'Ways of Survival'."</p>
<p>As I answered, a memory flashed through my mind.</p>
<p>I remembered the Kim Dokja in my dream. One of which was really vague, and one of which was just a kkoma.......</p>
<p>Is there really no Kim Dokja in this world?</p>
<p>"But maybe he's looking at us from up there, just like we did."</p>
<p>The ceiling of the dark tunnel was as dark as a starless night sky.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein looked up for a moment, then suddenly waved her hand and called out.</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja! Kim Dokja!"</p>
<p>She shouted it several times.</p>
<p>Naturally, there was no answer from thin air, but Kyung Sein seemed much happier.</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja......."</p>
<p>If Kim Dokja is really seeing this world, our positions are now reversed.</p>
<p>I wondered if I could reach the end of the scenarios like him.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure. But there's Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p>There will be other readers.</p>
<p>It's hard for one person, but if we all work together, it might be possible.</p>
<p>If it's as Han Sooyoung said, they're also 'Kim Dokja's fragments'.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' nods.]</p>
<p>I wonder what form this 'filtering' takes for the constellations.</p>
<p>It was then that something like starlight flickered across the darkness.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>I rushed over to it and saw a flashlight on the floor. Someone had been here before.</p>
<p>And beside it.</p>
<p>"Over here."</p>
<p>We looked down into pitch black cave, which opened up beneath our feet.</p>
<p>"I think I found it."</p>
<p>It was the 'Edge of Darkness'.</p>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
<p>We stepped into the darkness, hand in hand.</p>
<p>It was definitely a passage leading down, but the moment we entered it, gravity magically shifted toward the wall.</p>
<p>It was as described in the Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>In this space filled with black ether, light loses its meaning. In the darkness, you can't see a thing, and you have to rely on your senses to move forward.</p>
<p>Leading the way was Dansoo ahjussi, who had [Diverse Communication].</p>
<p>"This way."</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi sounded encouraged, as if he finally realized he had an important role to play.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein spoke up as if bored.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"How old are you?"</p>
<p>"I'll be 53 this year."</p>
<p>"You mean your original age?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You can talk to us comfortably¹. Right, Inho-ssi?"</p>
<a href="#note1" epub:type="noteref">[NOTE 1]</a><p>"Yes. Make yourself comfortable."</p>
<p>I could feel him shaking his head in the darkness.</p>
<p>"I'm comfortable with honorifics."</p>
<p>I don't think that's respectful of us to do.</p>
<p>Anyway, he was a very polite man.</p>
<p>"May I ask what you used to do for work?"</p>
<p>He seemed to think about my question for a moment.</p>
<p>"Before I came here, I was just unemployed."</p>
<p>I wondered if I shouldn't have asked, but he continued immediately.</p>
<p>"I was in the hospital."</p>
<p>Hospital. The moment he said the word, his hand in mine became strangely strong.</p>
<p>"Maybe that's why this world feels more like an opportunity to me."</p>
<p>Opportunity.</p>
<p>I knew what he meant, but I thought it would be rude to ask more.</p>
<p>This time, ahjussi asked.</p>
<p>"Why do you think we're here?"</p>
<p>It was the first question that anyone who came to this world would ask themselves.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein was the first to answer.</p>
<p>"Maybe we're here to experience it, too."</p>
<p>His tone was playful, but it was also a possibility that couldn't be ruled out.</p>
<p>"What do you think, Inho-ssi?"</p>
<p>I thought for a moment before answering.</p>
<p>"Maybe they need someone to complete this story."</p>
<p>"Oh...... I hadn't thought of something that profound. So, was it 'Ways of Survival' that summoned us?"</p>
<p>"I don't know about that."</p>
<p>"Maybe it was &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt;. Kim Dokja? Yoo Joonghyuk?"</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk, ahjussi."</p>
<p>I wonder who called us here.</p>
<p>I thought it was &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt; at first, but now I'm not sure.</p>
<p>I wonder if &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt; would bring their readers to this dangerous place for any reason.</p>
<p>"Could it be Han Sooyoung? She's Omniscient Reader's writer after all."</p>
<p>The moment I heard Kyung Sein's words, I felt a strange feeling.</p>
<p>As expected, readers also think that Han Sooyoung is the 'writer' of this world.</p>
<p>Even I felt a little miserable that I didn't have any objection to that fact.</p>
<p>When I think about it, 'Omniscient Reader' was quite an unusual novel.</p>
<p>Originally, I had never thought of such a story before. But the story came to me one day out of the blue.</p>
<p>It was as if someone had hit me in the back of the head.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein continued.</p>
<p>"Of course, our world line's former Omniscient Reader's writer is a different person......."</p>
<p>My palms suddenly felt sweaty. I was glad it was pitch black.</p>
<p>"I don't know what happened to our writer. Maybe he got possessed along with us, or maybe he's already dead because he's always writing announcements saying that he's sick. I even sent him a note on how to stretch the other day."</p>
<p>He's holding your hand right now.</p>
<p>"Shh. There's someone in front of us."</p>
<p>We shut up at ahjussi's words.</p>
<p>The black ether around us visibly decreased, and we gradually began to see a little further ahead.</p>
<p>It meant we were approaching the 'Dark Root', the core of the 'Edge of Darkness'.</p>
<p>"Someone's fighting."</p>
<p>We heard the faint sound of a weapon.</p>
<p>[You have entered the 'Ground Rat's Treasure Trove'.]</p>
<p>[Someone is performing a sub scenario.]</p>
<p>The bodies of a number of ground rats littered the floor. They were cut from head to stomach with a single sword, so it's clear that this person was very good.</p>
<p>As I got closer, I saw a dark fire(暗火) burning in the darkness. A somber box under the light of the dark fire.</p>
<p>It was the 'random item box' we were looking for.</p>
<p>Standing in front of it was, as expected, the Dark Keeper.</p>
<p>The battle was already well underway, and the enraged Dark Keeper was casting tentacle patterns in a frenzy.</p>
<p>"Kallituu!"</p>
<p>There was a short person fighting the Dark Keeper.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein whispered.</p>
<p>"That's the one I saw earlier, on the bike."</p>
<p>A woman with a light blue bob and sunglasses was engaged in a breathtaking battle.</p>
<p>She was dodging the tentacles with uncanny fluidity, delivering blow after blow. It was as if she'd typed in her fighting commands and then executed them.</p>
<p>Even more shocking was the blue-white ether that flowed faintly from her steel fist.</p>
<p>Dedicated Sword Force (罡氣功).</p>
<p>It sounded familiar.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein muttered under her breath.</p>
<p>"That's it, right?"</p>
<p>"I think so."</p>
<p>I looked again, sure enough.</p>
<p>She was using Kim Dokja's [Purest Sword Force].</p>
<p>I wondered who the hell had robbed that item, but it must have been her.</p>
<p>The Purest Sword Force is the Purest Sword Force, but I was surprised that she could fight like that against the Dark Watcher.</p>
<p>What on earth did she do to be able to grow so rapidly from the beginning?</p>
<p>I wondered who she was.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Character List' is activated!]</p>
<p>[The information of this person can't be read in 'Character List'.]</p>
<p>[This person is a 'character' but not a 'character'.]</p>
<p>That woman is definitely a 'reader'.</p>
<p>Maybe she's one of the 'pros' Kyung Sein mentioned.</p>

<p>I was dazed for a moment.</p>
<p>0 complete reads.</p>
<p>That means she's never read Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>And yet she can fight like that?</p>
<p>[The reader has no record of having read 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint'.]</p>
<p>[Additional information about the target has been updated.]</p>
<p>[Some of the 'List Information' is corrected.]</p>
<p>When I checked again, some of the information had changed.</p>

<p>Number of Reads: 0 times (12.8 times)</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Suddenly, I saw 12.8 times in parentheses. What the hell?</p>
<p>It was at that moment that I felt a cold sensation in the back of my head.</p>
<p>Something pointy touched the back of my neck.</p>
<p>"All three of you, don't move. If any of you move, I'll kill him."</p>
<p>I felt goosebumps. I didn't notice him at all.</p>
<p>"Drop your weapons to the ground and slowly put your hands over your heads."</p>
<p>Since I didn't know my opponent's strength level or skill information, it was best to do as I was told.</p>
<p>If he was good enough at stealth to get behind us now, he could attack us at any moment.</p>
<p>Spot!</p>
<p>That's when the tide turned in the melee up ahead. The woman who had been dodging the tentacles with her ghostly movements received a cut on her forearm for the first time.</p>
<p>I opened my mouth.</p>
<p>"We can help. We're not here to be enemies."</p>
<p>"We don't need help."</p>
<p>"Don't be greedy. You know you can't catch it on your own."</p>
<p>"We two are enough."</p>
<p>The man spoke to the woman in a calm voice.</p>
<p>"Yerin, don't panic, fight. The pattern is starting again."</p>
<p>The man's following words surprised me.</p>
<p>"The pattern starts at the upper right. After that, there will be one at the bottom, and then you'll have to feed him a series of consecutive strikes."</p>
<p>This was clearly how Kim Dokja had beaten the 'Dark Keeper' in 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<p>He remembered it all?</p>
<p>"Cut off all the tentacles. Then finish it."</p>
<p>Blue-white ether surged from the woman's fist. It was meant to gather energy and end it in a single blow.</p>
<p>But it was a clear mistake.</p>
<p>I didn't write about it in detail in Omniscient Reader, but the Dark Keeper had one final hidden pattern.</p>
<p>The last pattern that Ji Eunyoo edited out because she thought the battle scene was getting too long.</p>
<p>I sucked in a breath and shouted at the top of my lungs.</p>
<p>"Dodge! There's one more! Last one is from the floor!"</p>
<p>As soon as I finished speaking, a tentacle shot out from the floor.</p>
<p>She froze for a moment, but managed to dodge the tentacle before delivering the final blow.</p>
<p>Kuaaaaaah!</p>
<p>The now incapacitated Dark Keeper fell to his knees and slumped to the ground.</p>
<p>The woman who had just spotted us looked over. I couldn't see her eyes through her sunglasses, but I could tell she was surprised.</p>
<p>A man's voice came from behind me.</p>
<p>"Turn around slowly."</p>
<p>We slowly turned around with our hands on our heads.</p>
<p>As soon as we turned around, we saw the man holding the 'Stone Hog's Pointed Thorn'.</p>
<p>He was obviously an extra because he didn't look familiar, but I was impressed that he had a pretty handsome face.</p>
<p>To put it in Ways of Survival terms, it was enough to maybe poke Yoo Joonghyuk's face with a finger. I immediately activated my skill.</p>
