<hr/>
<p>[The Constellation, 'Ender of War', expresses strong hostility toward you.]</p>
<p>According to folklore, Vidar, the 'Ender of War', was a Constellation that played a crucial role in Ragnarok.</p>
<p>He was the son of Odin, the 'One-Eyed Father', and a central Constellation in Asgard.</p>
<p>Because of this, he must have been quite offended by my mention of the 'World Tree'.</p>
<p>"Now I understand the situation."</p>
<p>I smiled and slowly turned to them.</p>
<p>"So you plan to use me as fertilizer for this 'tree'."</p>
<p>There are several ways for a Constellation of folklore to leap to mythical status.</p>
<p>One is to steadily build up a series of stories, large and small, reaching the realm of myth through a gradual rise to mythic status.</p>
<p>However, this method takes a long time, and there's no guarantee of reaching mythical status. That's why some Constellations prefer the traditional method.</p>
<p>It was to trigger a 'Giant Tale Scenario' and become the ruler of destruction and creation.</p>
<p>For example, &lt;Hongik&gt; nurtured the Divine Dansoo, and &lt;Asgard&gt; nurtured the World Tree Yggdrasil.</p>
<p>「These guys intend to use the tree of the 'Breaking the Sky Sword Saint' as the foundation of a new world.」</p>
<p>"It would be more beneficial for you, the ones who realize the 'Giant Tale' through me, than to consume me immediately."</p>
<p>Even by taking my fragments, you could elevate your original status.</p>
<p>However, fundamentally, only the 'Oldest Dream' can properly process the 'Kim Dokja Fragments'. Therefore, even if you consume me, they won't be able to properly digest the stories of the 'Oldest Dream'.</p>
<p>Therefore, they plan to process me into a 'story' they can digest.</p>
<p>"Didn't my brother promise you again? If you ascend with this tree, he'll recognize you as a Myth-grade Constellation in the new world?"</p>
<p>[That's not something you need to know—]</p>
<p>"Do Odin and Zeus know about what you're doing?"</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>"They don't seem to know."</p>
<p>If a lower scenario was so big that it grew the seeds of the 'World Tree', and the higher scenarios didn't notice, then I had to assume a cataclysmic event was unfolding there.</p>
<p>I don't know, but it probably means there's a major conflict between Giant Nebulae, or a clash between Myth-grade Constellations.</p>
<p>[I don't need to hear any more. Deal with it.]</p>
<p>With a loud explosion, over a dozen Constellations simultaneously unleashed their attacks at me. These attacks ranged from the late Historical-grade to the mid Narrative-grade.</p>
<p>In the past, they would have been quite intimidating.</p>
<p>"You seem to be mistaken—"</p>
<p>I blinked slowly, and I felt the story within my body spinning furiously.</p>
<p>[I haven't been idle for eight years.]</p>
<p>With this mantra, the story within me began to speak.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>[The story, 'Demon King of Salvation', begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>Pitch-black wings protruded from the wingtips, deflecting all the attacks from the incoming Constellations. A blue-white lightning flashed from the red horns atop my head, and with a twitching sensation in my right arm, the story of the Demon King of Salvation manifested.</p>
<p>[The story fragment, 'Sword Master's Right Arm Stung by His Colleague', begins its storytelling again.]</p>
<p>On the day the Star Ladder descended, the Demon King of Salvation used one of his story blades to its fullest potential, slicing down the Constellations.</p>
<p>I could now emulate that monstrous story interpretation skill of that day.</p>
<p>「I am Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>The [Incite] I had been harboring within me manifested, and a surge of Baekcheong-ganggi instantly decapitated several nearby Constellations.</p>
<p>Apollo and Vidar widened their eyes in shock as they watched the late Historical-grade and early Narrative-grade Constellations fall with a single blow.</p>
<p>[You've reached the late Narrative-grade?]</p>
<p>I grinned and retorted.</p>
<p>[Why, why shouldn't we?]</p>
<p>As the confidently charging Constellations suddenly lost their momentum, Apollo, finally regaining his composure, uttered a warning.</p>
<p>[Just because he's late Narrative-grade doesn't change anything. He's alone. Keep your distance and gradually weaken his power.]</p>
<p>At Apollo's command, the Constellations reorganized their battle lines. Small bows appeared in the hands of the Constellations that had escaped the range of [Baekcheong-ganggi].</p>
<p>「The Standard Artemis Bow.」</p>
<p>I also knew this item. It was mass-produced by Olympus in Hephaestus' workshop in preparation for the 'Gigantomachia'.</p>
<p>Although it was a replica of a sacred relic, it was crafted from amethyst metal, so its power rivaled that of a sacred relic belonging to a Constellation of considerable power.</p>
<p>[Shoot.]</p>
<p>I activated [Way of the Wind] and dodged the incoming arrows. Those I couldn't dodge, I deflected them with amethyst. Each shot put a heavy strain on my right arm, but I could still withstand it.</p>
<p>「That flame is the driving force behind the sun chariot.」</p>
<p>Apollo, who had been observing the situation, seemed to have decided this couldn't go on, and was the first to intervene. As Apollo's amethyst began to speak, the artificial sun radiating light behind him erupted in flames.</p>
<p>I deliberately avoided the creature's flames by focusing on the tree, the very essence of the 'Impossible Justice'. In an instant, the air around the area boiled and the forest began to scream.</p>
<p>Vidar, unable to bear it any longer, shouted,</p>
<p>[Apollo, stop! Are you planning to burn down the entire World Tree?]</p>
<p>Their goal was to use me as fertilizer for this tree. As long as this limitation existed, even at a slight disadvantage in terms of combat power, I had a chance of victory.</p>
<p>And contrary to their claims, I wasn't alone.</p>
<p>"Heewon-ssi!"</p>
<p>With a clap of thunder, the head of a Constellation that had been firing arrows was severed.</p>
<p>[Kwaaaaak!]</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, with her 'Mad Butcher' trait in full effect, was rampaging through the Constellations.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Disciple of Breaking the Sky Sword Saint' continues its storytelling.]</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because this space was made up of the stories of 'Breaking the Sky Sword Saint'. Jung Heewon, without even using [Time of Judgment], was demonstrating combat prowess on par with me, a late-stage Narrative-grade fighter.</p>
<p>[Mad Sword Emperor! It's the Mad Sword Emperor!]</p>
<p>The Constellations, belatedly noticing Jung Heewon's presence, began to respond, but in an instant, their forces were already halved.</p>
<p>[Omnipotent Sun! You never said that person was with him!]</p>
<p>[How could a mere incarnation—]</p>
<p>It's worth fighting. If we steadily reduce their forces one by one, leaving only Apollo and Vidar...</p>
<p>[Tamra! How long are you going to just watch!]</p>
<p>Apollo's mantra rang out, and the southern sky lit up.</p>
<p>Damn it, things couldn't be resolved that easily.</p>
<p>[The Constellations of Nebula &lt;Tamra&gt; gaze upon the battlefield!]</p>
<p>This is the territory of &lt;Tamra Heavy Industry&gt;, even within the 'New Murim District'. The Constellations that originally occupied this area have finally begun to intervene.</p>
<p>[You came in first like a rat, and now you look pathetic.]</p>
<p>A flash of light emanated from the sky, accompanied by an eerie sensation. I raised my head and saw over fifty Constellations falling.</p>
<p>A tremendous spectacle of light filled one side of the sky.</p>
<p>With the words of the 'Ways of Survival' flashing through my mind, I immediately recognized them.</p>
<p>「'The Five Hundred Generals'.」</p>
<p>The Mythical Constellation of Tamra—the descendants of Seolmundae Halmang, the 'Island of Pregnancy', and the key figures who enabled the small Constellation Tamra to stand against the giant Constellation.</p>
<p>They were led by a long-haired goddess with an uncanny waist.</p>
<p>[The Constellation, 'Master of Baekrokdam', reveals her true character.]</p>
<p>Master of Baekrokdam. One of the great generals of Tamra, leading the Five Hundred Generals.</p>
<p>「General Halla.」</p>
<p>The great general of Tamra, representing the Korean Peninsula alongside Hongik, finally revealed her true form.</p>
<p>Apollo, narrowing his eyes, rebuked her.</p>
<p>"Halla, why are you so late?"</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because some of the Five Hundred Generals, the main force of Tamra, were strong. An ominous air of probability was flowing through the skies.</p>
<p>"Dokja-ssi."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, standing beside me, spoke nervously. I exchanged a glance with her and then looked at General Halla.</p>
<p>General Halla, too, was a Constellation that had consumed my brother's flesh and blood. I had been thinking that perhaps it was time for her to appear. The fact that she had even descended here with some of the Five Hundred Generals must mean she was serious about this matter.</p>
<p>[General Halla, I have heard of your reputation.]</p>
<p>I deliberately tried to speak to her. Unlike other Constellations, the 'Master of Baekrokdam' had not been one to cast a hostile gaze upon me.</p>
<p>As if to confirm this, Halla gazed deeply into my eyes and replied.</p>
<p>[Little Constellation of the peninsula, things have turned out badly.]</p>
<p>As expected.</p>
<p>Halla knew I was from the same peninsula.</p>
<p>Perhaps she'd heard the story from other Constellations, like the Goryeo Swordsman or the Maritime War God.</p>
<p>[Is your presence here something Hongik agreed to?]</p>
<p>[We Tamra do not seek Hongik's permission.]</p>
<p>[Why are you interfering in this? Wasn't Tamra a noble Constellation? Surely a Constellation like you wouldn't be aiming for the position of Seolmundae Halmang?]</p>
<p>Perhaps because I mentioned Seolmundae Halmang, a Mythical Constellation from Tamra? General Halla replied with a subtle expression.</p>
<p>[Child, I've heard rumors about you. Just as I've heard, you're quite the talker. I, too, would like to witness more of your story, but alas, time in this world doesn't allow it. Although your story ends here, your convictions will live on through the Shindansu.]</p>
<p>[Shut up, Halla. This tree will become the World Tree.]</p>
<p>Halla glared at Apollo with a slightly annoyed expression, then smiled gently at me and continued.</p>
<p>[Don't worry, we'll send you off in peace. We've prepared a special end for you.]</p>
<p>As General Halla raised her sword into the air, a cloud of probability appeared, gathering in the air like a dark cloud.</p>
<p>['Fate' is being recorded.]</p>
<p>Fate. The Nebula &lt;Tamra&gt; had directly influenced the Recorders.</p>
<p>「Kim Dokja will be absorbed into the 'Impossible Justice'—a Fear worthy of a genius.」</p>
<p>The word [Fate] was written with a great deal of probability. It seemed that the Recorder group known as 'Janggwang Library', who had previously bestowed [Fate] on me, had now joined forces with &lt;Tamra Heavy Industry&gt;.</p>
<p>[Halla, don't let your guard down. He has twisted 'Fate' before.]</p>
<p>[There's no need to worry about that. Our &lt;Tamra&gt; also staked its existence on this 'Fate'.]</p>
<p>As if certain that I could not change [Fate], a flicker of sympathy flashed across General Halla's eyes.</p>
<p>[Your Fate is about to be realized.]</p>
<p>The shadow of the tree grew slowly. The dark shadow covered the area, drawing everything in.</p>
<p>「This [Fate] is unavoidable.」</p>
<p>The fact that [Fate] was declared so quickly meant, though perhaps not, that the Grand Narrative of &lt;Tamra&gt; had been sacrificed to the realization of my fate.</p>
<p>All directions were surrounded by &lt;Tamra&gt;'s five hundred generals, &lt;Olympus&gt;, and the Constellations of &lt;Asgard&gt;, and my [Fate] was about to be realized.</p>
<p>I thought of my brother, who must have foreseen all this, and my other brothers who must have been watching.</p>
<p>How would they, Kim Dokja, have handled this situation?</p>
<p>What would be the most 'Kim Dokja-like' action right now?</p>
<p>[So you're asking me to be the sacrifice now? Right?]</p>
<p>The answer wasn't difficult.</p>
<p>[Good. Listen.]</p>
<p>General Halla smiled brightly, unsure of how she had perceived my words.</p>
<p>[Child of the Peninsula, &lt;Tamra&gt; rejoices in your sacrifice—]</p>
<p>[But if you're going to offer a sacrifice, wouldn't it be better if there were more?]</p>
<p>I took off my coat. Then I tore even the shirt I was wearing.</p>
<p>Stories dripped from the still-healing wound on my chest. From afar, I saw the Constellations' gazes change as they recognized my stories.</p>
<p>[I wonder how far your patience will go.]</p>
<p>Gripping my 'Unbreakable Faith', I made small cuts all over my upper body. As stories began to flow out in even greater quantities than before, the area soon became filled with the scent of my blood.</p>
<p>A Constellation took a step toward me.</p>
<p>[Wait. What are you all doing!]</p>
<p>I heard Apollo's bewildered cry, but the Constellations were already approaching me, as if possessed. When a story they desire is right before their eyes, there aren't many Constellations who can resist turning the page. That's why they're called Constellations.</p>
<p>I smiled at them and said,</p>
<p>[Why do you love 'stories' so much—]</p>
<p>Constellations.</p>
<p>Embracing the stories of incarnations they've never seen before, feeling angry, sad, happy, and willing to shine their light for them—</p>
<p>[Aren't you curious why?]</p>
<p>Beings who ultimately desire to become 'one' through a contract.</p>
<p>「The Constellations, having smelled the scent of the story, suddenly transformed and began to rush forward.」</p>
<p>General Halla, Apollo, and Vidar belatedly stepped in to stop them, but the situation was already out of control. In fact, their eyes were filled with desire.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.???', activates.]</p>
<p>It will be difficult for them to suppress their desires. Because—</p>
<p>[Halla. Apollo. Vidar.]</p>
<p>They've already tasted this story once.</p>
<p>[Come back. The story you desire is here.]</p>
<p>As the shadow of the tree spread across the area, the story my brother had bestowed upon them was reenacted on stage.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Star Communion', begins.]</p>
<p>In an instant, the Constellations rushed in, sinking their teeth into my torso like beasts. Even as I felt the story being torn away, I smiled and remained conscious.</p>
<p>[You ate my blood and flesh.]</p>
<p>The Constellations, belatedly regaining their senses, wavered in their eyes. Unable to laugh or cry, the Constellations, intoxicated by the story, groaned.</p>
<p>I looked down at them and said,</p>
<p>[Now we will share our fate.]</p>
<p>Soon, the shadow of the tree, now pitch-black, swallowed up all the starlight.</p>
<p>[Your 'Fate' will be realized.]</p>
