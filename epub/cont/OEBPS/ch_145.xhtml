<hr/>
<p>An hour after Cheon Inho fainted, Yoo Joonghyuk went to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The group that came with him was as follows.</p>
<p>Steel Emperor Lee Hyunsung.</p>
<p>Maritime Admiral Lee Jihye.</p>
<p>Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon.</p>
<p>Doctor Lee Seolhwa.</p>
<p>Beast Tamer Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p>The five incarnations who have been by his side for the past dozens of rounds.</p>
<p>If you look closely, they were all people with at least one flaw.</p>
<p>Lee Hyunsung was too foolish, and Lee Jihye was too simple. Kim Namwoon was a crazy person, and Lee Seolhwa was often bitter. Shin Yoosoung was weak-hearted.</p>
<p>He repeatedly changed the main members or formed new parties several times.</p>
<p>But in the end, these are the five that remain. They were the only ones who stayed by Yoo Joonghyuk's side until the very end.</p>
<p>"Ugh, this is my first time in America. Has Seolhwa ever been here?"</p>
<p>Lee Seolhwa answered Lee Jihye’s question with a faint smile.</p>
<p>"When I was young."</p>
<p>"Tsk. I know a lot about America. Jihye, are you curious?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"I’m nervous because the only time I ever deployed troops was to Iraq."</p>
<p>"Hyunsung, you’re always nervous."</p>
<p>Compared to the previous round, the mood among the group was brighter.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk found Shin Yoosoung remaining silent alone in the midst of a lively conversation. Although she originally had a dark personality, the shadow that now fell on Shin Yoosoung's face was not just due to her personality.</p>
<p>As Yoo Joonghyuk was about to approach Shin Yoosoung, a voice was heard from behind.</p>
<p>"That’s amazing. Is that the status of the 'Five Heavenly Emperors' who protect the Supreme King?"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk frowned and thought. Looking back, there was another 'party that came with him'. He just didn't consider them his companions.</p>
<p>"Five Heavenly Emperors? Was there a nickname like that?"</p>
<p>"I attached it."</p>
<p>"Do not pollute the Book of Revelation."</p>
<p>A beautiful woman sighed lightly behind two bickering young men.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk knew who they were.</p>
<p>Kang Ilhoon, although his tone is harsh, is believed to be the incarnation of an archangel.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo, the de facto leader of the Chungmuro Group and the teammate of Armed Castle Lord Gong Pildu.</p>
<p>Lee Seyeon who possesses strong interpersonal fighting skills and is armed with S-class or higher items.</p>
<p>They were the incarnations who quickly emerged as new powerhouses in this round.</p>
<p>Although he never told anyone, Yoo Joonghyuk knew one thing the three had in common.</p>
<p>'They are past evildoers.'</p>
<p>Their names remained in his memories of the last round that came to mind.</p>
<p>Small villains who were major thieves, betrayed their party, or became looters.</p>
<p>These little villains were proudly leading the incarnations to the forefront of the main scenario this time.</p>
<p>To be exact, it wasn't just them.</p>
<p>"Dansu ahjussi, why are you sighing like that?"</p>
<p>Another man and woman followed behind them.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk even knew their names.</p>
<p>"As expected, I’m worried about Inho-ssi. I should have stayed too."</p>
<p>Although not as strong as Lee Hyunsung, Kyung Sein is the second-strongest tanker after Lee Hyunsung.</p>
<p>Although his fighting skills are not outstanding, Lee Dansu reminds him of 'Selena Kim', who was the Immortal King in the previous round.</p>
<p>If he remembers well, he also had a minor dispute with these incarnations in a certain round.</p>
<p>'Is it a coincidence? Or not…'</p>
<p>Even if it was a coincidence, there was nothing particularly strange about it.</p>
<p>In the countless rounds of his life, every human being, including Yoo Joonghyuk himself, became a villain at least once.</p>
<p>What Yoo Joonghyuk learned through this was that humans are just empty vessels.</p>
<p>All humans become completely different beings depending on what kind of 'tale' they face and what kind of story they live.</p>
<p>He knows it's true.</p>
<p>However, it was not easy to admit the truth that just one man instigated it.</p>
<p>'Cheon Inho.'</p>
<p>So far, without a single exception, 'Cheon Inho' has been a villain in all rounds. Whether small or large, he became a villain and blocked Yoo Joonghyuk's path.</p>
<p>As if that was his absolute mission.</p>
<p>However, 'Cheon Inho' in this round has not yet become a villain.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk found that fact very strange.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about?"</p>
<p>Yoo Mia, who was walking next to him, squeezed his left hand. Yoo Joonghyuk spoke without shaking her hand.</p>
<p>"It is nothing."</p>
<p>"You thought of the man with narrow eyes."</p>
<p>"He is dangerous."</p>
<p>"He looks like that old swindler."</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>"But if you listen to what people say, he seems to be a good swindler."</p>
<p>'Good swindler.'</p>
<p>While Yoo Joonghyuk was surprised that young Yoo Mia knew such an expression, he wondered whether he should correct the contradiction in the expression.</p>
<p>But he couldn't think of anything to retort.</p>
<p>Instead, Yoo Joonghyuk decided to recall the memories of the last round.</p>
<p>What a bad guy he was in the last round and how dangerous it is to trust him...</p>
<p>['The Redemption of Truth' controls your memory.]</p>
<p>Redemption of Truth.</p>
<p>One of the three stories he engraved.</p>
<p>This imprint seals some of the memories in exchange for great power.</p>
<p>Although he was a little concerned that this memory had been sealed, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't really care.</p>
<p>In any case, the 'memory' that would be the key to clearing this round was remembered by someone other than him.</p>
<p>"It’s been a long time, King Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p>Across from the casino hotel stood the person whose memories he wanted.</p>
<p>Zarathustra's representative and his old enemy.</p>
<p>"Anna Croft."</p>
<hr/>
<p>While heading to the Washington Dome, Yoo Joonghyuk tried to avoid eye contact with Anna Croft as much as possible.</p>
<p>['Emotional restraint' stirs.]</p>
<p>This is because it was difficult to handle the growing excitement in real time.</p>
<p>He wanted to bring Cheon Inho to prepare for this kind of situation.</p>
<p>But it might be too late to turn back now.</p>
<p>"Prophet. There is a memory I need. Use [past tense]."</p>
<p>"I exhausted all my reps today."</p>
<p>[You are using 'Lie Detection'.]</p>
<p>['Lie Detection' confirmed that the statement was true.]</p>
<p>Anna Croft's expression hardened at the message about using the skill.</p>
<p>"Lie Detection, do you not have the minimum level of trust?"</p>
<p>"I’d rather trust a good swindler than trust you."</p>
<p>"Who is the good swindler?"</p>
<p>"Don’t pry into unnecessary things."</p>
<p>"You brought it up first—"</p>
<p>"I’ll tell you in advance, I don’t have much patience in this round."</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Anna Croft glared at him with disapproving eyes.</p>
<p>At that moment, Yu Joonghyuk felt the urge to pull out his spear and hit her on the head.</p>
<p>This was because dozens of past tragedies caused by Anna Croft came to mind all at once.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill 'Redemption Lv.5' is being activated.]</p>
<p>[The influence of 'Redemption' is temporarily weakened by the effect of 'Three Persons'.]</p>
<p>But he had to endure it.</p>
<p>At least she'll be useful until all the constellations in this world run out.</p>
<p>However, the moment Yoo Joonghyuk checked the local situation, he began to doubt Anna Croft's 'usefulness'.</p>
<p>"Why did the scenario end up like this?"</p>
<p>In only the fifth scenario, the entire Washington Dome was eroded.</p>
<p>The surviving incarnations make up about 5% of the entire population of the dome.</p>
<p>This was something that had never happened in any round before.</p>
<p>"An unexpected situation occurred."</p>
<p>"There’s always something like that."</p>
<p>"I had a plan."</p>
<p>"A plan that cannot be kept is useless. If you cannot come up with a convincing answer, you will die here."</p>
<p>Anna Croft let out a deep sigh at his threat. It was a strangely despondent sigh that he had never seen before in any round.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk. Have you ever heard of a group called 'Apostles'?"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk nodded his head.</p>
<p>"As expected... it looks like they were in Korea too."</p>
<p>Judging by the way she spoke, it seemed that Washington's downfall had something to do with the 'Apostles'.</p>
<p>"Could it be that Korea also failed to kill the disasters?"</p>
<p>"I am in Korea."</p>
<p>"Of course it is. I was just asking just in case."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk ended the fifth scenario in Korea.</p>
<p>A disaster that was different from his memories appeared and the method of dealing with it was a little different from the previous round, but the scenario itself went smoothly anyway.</p>
<p>"It hasn’t been smooth sailing for us."</p>
<p>"I guess I know roughly what the situation is."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk also heard something about the 'Apostles'.</p>
<p>Beings who know the 'future' of the world.</p>
<p>"That’s what happens because you rely too much on things like [future sight]. You probably know that there is no such thing as a fixed future."</p>
<p>"The future was written. Until they showed up."</p>
<p>Anna Croft has been clearing the scenarios by reading the future and preparing for it.</p>
<p>However, in this round, the variable 'Apostles' intervened and all her plans went awry.</p>
<p>"If you help me with this matter, I will definitely repay your debt, King."</p>
<p>"I hope you can continue to be useful until the debt is paid."</p>
<p>The moment they entered the portal, the surrounding scenery changed into waves.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk had his companions wait for a while and then went up to a nearby high-rise building to check the view.</p>
<p>This was not his first time visiting the Washington Dome.</p>
<p>But it was his first time seeing a scene like this.</p>
<p>It seemed as if the entire city was buried in pitch-black ashes.</p>
<p>There was no sight of living incarnations anywhere.</p>
<p>All the high-rise buildings that made up the skyscrapers were in ruins, and the sky was covered with fog that obscured even the light of the stars.</p>
<p>On the roof of the building, black roots reminiscent of a tree growing upside down were sprouting.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk tore off the root without hesitation.</p>
<p>Then, a roaring black ether poured out between the torn roots.</p>
<p>A 'dark root' that vomits demonic energy.</p>
<p>It was definitely true.</p>
<p>'The Demon Realm.'</p>
<p>He doesn't know what number this demon realm was, but the 'Washington Dome' was invaded by a demon realm.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk, who landed lightly on the ground, asked Anna.</p>
<p>"Have you secured the parts of the Earth Dragon species?"</p>
<p>"I’m trying."</p>
<p>In order to fight in an invaded demon world, [Purification] work is essential. Otherwise, you will be cursed.</p>
<p>[Currently, the 'Washington Dome' has been eroded by the demon realm.]</p>
<p>['Local curse' is activated!]</p>
<p>[Spiritual power decreases slightly in the area!]</p>
<p>[Comprehensive stats are partially reduced in that area!]</p>
<p>Judging from the extent of the invasion, it was not yet at an irreversible level.</p>
<p>However, if the scenario proceeds like this, leaving Washington alone, the city will truly become part of the 'Demon Realm'.</p>
<p>As time goes by, the Demon Realm will expand and eventually the entire Earth will fall under the Demon King.</p>
<p>That must be prevented at all costs.</p>
<p>“What kind of demon king is it?”</p>
<p>Now, let's go to the seventh scenario, the Washington Dome.</p>
<p>The demon king will not be able to descend in person.</p>
<p>Therefore, there was a high possibility that the owner of this dome was a subordinate of a specific demon king.</p>
<p>"It was the first time I have ever heard this demon king."</p>
<p>"Was it your first time hearing about it?"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk knew the true names of all the demon kings who ruled the 72 demon worlds.</p>
<p>The same would apply to the prophet in front of him.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if a demon king with a name they had never heard of appeared, the implications of that fact were clear.</p>
<p>"Christina confirmed—"</p>
<p>A new 'Demon King' has appeared in the Demon Realm in this round.</p>
<p>"They called their master the 'Demon King of Salvation'."</p>
