<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">654 Episode 19 People of the Past (6)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>With Shin Yoosoung, I held my breath and hid between the underground passages.</p>
<p>Then, a group of people jumped out from the opposite street corner.</p>
<p>"This way!"</p>
<p>Did they notice us?</p>
<p>Looking at the movement, there is a feeling that they are intentionally directed this way, but the target is us.</p>
<p>I used 'group chat' with Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p>—Shin Yoosoung. You should run away immediately.</p>
<p>I felt that no matter what happened, I had to save this child.</p>
<p>If Shin Yoosoung dies here, the 41st round will end with the worst ending I can think of.</p>
<p>—If ahjussi runs away too.</p>
<p>A formidable answer came back.</p>
<p>I hesitated to answer, but Shin Yoosoung sent another message.</p>
<p>—But maybe we can win?</p>
<p>ㅡIt could be.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because of 'Beast Lord? Shin Yoo-seung seemed to be able to know the talents of incarnations just by looking at them.</p>
<p>[Story, 'the tenacious Murim master' shudders.]</p>
<p>The number and skill of the running enemies were excellent. It is only natural that they are the elite of the 7 kings of Seoul.</p>
<p>But do you think I will lose? If you ask me, I wouldn't.</p>
<p>Does that mean I've become stronger?</p>
<p>At first glance, I thought that I was stronger than Kim Dokja of the same period, but I hadn't had a chance to properly check my skills in the meantime.</p>
<p>However, it wasn't just that we were talking about the enemies.</p>
<p>—Those two over there are strong.</p>
<p>I could feel it too.</p>
<p>Two extraordinary auras were felt among them.</p>
<p>"Gu Taesung! This way! Move!"</p>
<p>Gu Taesung.</p>
<p>One of the 7 kings of Seoul. A person who has Gyeonwon, the king of Later Baekje, as his background.</p>
<p>He was a man called 'The Dragon King'.</p>
<p>Next to him was an incarnation wearing a black night suit, but I couldn't guess who it was just by looking at his face.</p>
<p>"Assassin King. What's the target?"</p>
<p>"Now it's intelligent."</p>
<p>Assassin King.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the dungeon, the assassins who tried to harm us told us this name.</p>
<p>Somehow, that man in the night suit seemed to be the leader of the rookie hunters.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'reader comment list' is activated!]</p>
<p>[This reader took an abnormal path .]</p>
<p>['Omniscient reader's viewpoint  was used.]</p>
<p>A message I’ve seen before.</p>
<p>It was the same case as the text book writer I met in the 'Theatre Dungeon'.</p>
<p>「It’s the Misreading association.」</p>
<p>Those who possessed characters here after illegally reading the novel.</p>
<p>From what I could see, both Gu Taesung, the Dragon King, and the Assassin King were all on that side.</p>
<p>ㅡbig star.</p>
<p>The Dustman's reaction also changed.</p>
<p>It probably means that the two of them have a 'star jewel'. Shin Yoosoung, who was by my side, turned to the Dustman, placing her finger on her lips as if telling him to be quiet.</p>
<p>—Ahjussi, what should I do?</p>
<p>—Let's observe the situation for a moment.</p>
<p>Bang Cheolsoo's warning came to mind.</p>
<p>「"Brother, if you meet the 7 kings of Seoul, you must avoid them unconditionally."」</p>
<p>Until now, I thought so. It was important to collect star jewels, but I had no intention of taking unnecessary risks with Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>「Isn't that worth fighting for?」</p>
<p>When I asked why that thought came to my mind, I was comparing them to someone without realizing it.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'The Last Ark' laughs.]</p>
<p>Come to think of it, the king of beggars I faced at Seoul Station was the body of a constellation.</p>
<p>No matter how strong the 7 kings of Seoul are, they are only the incarnations of a great constellation.</p>
<p>In a sense, I've already had a record of dealing with a first-class incarnation.</p>
<p>I was thinking about whether to attack now, but I decided to eavesdrop on their conversation.</p>
<p>"What about troop losses?"</p>
<p>"There were a few minor injuries, but no fatalities."</p>
<p>"No fatalities?"</p>
<p>Intermittent murmurings could be heard from a distance.</p>
<p>It was a vibration I had heard before.</p>
<p>"Did you not hear? He said he doesn't kill anyone."</p>
<p>"He’s not killing anyone."</p>
<p>"There are rumors that they are members of the apostle side."</p>
<p>Apostle?</p>
<p>"I don't like their hypocrisy. It's just like them and us who read a damn novel anyway."</p>
<p>"That's true. What's the point of spending a few hundred won on that?"</p>
<p>I resisted the urge to go right away and slap him in the back of the head.</p>
<p>By the way, are you insane for talking about things like that?</p>
<p>[A few constellations protest why there are so many filtered conversations these days.]</p>
<p>It's a conversation that is filtered anyway, so they don't have any intention of hiding it.</p>
<p>"What happened to the possessed constellation? Have you been contacted?"</p>
<p>"No. Not yet. It looks like it's been a bit of time."</p>
<p>"You damn bastards. Then why mess with the Goryeo's First Sword?"</p>
<p>"They don't even know the contents of their novels. We should have done the constellation possession."</p>
<p>As the vibration that resonated with the labyrinth approached, the two men shut their mouths at the same time.</p>
<p>"It’s coming."</p>
<p>The faces of the two people had a strange tension. Then came the sound of flesh being torn from the aisle and an horrible scream.</p>
<p>Then, with the sound of gasping for breath, incarnations appeared. An incarnation with one arm ripped off. An incarnation with a broken shin. The incarnations who lost all their weapons ran this way in a hurry.</p>
<p>Even seeing the injured men, the two did not look too surprised.</p>
<p>As if they had foreseen this situation.</p>
<p>"Is that what happens when you collect three star jewels?"</p>
<p>"If you're jealous, I'll hand over my star jewel to you."</p>
<p>"I decline."</p>
<p>A gigantic figure swayed behind the avatars.</p>
<p>At first glance, a gigantic creature that appears to be twice the size of an ordinary incarnation.</p>
<p>Could that be the Labyrinth Keeper?</p>
<p>The Dustman, who was spinning around, couldn't control himself and shivered.</p>
<p>ㅡBig star!</p>
<p>Not a Labyrinth Keeper.</p>
<p>In other words, that monster is also an 'incarnation' like us.</p>
<p>However, was there such an incarnation in Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint?</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, who was next to me, was also holding on to my sleeve, as if surprised.</p>
<p>A slight tremor passed through the child's fingertips.</p>
<p>"That can't be won."</p>
<p>The hairs on the backs of my hands were warning me.</p>
<p>I couldn't see the form properly yet, but the giant in the darkness was stronger than Gu Taesung and the assassin king combined.</p>
<p>Who the hell is it?</p>
<p>At this point, if it is an existence with a level of combat power that exceeds the '7 kings of Seoul'.</p>
<p>"Light!"</p>
<p>Along with Gu Taesung's cry, someone lit a light in the darkness of the underground passage.</p>
<p>The giant's face was revealed to the whole world.</p>
<p>Arms filled with strong muscles.</p>
<p>Empty pupils as if he had lost his mind. Lips moving repeatedly as if chanting Buddhist prayers.</p>
<p>"I will not kill you. I won't kill you."</p>
<p>The moment I heard the voice, I got goosebumps.</p>
<p>—Ahjussi?</p>
<p>I forgot to reply to Shin Yoosoung and ran out.</p>
<p>"Wow! What is it?"</p>
<p>One of the incarnations that spotted me jumping through the aisle brandished a blind knife.</p>
<p>After receiving the blade as it was, I tripped the incarnation.</p>
<p>The incarnation let out a small scream and fell down on the back of his head before making a pack sound.</p>
<p>Did he die? I don't know.</p>
<p>However, now was not the time to be immersed in sentimentality.</p>
<p>I was looking at a giant.</p>
<p>"Looking for someone. I'm looking for someone."</p>
<p>Why is that person here?</p>
<p>I could see her man's thick hand poking through the air.</p>
<p>It was a different size, but it was a hand I knew well.</p>
<p>The person who asked me where the bugs were. With that hand, he found the bug under the vending machine.</p>
<p>"Find someone."</p>
<p>It felt like a part of my chest was about to collapse.</p>
<p>The first reader I met after possessing someone in this world.</p>
<p>A man who was brought into this world for reading a novel his daughter was reading.</p>
<p>"Noh Jiyoon. Noh Jiyoon."</p>
<p>Jiyoon's father.</p>
<p>"Dansu ahjussi!"</p>
<p>However, as if he couldn't hear my voice, he only repeated vain gestures toward the air.</p>
<p>If you look closely, you can see that the old man's eyes are black.</p>
<p>My breath choked, and deep anger and sorrow rushed at once.</p>
<p>What the hell happened in the meantime?</p>
<p>Why did Ahjussi become like that?</p>
<p>What the hell kind of people made you like that?</p>
<p>Could it be because of the life that flowed out in an instant? A group of incarnations looked back at my width.</p>
<p>I could see Gu Taesung and the Assassin King frowning at me.</p>
<p>I saw them face to face.</p>
<p>Are these guys the ones who made you that way?</p>
<p>"Are you a hindrance?"</p>
<p>The assassin king who found me muttered in a calm voice.</p>
<p>At the same time, the sound of flesh breaking was heard from the front of the aisle.</p>
<p>[The incarnation 'Dansu' has currently acquired 3 Star Jewels.]</p>
<p>Every time Dansu Ahjussi swung his giant hand. The incarnations were helplessly swept away.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>The incarnations who were hit by ahjussi were injured, but did not die. Moderate to minor injuries that do not end life.</p>
<p>"I won't kill you. I won't kill you."</p>
<p>Come to think of it, Dansu ahjussi was like that from the first scenario.</p>
<p>The man who killed a bug in the first scenario has never killed a person.</p>
<p>「"It's just because I'm weak."」</p>
<p>That's what he said, but I knew why the old man didn't really kill people.</p>
<p>A man who is always looking for his daughter.</p>
<p>There is only one reason why such a man does not kill people.</p>
<p>「"I want Jiyoon to be proud of me."」</p>
<p>"Dansu ahjussi! Calm down!"</p>
<p>He looked around as if he still couldn't hear me.</p>
<p>One of the incarnations that had been paying attention suddenly attacked me from behind. However, the incarnation was struck in the neck by a dagger flying from the side and fell down.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi."</p>
<p>It was Shin Yoosoung. I nodded and looked around at the incarnations around me. No matter how I look at it, these guys are the ones who are aiming for Dansu ahjussi, so it was urgent to deal with these guys first.</p>
<p>It was then that Gu Taesung, who was checking his watch, raised his head.</p>
<p>"I think you misunderstood. We don't intend to fight."</p>
<p>You don't want to fight?</p>
<p>The guy looked back at the members of his group who had fallen to me and Shin Yoosoung, then clicked his tongue and said.</p>
<p>"You don't know what's going on right now?"</p>
<p>"Old Taesung. Don't talk nonsense."</p>
<p>Despite the Assassin King's warning, Gu Taesung looked at my width and continued.</p>
<p>"Looks like you’re on the edge. Let me give you a piece of advice. You'd better get away from here quickly. Or you'll get run over by that monster too."</p>
<p>"Gu Taesung. He's here."</p>
<p>With those words, Gu Taesung and the Assassin King moved. I nervously grabbed the hilt of my sword. If I had to, I was thinking of cutting the backs of the kings to save ahjussi.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>"Just throw food and it will fall."</p>
<p>Instead of grabbing weapons, Gu Taesung and the Assassin King reached out for their own Dustmen.</p>
<p>ㅡLight up.</p>
<p>Two shining white jewels protruded from the little Dustman's mouth.</p>
<p>It must have been. It was the 'Star Jewel' that we had been looking for all along.</p>
<p>It was the continued actions of the guys that made it happen.</p>
<p>"Eat it, you bastard!"</p>
<p>They threw their star jewels at Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>A star jewel flew towards the man who was repeating his apology into the air. After that, the Dustman, who was flying near ahjussi, opened his mouth wide.</p>
<p>[Incarnation 'Lee Dansu' gets 2 additional 'Star Jewels'!]</p>
<p>At the same time, cracks began to appear all over ahjussi’s body.</p>
<p>With a crackling sound, ahjussi’s muscles were torn and swollen.</p>
<p>The Assassin King let out an unpleasant laugh.</p>
<p>"It's a success."</p>
<p>"Now just feed two more and we’re done. Everyone withdraw!"</p>
<p>The Assassin King and Gu Taesung's group seemed to have finished their mission and didn't look back.</p>
<p>I heard it everywhere in the labyrinth.</p>
<p>As if, from the beginning, they had no intention of hunting him.</p>
<p>I couldn't understand what the hell was going on.</p>
<p>I sorted out the situation in the confusion.</p>
<p>One, Dansu ahjussi already had three star jewels.</p>
<p>If I were to simply summarize the situation that was happening right in front of my eyes, that would be it.</p>
<p>"They gave the star jewel to Dansu ahjussi on purpose."</p>
<p>Why? He already had three star jewels.</p>
<p>If he gets two more star jewels in that situation, the old man will only become ridiculously strong.</p>
<p>"By the way, was that all?"</p>
<p>Belatedly, the rules of this dungeon came to mind.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>8. Every time you acquire 1 'Star Jewel', the 'Madness' level increases.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>I approached Dansu ahjussi who was kneeling.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi! It's me! Ahjussi!"</p>
<p>Dansu ahjussi, who had grown even bigger than before, had now grown to the point of being reminiscent of a small giant.</p>
<p>I could feel his presence just by getting close.</p>
<p>As if reminiscent of Yoo Joonghyuk, a sense of heavy pressure that chokes your breath.</p>
<p>To the old man who was crying and scratching the floor as if in pain, I stretched out my hands and shouted.</p>
<p>"Me, Cheon Inho! Take a seat!"</p>
<p>At the word Cheon Inho, the man raised his head. For an instant, hope welled up.</p>
<p>Does he recognize me?</p>
<p>Ahjussi’s lips were saying something.</p>
<p>Jiyoon.</p>
<p>The next moment, ahjussi’s huge palm flew towards me. It was a relentless blow with no chance to escape. If Shin Yoosoung hadn't pulled my back just in time, I might have been crushed by it.</p>
<p>I looked down at the floor where Dansu ahjussi’s palm had been planted. The floor was severely cracked with the palm at the center.</p>
<p>Cold sweat ran down my back.</p>
<p>I was about to die. Really, I almost died.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, holding onto my sleeve, was shouting something, but I could only hear what ahjussi said.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>A man who repeats an apology. The man who had lost both eyes looked at me with wide open pupils.</p>
<p>[Incarnation 'Lee Dansu' has fallen into 'Madness Level 5'.]</p>
<p>Madness level 5.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>9. Every time the 'Madness' stage goes up, the overall ability increases greatly and you lose your sanity.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Only then did I understand why the 7 kings abandoned the star jewels and fled.</p>
<p>The tenth rule came to mind soon after.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>10. If someone collects 7 Star Jewels, the Death Sword will be summoned.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Goosebumps ran down my spine.</p>
<p>「The goal of this place was not to collect 7 jewels.」</p>
<p>The 'star jewels' in this dungeon were a trap.</p>
<p>'Star Jewels' that made one lose their reason in return for gaining strong power.</p>
<p>In other words, in order to properly collect 'star jewels', you should never collect 'star jewels'.</p>
<p>Therefore, the goal of this dungeon was as follows.</p>
<p>「To make someone other than yourself collect '7 star jewels'.」</p>
<p>Dansu ahjussi, who became a monster, slowly got up and started walking towards me.</p>
