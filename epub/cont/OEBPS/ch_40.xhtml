<hr/>
<p>"D-did you just say Jiyoon?"</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi asked, and Ye Hyunwoo frowned warily.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Jiyoon! Do you know Jiyoon?"</p>
<p>"She's my friend, why?"</p>
<p>"Where is Jiyoon now?"</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo looked in my direction, startled by ahjussi's sudden outburst.</p>
<p>I tried to calm ahjussi down as he breathed heavily.</p>
<p>"His daughter's name is 'No Jiyoon'."</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo's eyes widened.</p>
<p>"No Jiyoon? Really?"</p>
<p>After looking back and forth between me and the ahjussi, Ye Hyunwoo muttered in a cautious voice.</p>
<p>"But it could be someone with the same name......."</p>
<p>"Hyunwoo-ssi, is your friend the same Jiyoon who said she's going to marry Yoo Joonghyuk in the future?"</p>
<p>In response to my question, Ye Hyunwoo nodded with a dazed expression.</p>
<p>"Huh? That's right. Wow, you really are Jiyoon's father. No, but if you're here means Omniscient Reader......."</p>
<p>"Where is Jiyoon now?"</p>
<p>He was his daughter's first acquaintance he met since crossing over to this world. Dansoo ahjussi was almost out of breath.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry....... I haven't met Jiyoon since I came here either."</p>
<p>"Ah......."</p>
<p>"But Jiyoon must be here somewhere too. I was dragged to the theater by her."</p>
<p>At the mention of the theater, Kyung Sein asked.</p>
<p>"Did you happen to be at 'Kim Dokja's Banquet' as well?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Were you too?"</p>
<p>"I was there too......."</p>
<p>As expected, most of the readers in the theater were transmigrated into this world.</p>
<p>Even Dansoo ahjussi chimed in.</p>
<p>"I was in the hospital when I was suddenly brought in......."</p>
<p>He was possessed even though he was outside the theater. Then maybe it wasn't just the people in the theater who came.</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo sighed and added.</p>
<p>"If I had known this would happen, I wouldn't have gone. I was in a really good mood until I got the quiz right. I was looking forward to the gift since I got the difficult quiz right......."</p>
<p>"What did you get right?"</p>
<p>"Well, the meaning of 1,863......."</p>
<p>"Oh, so that was the 7th Apostle."</p>
<p>I also vaguely remembered.</p>
<p>The person who, in a confident voice, correlated Yoo Joonghyuk's regressions with the year the first subway opened.</p>
<p>Maybe the girl sitting next to him was the one who asked if Kim Dokja was resurrected.</p>
<p>Then, was the girl who asked about Kim Dokja Jiyoon?</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo sighed as if it was a habit already and glanced in the direction of Yoo Joonghyuk, who was still pacing the railroad tracks.</p>
<p>"I haven't seen Jiyoon since we got separated at that time. Of course I thought she'd be by Yoo Joonghyuk's side by now...... She doesn't seem to be possessing Jihye."</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi's expression darkened sharply at the offhand remark.</p>
<p>"Still, if it's Jiyoon, she's alive somewhere, so don't worry too much. There's no way such a tough girl could be dead, and she's read the Book of Revelation more than I have."</p>
<p>I paused when I heard that.</p>
<p>Jiyoon had read it more than 50 times?</p>
<p>As if to change the subject, Ye Hyunwoo smiled slightly.</p>
<p>"By the way, it's amazing that you've made it this far already. I've read it 50 times, but I was lucky enough to start near Chungmuro, but you guys......."</p>
<p>"We started at Geumho Station."</p>
<p>"Wow, at 'Geumho Station'? Well, since you're 'Cheon Inho'...... So you met Jung Heewon there too, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon was talking to Lee Jihye a dozen steps away. Apparently, Lee Jihye took the initiative to ask her questions.</p>
<p>"It's really unusual. Jung Heewon becoming a colleague with Cheon Inho... Is this development okay?"</p>
<p>When he asked me that, I was speechless.</p>
<p>I thought it was a novelty in terms of development.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I'm relieved to see other members of the Apostles. It was really hard to deal with Killer King when he came with a bunch of kids from the Misreading Association."</p>
<p>The moment I heard those words, I remembered the dead bodies of the outer species at the front of the tunnel. Apparently, it was the work of Ye Hyunwoo and Gong Pildu.</p>
<p>"Did the Misreading Association attack here as well?"</p>
<p>"You've already met them, right?"</p>
<p>"Thanks to Killer King."</p>
<p>"Eh, that asshole...... Anyway, they came here as well. It seems like they prepared a lot for this early rush. Of course, I think they definitely underestimated the third stage of my Invincible Castellan tech tree."</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo seemed to have a special attachment to Gong Pildu and talked to us about his Plan to Raise an Invisible Castellan at Home for a while.</p>
<p>I wonder how much he talked.</p>
<p>"I want to go home."</p>
<p>I felt like I had been pricked by a thorn in the middle of the heart.</p>
<p>I don't know how long it had been, but Ye Hyunwoo had tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>It belatedly dawned on me that Ye Hyunwoo was Jiyoon's age.</p>
<p>On the surface, everyone seemed excited to be in a novel, but there was no way anyone would really want to be in an apocalypse like this.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein clenched her fists, and Dansoo ahjussi, who had stood up from his seat, reached over the boy's shoulder as if to comfort him.</p>
<p>It was then that we heard a voice from behind him.</p>
<p>"Stop talking and come here, kid."</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo rushed over and sat down next to Gong Pildu. Ye Hyunwoo whimpered, and Gong Pildu glared at me like he was going to kill me.</p>
<p>He's only in his mid-to-late teens. Such a child endured the first and second scenarios and survived to this point.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell him anything. That he would make it home safely. That nothing would happen.</p>
<p>But who am I to say that?</p>
<p>Tsuchuchuchut.</p>
<p>Everyone's pockets vibrated with the same sound.</p>
<p>One by one, with a slight time difference, we pulled out our phones.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein's nervous voice.</p>
<p>She wasn't the only one. Dansoo ahjussi and even Ye Hyunwoo, who was next to Gong Pildu, had similar faces.</p>
<p>The same message appeared on everyone's phone's screen.</p>
<p>—It's been a while. Dear readers.</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja sent a message.</p>
<p>"This, right nowᅳ"</p>
<p>I quickly looked around.</p>
<p>It was to see if we were the only ones looking at our phones.</p>
<p>"Let's check it first."</p>
<p>I opened the message.</p>
<p>—Hello, dear readers. By now, you're either on the second scenario or, if you're fast, already on the third.</p>
<p>—You've all survived well. Of course, some of you haven't, but what can I do? You should've read it harder.</p>
<p>The strange coolness in the way they speak.</p>
<p>Is this really a message from the 'RepresentativeKimDokja' I know?</p>
<p>—I'm sure you're all wondering. Why me? Did I do something wrong to be transmigrated into this world? Was it because I read that damn novel? But I didn't even say anything bad about it. Who the hell put me in this world and why?</p>
<p>Suddenly, I had an ominous premonition.</p>
<p>"Everyone! If you haven't seen the message yet—"</p>
<p>But I didn't finish my sentence.</p>
<p>—I'm sure you're frustrated. So, for those readers who have made it this far, I thought I'd give a little presentation on why you were brought to this world, and.</p>
<p>Tsuchuchuchut— I saw Kyung Sein, Dansoo ahjussi, and Ye Hyunwoo collapse one after another like dolls with broken threads.</p>
<p>—What you must accomplish to return to your original world.</p>
<p>My vision went black as well.</p>
<p>—See you soon then.</p>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
<p>A dark tunnel.</p>
<p>The woman in the white coat, who had been watching Chungmuro Station with a lollipop in her mouth, jumped up from her seat.</p>
<p>"Hey, remember all the guys whose phones just rang."</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' asks what's wrong with them.]</p>
<p>"They're all possessed. Also."</p>
<p>The woman added, checking the faces of Cheon Inho and his party who fell down one by one.</p>
<p>"Track the coordinates of the newly created subspace. Find out where their souls have been called. Quickly."</p>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
<p>When I opened my eyes, I was lying in a large lobby. As I got up, I realized that my eye level felt strangely familiar.</p>
<p>Slowly, my eyes adjusted and took in the scene around me.</p>
<p>The unlit ticket office and unmanned ticket machine.</p>
<p>It was Chungmuro's theater.</p>
<p>As I approached the ticket machine, I saw a face on the black screen.</p>
<p>My face was in it. Not Cheon Inho's face, but Lee Hakhyun's face.</p>
<p>I laughed out loud, and a sense of sadness crossed my mind. A deep sense of relief washed over me, along with an unexplainable sense of regret.</p>
<p>Maybe it was all a dream.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as transmigrating into a novel, after all. There's no way something like a web novel could suddenly happen to me.</p>
<p>It was then that the ceiling lit up.</p>
<p>A dazzling pillar of light descended from the surroundings, and people began to be summoned one by one.</p>
<p>"Uaaaah!"</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>Some people screamed, while others looked around with calm faces.</p>
<p>They appeared in an instant.</p>
<p>I realized who they were.</p>
<p>「Readers.」</p>
<p>The readers who had been transmigrated into the novel with me. It wasn't until I saw them that I realized.</p>
<p>We had all been called here, just as we were in the real world.</p>
<p>I quickly counted the people. A number that seemed more than a hundred, even at a rough count.</p>
<p>Apparently, there were more possessed people from other places besides those in the theater.</p>
<p>I had counted about a hundred and twenty of them when I spotted a head that stood out from the crowd.</p>
<p>I didn't recognize anyone else, but I recognized them.</p>
<p>"Sein-ssi."</p>
<p>"Eh? Who?"</p>
<p>The surprised man turned his head toward me, and I saw his name tag.</p>
<p>[JudgeHeewon].</p>
<p>The man seemed to recognize my name tag as well.</p>
<p>"I-Inho-ssi? You must be Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"Uaaah! Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p>Kyung Sein swooped down and gave me a big hug.</p>
<p>I quickly pulled away from him and asked.</p>
<p>"Did you see the others?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know the others' real faces."</p>
<p>Well, that's true, too.</p>
<p>As if they had realized what was happening, the sounds of people searching echoed around the room.</p>
<p>"Mijin-ah! Seo Mijin!"</p>
<p>"JihyesLove-nim! Is JihyesLove-nim here?"</p>
<p>"NamwoonsMom-nim!"</p>
<p>Come to think of it, there was someone I needed to find too. Maybe this was my only chance.</p>
<p>"Sein-ssi. I have to go somewhere for a while too."</p>
<p>"What? Inho-ssi! Wait!"</p>
<p>I pushed my way through the crowd, checking people's faces one by one.</p>
<p>"Ji Eunyoo-ssi! Is Ji Eunyoo-ssi here?"</p>
<p>Ji Eunyoo, my assignment editor.</p>
<p>The one who brought me to this theater. She must have transmigrated here too, because she read Omniscient Reader and answered the quiz correctly.</p>
<p>"Ji Eunyoo-ssi!"</p>
<p>But there was no sign of Ji Eunyoo.</p>
<p>Has she not been summoned yet?</p>
<p>Or........</p>
<p>I bit my lip hard. It wasn't anyone else, it was 'Ji Eunyoo'. The one who had probably read my novel more than me.</p>
<p>There's no way Ji Eunyoo didn't survive.</p>
<p>It was then that I heard a familiar name.</p>
<p>"Jiyoon-ah...... Jiyoon-ah!"</p>
<p>A neatly dressed middle-aged man was crouched on the ground, calling for someone desperately.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi."</p>
<p>As I approached, the middle-aged man looked up at me. It wasn't a face I remembered, but the moment I saw those eyes, I was sure.</p>
<p>"Inho...... Mate?"</p>
<p>It was the unmistakable Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The real-life Dansoo ahjussi was just as handsome as the novel version.</p>
<p>The only difference was that this man looked so pale that it wouldn't be strange if he collapsed immediately, and his body was built like a dry tree.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, mate, Jiyoon. Jiyoon, please......."</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi fainted on the spot leaving those words. His head was burning with fever. I hastily carried him on my back. His body was as light as a child's.</p>
<p>I looked around nervously.</p>
<p>Should I take him to the hospital?</p>
<p>But there was no way I could get there.</p>
<p>The theater's exits and elevators were blocked by translucent walls.</p>
<p>This wasn't the 'theater' we knew, but a subspace someone temporarily created.</p>
<p>There was no way to escape.</p>
<p>There was only one thing I could do now.</p>
<p>"Jiyoon-ah! No Jiyoon!"</p>
<p>I started shouting at the top of my lungs to the surrounding area. Kyung Sein, who hurriedly catched up, realized what was going on and shouted Jiyoon's name together with me.</p>
<p>"Jiyoon-ah, where are you!"</p>
<p>Time and time again, I saw children who looked like Jiyoon's age, but I couldn't find Jiyoon.</p>
<p>Soon, all the pillars of light disappeared.</p>
<p>The summoning was finally over.</p>
<p>The next moment, I stopped dead in my tracks, feeling a strange sense of heavy pressure. It was hard to breathe, and my head felt dizzy.</p>
<p>「Something is looking at us.」</p>
<p>I lifted my head with difficulty, as if defying gravity.</p>
<p>Since when.</p>
<p>Someone was floating in the ceiling of the theater.</p>
<p>【Let's see. You're all here at last.】</p>
<p>Wearing a white coat that resembled Kim Dokja's and his trademark sunglasses, he was talking to us.</p>
<p>【Welcome to 'Kim Dokja's Banquet'. Everyone.】</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja.</p>
<p>The one who summoned us to this world.</p>
