<hr/>
<p>Han Sooyoung asked with a dumbfounded expression.</p>
<p>"What? What does this mean? Why did he suddenly mention the probability?"</p>
<p>"He is arguing needlessly."</p>
<p>"Arguing? Why?"</p>
<p>Why? Was it because I rejected his offer? Dokgak floated in the sky and reported to the Bureau.</p>
<p>The probability judgement…</p>
<p>I didn't think it would be used in this way. I expected the dokkaebis of other big channels to start a fight but I didn't expect it to be like this.</p>
<p>Bihyung's face turned red and he was tearful as he looked between me and Dokgak. It looked like tears would burst out as soon as he was touched.</p>
<p>–W-What? What do I do now?</p>
<p>–Tell me honestly. Did he find out about our contract?</p>
<p>Bihyung shook his head.</p>
<p>–Did he notice you opening the Dokkaebi Bag?</p>
<p>–T-That can't be.</p>
<p>–Really?</p>
<p>–P-Probably…</p>
<p>–Well, don't panic yet. Even if that is the case, it isn't something that is worth asking for a 'probability conformity request'. In the first place, it isn't a violation of regulations.</p>
<p>It was true. There was no precedent in which an incarnation made a 'stream contract' or could use the 'dokkaebi bag', so it wasn't a direct violation of Star Stream's regulations.</p>
<p>Bihyung belatedly nodded with relief.</p>
<p>–Y-Yes. I understand.</p>
<p>Seeing this childlike Bihyung, I didn't know if he was the dokkaebi or if I was. I looked at Dokgak and the low-grade dokkaebis again.</p>
<p>[The #BI-7623 channel manipulation has been reported.]</p>
<p>[The Bureau is currently discussing this issue.]</p>
<p>If I was right, the probability request would eventually be cancelled. Although the story would be different if Dokgak had 'evidence' for this…</p>
<p>He was hiding information and I had no way to figure out what it was. Then there was only one way left.</p>
<p>"Hey, can you stop stalling and quickly give me my reward? Don't you see that the constellations are becoming bored?"</p>
<p>[That is a problem. This is more important than the compensation payout.]</p>
<p>–Have you changed your mind? If you agree with my proposal, I will get rid of all of this for you.</p>
<p>I looked up at Dokgak. Yes, let's try a frontal confrontation.</p>
<p>"What are your concerns? Let me look. How is the channel I belong to illegally manipulating the scenario? Is there any evidence?"</p>
<p>I would find out what his evidence was if he had it. If he was bluffing, the situation would end immediately.</p>
<p>Dokgak smiled like he had been waiting.</p>
<p>[Do you really want to hear it? You will regret it.]</p>
<p>"Tell me."</p>
<p>[This issue involves you, Kim Dokja.]</p>
<p>"…Me?"</p>
<p>At this moment, I had a thought.</p>
<p>Was it because I used future information from the text? But due to the filtering, this information shouldn't have spread to the constellations or the dokkaebis. Otherwise I would've already been caught in a probability storm…</p>
<p>[Do you see the screen?]</p>
<p>A huge screen appeared in the air. The screen showed videos of my recent battles. The first screen showed my conflict with Poisoner Lee Seolhwa.</p>
<p>[This is proof.]</p>
<p>"…What is the proof?"</p>
<p>The screen just showed that I didn't kill Lee Seolhwa. Dokgak changed the screen.</p>
<p>[This is also proof.]</p>
<p>The second screen showed me watching the battle between Lycaon and Antinus. What was this…</p>
<p>[This is the third proof.]</p>
<p>On the third screen, I was attacking the Disaster of Questions, Myung Ilsang. It was a scene where Myung Ilsang continuously released his seals. Suddenly, my stomach felt pained.</p>
<p>[What do these screens have in common?]</p>
<p>I realized it at this moment. This guy wasn't talking to me right now.</p>
<p>[Constellations looking at the screens, do you have any idea?]</p>
<p>Everyone in the area became quiet.</p>
<p>[The fight against the Poisoner, the fight against Antinus and the fight against the Disaster of Questions. There is one thing these three fights have in common.]</p>
<p>Then the screen kept changing.</p>
<p>[He actually had a chance to kill the Poisoner and stop the disaster.]</p>
<p>His finger pointed to the Poisoner.</p>
<p>[He could stop the disaster by killing Antinus.]</p>
<p>Then he pointed to Antinus.</p>
<p>[He could've stopped the Disaster of Questions before the seals were released.]</p>
<p>He pointed to Myung Ilsang then he pointed towards me.</p>
<p>[But he 'deliberately' didn't do it.]</p>
<p>"Wait! You are now…!"</p>
<p>Now I noticed what Dokgak was trying to do. Goosebumps covered my entire body.</p>
<p>I see. This was what the dokkaebi was planning.</p>
<p>[Constellations. Incarnation Kim Dokja colluded with the channel's streamer, 'Bihyung'. He deliberately concealed his strength and manipulated the development of the scenario. He made the scenarios harder for malicious purposes.]</p>
<p>Then the final screen appeared. It showed me using Way of the Wind to stop Myung Ilsang.</p>
<p>[He did this to 'direct' the last catharsis.]</p>
<p>This bastard, he didn't intend to ask for the 'probability conformity request' from the beginning.</p>
<p>Dokgak…</p>
<p>This was his real purpose.</p>
<p>[It is just to rip off coins from you.]</p>
<p>It was the end of Bihyung's channel.</p>
<p>[Some constellations are silent.]</p>
<p>The evidence that Dokgak exposed didn't violate the terms of the 'probability conformity judgment'. Dokkaebis controlling incarnations to make a scenario interesting wasn't uncommon.</p>
<p>The problem was the constellations who hated it. The moment they thought I wasn't serious about the scenario, the constellations would lose interest.</p>
<p>It was like alienating them from the play. The moment the fourth wall between the audience and the character collapsed, the audience would cool off straight away.</p>
<p>This was what Dokgak aimed for.</p>
<p>[The constellation Bald General of Justice's mouth is gaping open.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is chuckling.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' shrugs like it is fine.]</p>
<p>Some constellations were astonished, some constellations had no idea and some constellations were silent.</p>
<p>The problem was the other constellations.</p>
<p>[Some constellations have left the channel.]</p>
<p>[Constellations questioning the fairness of the channel has left the channel.]</p>
<p>[Some constellations are requesting coin refunds from the channel.]</p>
<p>The constellations left and Bihyung's channel started to shrink.</p>
<p>[The size of the channel is reduced.]</p>
<p>The messages continuously popped up. Bihyung's pale body was becoming smaller. His horns were shrinking.</p>
<p>I eventually sighed. "The channel is dead."</p>
<p>There was only one way left. I looked at the dwindling number of constellations and spoke to Dokgak.</p>
<p>"I understand so give me the compensation when you are done talking. I will accept your offer."</p>
<p>Dokgak's lips curved upwards.</p>
<p>–You are smart.</p>
<p>Bihyung's eyes grew wider with disbelief.</p>
<p>[Y-You…!]</p>
<p>"Don't look at me like that. It can't be helped." I shrugged while speaking in a loud voice.</p>
<p>Bihyung's lips trembled from the betrayal. This child was scared.</p>
<p>–Bihyung, do you trust me?</p>
<p>–What…</p>
<p>–Trust me this once. Aren't you already ruined?</p>
<p>I finished the communication and spoke to Dokgak.</p>
<p>"Start moving."</p>
<p>[Good. Then let's have a sweet rewards time.]</p>
<p>Dokgak flicked his fingers and the surrounding landscape disappeared. We reappeared in a room reminiscent of a luxury hotel suite.</p>
<p>…This was his 'official post'? I looked around a bit nervously. Low tables and chairs suitable for a dokkaebi were placed over luxurious rugs. There was a wide variety of alcohol on one side. Later I realized that it was a suitable setting for a dokkaebi who liked to drink.</p>
<p>I finished looking around and approached the window. The landscape outside was…</p>
<p>Oh my god. A darkness with no end filled my vision.</p>
<p>Glittering stars flowed in the darkness of the grand universe. It was a superb vision of the grand universe like endless jewels. The constellations repeated their orbits and rotations, each one part of the huge galaxy.</p>
<p>It was funny that at his moment, I was purely impressed. This was the Star Stream. It was the flow of the great stars that governed all scenarios. Every story began here.</p>
<p>"It is great." I looked back and saw Dokgak standing there. "Sometimes I just stare blankly at this landscape. I never get tired of this sight."</p>
<p>"You are now…"</p>
<p>"Ah, are you surprised? This is my 'real' voice."</p>
<p>It was the first time I heard the dokkaebi's voice. Previously it was always heard through a broadcast. In other words, the sight before me was Dokgak's real 'body'. Dokgak's eyes shone.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about?" I asked.</p>
<p>"What do you think? Ah, do you think I'll kill you?" He burst out laughing. "You know that is impossible."</p>
<p>"I'm not crazy enough to fight against a dokkaebi either."</p>
<p>"I like it. Then let's start the contract."</p>
<p>Dokgak flicked his fingers and a dokkaebi with a contract appeared before him. It was Bihyung. He was tied up by the system and stared at me with reproachful eyes.</p>
<p>"I brought Bihyung as a notary. In any case, you have to break the contract with him to form a contract with me. The cost of the destruction will be covered by Bihyung."</p>
<p>I was a bit surprised. This guy, he knew about my contract with Bihyung. It meant he knew from the beginning that I was a good person to attract the 'find an incarnation' group.</p>
<p>I pretended to be calm. "Do as you like. I don't care."</p>
<p>"It is good that the story is fast. Would you like to check the contract? It is also my first time making such a contract."</p>
<p>I read the contract. Needless to say, the contract was completely full of adverse conditions for me. Donations would be distributed 5:5. There were also some conditions that bound my freedom. Even now, I was the 'gap' instead of the 'eul'.</p>
<p>Dokgak laughed. "How about it? This is the industry average but I can make some adjustments."</p>
<p>It sounded like the industry average. Bihyung also tried a similar contract in the beginning.</p>
<p>I nodded and said, "Well, it isn't bad. But before I sign the contract, I have a suggestion."</p>
<p>"Suggestion? What is it?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it a shame if I'm the only one moving channels? Surely you won't be satisfied with just one thing? There are some strong constellations in my channel."</p>
<p>"Hoh? Who are they?"</p>
<p>"Prisoner of the Golden Headband, Abyssal Black Flame Dragon, Demon-like Judge of Fire…"</p>
<p>Dokgak looked surprise at each modifier.</p>
<p>"Prisoner of the Golden Headband? I didn't think you would have such constellations… Bihyung, you are quite good."</p>
<p>Bihyung hissed through his gag.</p>
<p>I continued speaking. This was the most important part.</p>
<p>"Honestly, I don't want to leave these constellations behind in this channel. Therefore, I want you to build a bridge so that the constellations can move channels with me."</p>
