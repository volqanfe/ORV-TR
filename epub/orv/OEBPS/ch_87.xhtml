<hr/>
<p>Returnee. This was the first statement that mentioned them in Ways of Survival:</p>
<p>「Some people go back in time, others go to another dimension and some are born again. In the end, the way to adapt to destruction varies from person to person. 」</p>
<p>The second 'method' of 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World'. To survive, destroy other dimensions and return.</p>
<p>"Answer me. Are you curious about my identity?"</p>
<p>Returnee Myung Ilsang. This boy was a returnee from Earth who was summoned to be a warrior in the world of Chronos.</p>
<p>"Hmm…isn't it normal to blush and lower your eyes in this situation? Noona is looking straight at me?"</p>
<p>The Disaster of Questions was such a bastard.</p>
<p>Yoo Sangah opened her mouth. "What…"</p>
<p>–Yoo Sangah-ssi, don't answer the question!</p>
<p>Yoo Sangah's head turned towards me at my words. However, her chin was caught by Myung Ilsang and forced her to look back.</p>
<p>"Where are you looking? Look at me. Is that your boyfriend?"</p>
<p>"Remove your hand."</p>
<p>Yoo Sangah shook off Myung Ilsang's hand. Her dagger moved in a threatening manner through the air. Myung Ilsang laughed.</p>
<p>[The second question has been resolved.]</p>
<p>[The second seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]</p>
<p>"Ah, that's right. I've had a baby-face for 100 years."</p>
<p>The boy's cold eyes turned towards me. I didn't use Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint but it was clear even without the skill.</p>
<p>"You were having fun in this peaceful world?"</p>
<p>His right arm aimed at me. At the same time, purple particles condensed around his hand.</p>
<p>[The character 'Myung Ilsang' has triggered 'Small Black Fire Cannon'!]</p>
<p>Black Fire Cannon. This was the fire of death that destroyed the eastern part of Chronos and burned all the insect kings in the forest.</p>
<p>The whole atmosphere was burning and I was surrounded by flames. Pain spread across my skin. I cursed inside my heart. Damn! It hurt. It really hurt. It hurt…</p>
<p>…Less than I thought?</p>
<p>After a while, the flames turned off and I looked at my skin. Every inch was scorched and painful, but it was a bearable pain.</p>
<p>This was the black fire cannon that drove the insect kings to fear? However, the Small Black Fire Cannon… it didn't hurt?</p>
<p>I looked up and saw Yoo Sangah wielding her dagger. Unexpectedly, she had the advantage. Even the Disaster of Questions was perplexed by the overwhelming attacks.</p>
<p>"…What? Why are you so strong? Is noona also a returnee? Or am I weak?"</p>
<p>I didn't understand. The original Disaster of Questions with two seals released should be stronger than this.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]</p>

</fieldset>
<p>I was nervous about the constant 'SSS' filling the screen but once I read it in detail, I understood why he was weak.</p>
<p>The dokkaebis were fair. Right now, he was weaker than the original disaster.</p>
<p>"Han Sooyoung! Yoo Sangah-ssi!" I didn't know if Bihyung was using his strength but now we had a chance. "Attack with all your strength! We must kill him now!"</p>
<p>If this was his current state, perhaps we could win without Way of the Wind. I poured my remaining coins into my stats.</p>
<p>[Physique Lv. 50 -&gt; Physique Lv. 60]</p>
<p>[Agility Lv. 50 -&gt; Agility Lv. 60]</p>
<p>[Magic Power Lv. 25 -&gt; Magic Power Lv. 60]</p>
<p>[39,500 coins have been consumed.]</p>
<p>[All stats have reached the scenario limit.]</p>
<p>I ran aggressively while activation Unbroken Faith.</p>
<p>"Remember! You should never answer his questions!"</p>
<p>Myung Ilsang seemed interested when he saw my Blade of Faith. "What? An energy sword?"</p>
<p>My attack missed by a hair's breath due to his high agility.</p>
<p>Myung Ilsang kept chattering. "Ahjussi, are you a martial artist? How can you use the energy sword already? Isn't this crazy?"</p>
<p>I ignored him and triggered a stigma.</p>
<p>[The stigma 'Song of the Sword' has been used.]</p>
<p>[Your sword is filled with the words left by the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare.]</p>
<p>A random verse of Duke of Loyalty and Warfare's story appeared in front of me, followed by a message.</p>
<p>「 The 28th day. Clear skies. I went to do official business. 」</p>
<p>Then nothing happened. Dammit, the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare didn't help me at this time.</p>
<p>The Nanjung Ilgi didn't always contain content that fought against the enemy. In fact, most of the contents were ordinary.</p>
<p>The sky was clear.</p>
<p>The Duke of Loyalty and Warfare went to do official business.</p>
<p>If I wrote a 'Destruction Diary', my diary would roughly be like this.</p>
<p>The sky was dark.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja was right.</p>
<p>I rolled across the ground to avoid Myung Ilsang's kick.</p>
<p>Myung Ilsang's expression gradually became serious. He carefully looked at my Blade of Faith and sighed with relief.</p>
<p>"Phew… that's right. It isn't a real energy blade. Ahjussi, why are you acting like it is real? You almost scared me?"</p>
<p>"Brat, you talk too much."</p>
<p>It was a cold female voice. While I was stalling for time, Han Sooyoung made dozens of avatars and they ran towards him.</p>
<p>"Die!"</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung's attacks poured onto the boy whose movements were blocked.</p>
<p>However, her attacks weren't strong enough to harm Myung Ilsang's body. Rather, Yoo Sangah was unable to do any damage due to the excessive number of avatars.</p>
<p>Myung Ilsang laughed as he was hit by Han Sooyoung's small hand.</p>
<p>"Aren't you also quite pretty? How old are you? A student?"</p>
<p>"Shut up, die!"</p>
<p>Myung Ilsang's face was marred by the continuous hits.</p>
<p>"…What is wrong with everyone? What did I do wrong? If you see a nice-looked returnee like me, shouldn't you welcome me with open arms? Should I get rid of all the monsters from now on?"</p>
<p>"What a mad dog!"</p>
<p>"Ah, were my words ridiculous? Wait a minute, perhaps you are…"</p>
<p>Myung Ilsang's expression changed.</p>
<p>"You guys are from the Hunters Association! Right? Isn't there normally this development? Aren't they always the first one to show up with a returnee comes back?"</p>
<p>"This chuuni bastard… no, shit?"</p>
<p>[The third question has been resolved.]</p>
<p>[The fourth question has been resolved.]</p>
<p>[The fifth question has been resolved.]</p>
<p>[The third seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]</p>
<p>Myung Ilsang smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>"You are from the Hunters Association."</p>
<p>It was really crazy. His momentum became even stronger. The surrounding avatars were destroyed by a powerful wave of energy emitted from Myung Ilsang's body.</p>
<p>Myung Ilsang burst out laughing. "Now, it is the munchkin's time!"</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung stepped back and glanced at me with an absurd expression. "What is with that bastard?"</p>
<p>I gasped with irritation. "Didn't I tell you not to answer him? You are just feeding that jerk."</p>
<p>"I didn't answer! I just swore."</p>
<p>"Just don't speak."</p>
<p>The point of the questions asked by the Disaster of Questions wasn't to get an answer. No matter what the answer, he would use it to strengthen his abilities.</p>
<p>Myung Ilsang kept speaking, "Then who should I kill first?"</p>
<p>But his words didn't last. It was because Yoo Sangah appeared behind him while emitting a fierce killing intent.</p>
<p>[Hermes Walking Method.]</p>
<p>[Theseus' Resolution.]</p>
<p>[Arachne's Web.]</p>
<p>The system messages didn't pop up but I was able to recognize these skills. In a future scenario called Ragnarok, these skills were clearly described. They were the stigmas of the Olympus related constellations.</p>
<p>The surprised Myung Ilsang unleashed a series of Small Black Fire Cannons to keep Yoo Sangah in check.</p>
<p>However, Yoo Sangah rushed towards Myung Ilsang without caring about the black fire cannons.</p>
<p>"Something like this…?"</p>
<p>It was impossible.</p>
<p>As long as they didn't experience a special scenario event, there was no way for an incarnation to simultaneously possess the stigmas of various constellations.</p>
<p>It was a situation where I only had two stigmas. Then how could Yoo Sangah have such a large number of stigmas?</p>
<p>"Let's try it! Does it hurts?"</p>
<p>Sweat covered Yoo Sangah's forehead.</p>
<p>The thread of magic power kept expanding and shrinking. She stepped freely through the air. The dagger pierced without hesitation whenever there was a visible gap. The vitality inside her body was burning.</p>
<p>It was an extraordinary change in just two days…</p>
<p>At this moment, I sensed something. The stigmas of various constellations in one incarnation.</p>
<p>There obviously wasn't a single case in Ways of Survival. It didn't even apply to Prophet Anna Croft of the United States. Then Yoo Sangah…</p>
<p>"Dokja-ssi! Now!"</p>
<p>Yoo Sangah gave the signal and I supported her explosive attack with the Blade of Faith. Han Sooyoung also participated. Little by little, Myung Ilsang became dizzy from all the hands and feet.</p>
<p>His movements were delayed for a moment and my Blade of Faith aimed at the gap, cutting his shoulder and belly.</p>
<p>"Shit…!"</p>
<p>Blood flowed out. Myung Ilsang pulled back and chanted something.</p>
<p>[The character 'Myung Ilsang' has used Blink Lv. 1.]</p>
<p>Myung Ilsang's figure became blurry. My mind was in a hurry. He couldn't get away.</p>
<p>I aimed the blade at his waist. But his body faded away just as the blade hit. The only thing left was scattered blood.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' lets out a sad sigh.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is going crazy from all the sweet potatoes¹.]</p>
<a href="#note1" epub:type="noteref">[NOTE 1]</a><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is pointing a finger at your heart.]</p>
<p>[The excitement of some constellations has reached a critical level.]</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung shouted, "Shit, we missed him!"</p>
<p>"It's okay. He is injured so we can catch him soon."</p>
<p>[Some constellations have calmed down.]</p>
<p>"Yoo Sangah. You did really well… Yoo Sangah-ssi?"</p>
<p>There was no answer from Yoo Sangah. I headed over because I sensed something strange, where she was standing there stunned. Han Sooyoung asked,</p>
<p>"What's wrong with her?"</p>
<p>I belatedly realized. Theseus' Resolution was a skill that drew out all the power of the incarnation. The use of that skill allowed Yoo Sangah to deal with a monster for a while.</p>
<p>I looked at her for a moment before handing her over to Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p>"Giving another person to me? Am I a daycare centre?"</p>
<p>"We need to find the disaster quickly. Shouldn't you scatter more avatars?"</p>
<p>"I think I roughly know where he went."</p>
<p>"Please guide me."</p>
<p>I couldn't miss that guy here. Han Sooyoung opened her mouth again, "I don't remember well… He becomes stronger every time he answers a question, right?"</p>
<p>"That's right. He is weak at first but becomes stronger every time he hears an answer. The returnees are too strong so there is a penalty when they fall into this world. Didn't you see the seals being released?"</p>
<p>"That boy… how many seals does he have?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps dozens. There will be no answer if he releases all of them."</p>
<p>So far, five seals were released.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the additional scenarios of the dokkaebis hadn't come down yet.</p>
<p>If an additional scenario was released, many people would try to hunt that bastard and his seals would be released in a flash due to the many idiots answering his questions.</p>
<p>…The moment I was feeling relieved.</p>
<p>[Hrmm. Everyone, aren't you great? Despite the penalty, this is still a disaster. Only three people putting pressure on him…]</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung and I looked up at the air at the same time.</p>
<p>[By the way, aren't you being too greedy? As the old saying goes, you should share the beans.]</p>
<p>"Shit."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung cursed while messages arrived like they had been waiting.</p>
<p>[A new sub scenario has arrived!]</p>
<p>[The sub-scenario – SSS-grade Hunt has begun!]</p>
<p>I grasped the handle of Unbroken Faith. The situation was reaching the limit.</p>
