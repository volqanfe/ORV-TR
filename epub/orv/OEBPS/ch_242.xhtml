<hr/>
<p>There were 10 constellations gathered here. I didn't know where the remaining four were but maybe they were scattered somewhere in the scenario area.</p>
<p>[If you don't yield…]</p>
<p>[I'll eat you too.]</p>
<p>The true voices of the constellations flowed from the mouths of the evil spirits. I didn't hesitate and infused magic power into the sword.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Purest Sword Force Lv. 8' has been activated.]</p>
<p>It was Iris' magic power instead of mine. Still, Iris was an incarnation who came all this way and her potential was considerable. The white energy was added to Eoren's Sword and the aura around it became more abundant.</p>
<p>Eoren's Sword was a weapon that could deal a powerful blow to evil spirits for 10 minutes. However, a powerful weapon didn't necessarily mean I would dominate this place.</p>
<p>A constellation saw my sword and laughed.</p>
<p>[Hahah, slow down! Small constellation. Please entertain these old people!]</p>
<p>[What old people? I haven't lived 500 years yet. There are those older than us.]</p>
<p>Was it because this was the first time I was attached to a young girl's body? My sword could only draw a clumsy trajectory through the air.</p>
<p>The constellations might not be able to use all their power but a constellation was a constellation. They ranged from historical-grade to lesser-grade.</p>
<p>The constellations who gathered to become evil spirits released their status. Iris' movements started to stiffen as the 10 constellations released their energy. Her body thrashed like she was caught in an invisible spider web. The spiders who trapped her were approaching.</p>
<p>I looked at Iris' body that was trembling regardless of my will and bit my lips. It was always like this but this time would be different.</p>
<p>[Don't look down on me. I am also a constellation.]</p>
<p>So far, I had never properly released my status. I had been fighting my way through the Demon Realm scenario in a sick state. However, I had been steadily recovering my stories while riding on the Gourmet Association's carriage. Thus, I might not be at a 100% state but I could use a 'status' that was almost equal to it.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'status' is released.]</p>
<p>Some of my stories started responding to the situation.</p>
<p>[The historical-grade story 'Gourmet Association Heretic' is rebelling against the surrounding oppression!]</p>
<p>[The legendary-grade story 'Demon King of Salvation' is responding to incarnation Iris' situation!]</p>
<p>The surrounding ground was split apart with a loud sound and the nearby forest shook. The constellations were astonished by the flood of sparks in the area.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the descended constellations could only use 10% of their power. On the other hand, I used 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' instead of 'advent' and was able to release my original status.</p>
<p>[How can a newcomer have this much status?]</p>
<p>[…Is this really the 'advent' state?]</p>
<p>The constellations didn't know this fact and were almost terrified. They were mistaking the current status as 10% of my original strength. It was the reason I was pushing myself in such an unreasonable manner.</p>
<p>[Either die or get lost. Choose one or the other.]</p>
<p>I had to get them right now before they stopped being fooled.</p>
<p>[C-Cheeky bastard…!]</p>
<p>[…The Star Stream is really wide. Where did a guy like this pop up from?]</p>
<p>Some of the constellations shrank back from the pressure I gave off while others were burning with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>[Ahahaha! The best dish. Today's Gourmet Association Festival is the best!]</p>
<p>The constellations emitted terrible shrieks and the arms of the evil spirits stretched towards this side. I hurriedly stepped back and swung my sword but couldn't cut off the incoming arms. Iris' voice was heard in my head.</p>
<p>'S-Sorry! I'm a terrible swordsman…!'</p>
<p>Shit. This was why my movements were like this. Blood splashed as Iris was wounded. Did they realize something from my movements? The momentum of the constellations was changing.</p>
<p>[…Something is strange?]</p>
<p>The constellations spread out and carried out sporadic attacks using the bodies of the evil spirits. I tried to defend by swinging the sword but it wasn't easy since Iris' swordsmanship skill level was too low.</p>
<p>The result was quite different from when I was in Yoo Joonghyuk's body. Once again, I realized how great Yoo Joonghyuk was.</p>
<p>[Indeed. only that guy's status is high. Get rid of him!]</p>
<p>[There is no need to worry about the sword. Hahaha, today we will eat!]</p>
<p>The worst situation that I wanted to somehow avoid was unfolding. The attacks of the evil spirits flew from everywhere. There was a small scythe that grazed my legs. A boomerang turned around and aimed at my back. A long spear pierced through a gap and struck my side. In less than a minute, Iris' body was covered with wounds and bruises.</p>
<p>My physical strength was rapidly dropping. I hurriedly opened Bookmark and Way of the Wind but it felt awkward in Iris' body. Eventually, my footsteps became twisted up and I was disoriented. The constellations aimed for this short gap and stretched out their arms towards me.</p>
<p>"Kuek…"</p>
<p>Iris was caught by the neck and hung helplessly in the air.</p>
<p>[You have bad luck, newcomer.]</p>
<p>The constellations acted like it was over as they opened their mouths.</p>
<p>[It is eating time.]</p>
<p>Grotesque fangs grew and digestive juices dripped from their mouths. Since they could customize the appearance of the evil spirits, it was really the worst taste.</p>
<p>I opened my mouth without hesitation. "I will activate the fifth bookmark."</p>
<p>In fact, I didn't want to use this skill here. I wasn't sure if Iris' body could endure it, nor did I want to consume an excessive amount of probability. Nevertheless, there was no other way.</p>
<p>[The fifth bookmark is activated.]</p>
<p>The moment that Bookmark was activated, an unexpected message arrived.</p>
<p>[The skill is not suitable for this person.]</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Miniaturization' is cancelled.]</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Electrification' is cancelled.]</p>
<p>The power of Bookmark disappeared with the sound of sparks. Sometimes a skill wasn't compatible with the chemistry of the body. But why did it have to happen now? I never expected this.</p>
<p>[Is this your last hurrah? Yes, give it a try.]</p>
<p>Along with the ridiculing voice, a long tongue slipped out from the mouth of the evil spirit and started to strangle Iris' throat. My prayers were blocked and I turned blue. I could feel Iris' consciousness blurring. The connection with Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint was weakening.</p>
<p>[The attribute effect has accelerated your thinking ability.]</p>
<p>Dozens of thoughts crossed my mind during this crisis until something was caught in the net.</p>
<p>…I didn't know if it was possible. My understanding of the character was still low. Still, I could try it.</p>
<p>"I will release Knight of Revolution Mark Javier from the sixth slot."</p>
<p>I released my 'status' as much as possible and instantly escaped from the capture of the constellation. Then I continued speaking. "I will place the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint Namgung Minyoung in that spot."</p>
<p>[The number six bookmark is activated.]</p>
<p>An immense presence permeated me. I felt all the things I've read, felt and experience become one and nestle in my body.</p>
<p>[Your understanding of this person is insufficient!]</p>
<p>It felt like the first time I loaded Kyrgios Rodgraim.</p>
<p>[W-What…?!]</p>
<p>[…What power is this?]</p>
<p>Astonishment filled the eyes of the Gourmet Association constellations.</p>
<p>[The level of the character is too high to fully reproduce the skill level.]</p>
<p>[The level of the character is too high so only a part of the skill is activated.]</p>
<p>[The duration of the bookmark is reduced due to a low understanding of the character.]</p>
<p>The original Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship was a skill that could only be used by women.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk overcame it with effort but it was unreasonable for me.</p>
<p>[Your current body configuration is similar to the physical makeup of the character in question.]</p>
<p>To be exact, it would've been impossible with my original body.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship' Lv. 10 (+1) has been activated.]</p>
<p>Thunder fell from the sky and nestled in Eoren's Sword. I released the maximum amount of power possible at the optimum time. Everything was over before the constellations even noticed the situation.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Breaking the Sky Thunder Sword' Lv. 10 (+1) has been activated.]</p>
<p>The blue thunder that could overturn the earth flew from the sky and struck everything in the area. The words of Ways of Survival passed through my head.</p>
<p>「 The Murim don't consider the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint as one of the 10 Grand Masters. 」</p>
<p>The bodies of the evil spirits scattered into ashes without even screaming.</p>
<p>「 The Murim people think of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint as a type of disaster. 」</p>
<p>Born as a small human and facing the constellations after hard work. This was the strength of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, a disaster of Murim.</p>
<p>[The skill has exceeded the talent of the incarnation body.]</p>
<p>I felt something twisting as blood flowed. The result was obvious. It was a force that Iris and I couldn't use because we weren't transcendents. The sky blinked like a power failure had occurred.</p>
<p>The dazzling thunderbolts disappeared and there were no evil spirits left in the surroundings.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Brash Swamp Predator' has been eliminated from the scenario.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Tranquil Island Gourmet' has been eliminated from the scenario.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Forgotten Lord of Envy' has been eliminated from the scenario.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[A total of 10 constellations have been eliminated from the scenario.]</p>
<p>[You have earned an unbelievable achievement!]</p>
<p>[A series of impossible feats have been accomplished in a row!]</p>
<p>I was barely breathing as I looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>[The Star Stream is paying attention to your achievements.]</p>
<p>[A new story for you is being prepared.]</p>
<p>The constellation's status might've been extremely limited but they still massacred the incarnations. Thus, there was no way I wouldn't get a story.</p>
<p>Blood emerged from my mouth while pouring simultaneously from my ears and nose. Blood poured out from many holes and I almost became used to the taste. Fortunately, the probability allowed by the Gourmet Association meant I could still endure.</p>
<p>I plastered Iris' broken body with fragments of the story. The shock from the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's technique had already caused Iris' consciousness to disappear.</p>
<p>[Constellations of the Gourmet Association are astonished by the contents of the scenario.]</p>
<p>[Some constellations of the Gourmet Association have become hostile to you.]</p>
<p>I knew I would be hated. However, there was always something to gain from losing something.</p>
<p>[Some constellations of the Gourmet Association are very curious about your story.]</p>
<p>[Some constellations of the Gourmet Association feel favourable towards you.]</p>
<p>I stumbled away with Iris' body and headed towards the volcano. Iris would survive once this scenario was completed. In order to complete the scenario, I had to throw the bracelet into the volcano lava.</p>
<p>There wasn't much distance remaining. 40 steps, 30 steps, 20 steps…</p>
<p>My face became hot as I neared the lava. The cliff that I could throw the bracelet was clear when I felt someone's presence. I expected them to appear now. There were still four evil spirits that I hadn't finished off.</p>
<p>[Demon King of Salvation, you are doing something really interesting.]</p>
<p>The familiar voice entered my ears as I tightly gripped Eoren's Sword. I looked back and a familiar looking girl stood there. She was an evil spirit but her basic appearance hadn't changed at all.</p>
<p>I opened my mouth. "Asmodeus."</p>
<p>Asmodeus was ecstatic, as if feeling pleasure that his name was called.</p>
<p>[…Ah, let me call you again.]</p>
<p>The person who damaged Yoo Joonghyuk's body and was the main culprit behind the third round failing.</p>
<p>I felt Asmodeus' status slowly approaching. This was the power of only 10%. As expected, one of the 72 demon kings was on a different dimension.</p>
<p>I took a step back and vigilantly watched my surroundings. It was still a difficult situation. Even if I removed this guy, there were still three more evil spirits remaining. My chances of winning were gone if they came. So before that…</p>
<p>[Don't be so vigilant. There are no other constellations.]</p>
<p>Three small heads were hanging from the small hands of the smiling Asmodeus. The black cloak billowed around the severed heads. They weren't the heads of incarnations.</p>
<p>A chill rose very slowly from the tip of my toes. In this brief moment, I understood why Asmodeus was described as a madman in Ways of Survival. There was a cold smile on Asmodeus' face that was smeared with the blood of constellations.</p>
<p>[I devoured all of them.]</p>
