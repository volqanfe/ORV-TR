<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">Ch 52: Ep. 11 – Night of the Prophets, III</h2>
<hr/>
<p>I was in a deep sleep. It was a long-awaited good night's sleep.</p>
<p>[The effect of the deep sleep has completely restored mental power.]</p>
<p>[Some of your exclusive skills have been updated.]</p>
<p>I checked my clock and saw that it was already 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Once Dongmyo Station and the surroundings areas were occupied last night, the accumulated fatigue settled firmly on me.</p>
<p>[Currently Occupied: Chungmuro (Main Base), Myeongdong, Dongdaemun History and Culture Park, Dongdaemun, Dongmyo, Sindang Station, Cheonggu Station, Yaksu Station, Sinseol-dong Station ]</p>
<p>Thanks to eating the Dongmyo Group, I now had nine stations. Now I just needed one more and the King's Road scenario would be over.</p>
<p>Just a bit more and I could achieve one of the key goals of the beginning scenarios, King of No Killing.</p>
<p>Once I came out, Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung were waiting for me.</p>
<p>"We are ready. When will we go?"</p>
<p>"Please wait a moment."</p>
<p>I looked towards the men who were heading towards me.</p>
<p>"Did you sleep well?"</p>
<p>Last night, I decided to have all members of Dongmyo join my group. The two men in front of me was the result of that decision.</p>
<p>Jung Minseob bowed to me and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"…Please keep me alive."</p>
<p>"Me too, me too. Sob!"</p>
<p>Originally I planned to kill Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob, but I changed my mind. These two were useful until I completely wiped out the prophets.</p>
<p>I put them in the Chungmuro Group and evolved the colour of the flag to 'brown'.</p>
<p>From the brown flag, it became possible to restrict the actions of the group members.</p>
<p>[You have exercised the right of the representative.]</p>
<p>[Group members Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob have restrictions on their behaviour.]</p>
<p>Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob's expression changed at the emerging system messages.</p>
<p>"One, from now on, you can't tell others about my identity."</p>
<p>"Yes, yep!"</p>
<p>"Two, you must unconditionally submit to my commands and you aren't allowed to act individually without my permission."</p>
<p>"…Of course."</p>
<p>[Group members Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob are willing to accept their limitations.]</p>
<p>[This restriction is a 'life' restriction.]</p>
<p>[If they break the restrictions, group members Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob will die.]</p>
<p>I nodded and said.</p>
<p>"Well… okay. I don't know when my heart will change, but everyone work hard. I will decide while watching you."</p>
<p>The two of them gulped and made hilarious faces. I didn't know what they were thinking. In any case, they wouldn't have been able to stick to Yoo Joonghyuk so it was better to stick to me.</p>
<p>"By the way, Representative-nim. What should we call you in the future…?"</p>
<p>"Call me like you are now. But call me Yoo Joonghyuk in front of the other prophets. Ah, Jung Minseob."</p>
<p>"Yep."</p>
<p>"Give me the Fugitive's Mask."</p>
<p>Jung Minseob was upset but eventually gave it to me. Anyway, I had to pretend to be Yoo Joonghyuk if I wanted to go to the Night of the Prophets. This 'mask' would be a preventive measure for a situation I didn't know.</p>
<p>After a moment, the muscles on my face moved in a bizarre manner as my appearance started changing. It felt a bit weird but I soon got used to it.</p>
<p>"Huh, this is the real appearance of Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p>"Very handsome… The revelation wasn't wrong."</p>
<p>These bastards…</p>
<p>I wanted to snap out but I closed my mouth. I didn't need to be angry over something like this.</p>
<p>That reminded me, it would be better to know the details of these guys just in case.</p>
<p>"Jung Minseob, what is your attribute…"</p>
<p>At this moment, a system message flashed in my head.</p>
<p>[The history of this person has been updated.]</p>
<p>…What?</p>
<p>I tried to use Character List once again as a test.</p>
<fieldset>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">[Character Summary]</h3>
<p>Name: Jung Minseob</p>
<p>Age: 25 years old.</p>
<p>Sponsor: Cursed Gladiator</p>
<p>Exclusive Attributes: Light Projection (Rare), 1089th Person to Get Off (General)</p>
<p>Exclusive Skills: Sword Training Lv. 2, Powerful Blow Lv. 2, Berserk Lv. 3, Memory Enhancement Lv. 5]…</p>
<p>Stigma: Repay Grudges Lv. 1</p>
<p>Overall Stats: Physique Lv. 18, Strength Lv. 16, Agility Lv. 12, Magic Power Lv. 10.</p>
<p>Overall Evaluation: An incarnation that possesses good comprehensive skills and attributes. His sponsor is a bit lacking but his ability as a warrior is considerable. He would've been one of the 12 apostles if he had been a bit more patient. He is very regretful.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>…What did it mean that the Character List was updated?</p>
<p>A person I wasn't able to see the attributes window of yesterday suddenly became a character.</p>
<p>He was a prophet. In other words, a character outside the novel. Why did he suddenly change into a character?</p>
<p>"Oh, my attribute is…"</p>
<p>"No need."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>I also confirmed the attributes of Lee Sungkook.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his attributes were the same. Hypnotist and 9th Person to Get Off… The latter was garbage but the former was a pretty good attribute.</p>
<p>"Give me your smartphone."</p>
<p>"Yep! Here it is."</p>
<p>I received a smartphone from one of them and connected to the chat room.</p>
<p>Ah… the Internet didn't work. Yesterday it was disconnected…</p>
<p>[The character 'Han Donghoon' used 'Wide-area Internet Lv. 5' on your smartphone.]</p>
<p>[The device's Internet is now available.]</p>
<p>As soon as I thought it, the Internet was connected. I glanced towards the tent where Han Donghoon was located. There was a vibration from the smartphone, indicating that a message had arrived.</p>
<p>–I'm going to believe in you just once.</p>
<p>Maybe something changed with Han Donghoon after what happened last night. I had been really worried about it so I was glad.</p>
<p>I sent a reply to Han Donghoon.</p>
<p>–Thank you.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, I would have a chance to talk to him. I once again opened Lee Sungkook's smartphone to the Prophets chat room.</p>
<p>[Chat Room]</p>
<p>[List of participants: No. 9, 15 I feel like Dying, 124 Let's Drop Off, No. 763, 887 Get Off, No. 645… a total of 36 people.]</p>
<p>I looked at the numbers in their names and got a sense of who they were. But something was strange.</p>
<p>"…36 people?"</p>
<p>Jung Minseob answered my question.</p>
<p>"All the prophets in the room stopped reading early. There are no apostles."</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>"By the way, Representative-nim. Didn't you say it yesterday? 'You should've read to the end'… then do you know all of the Book of Revelation?"</p>
<p>I looked at the expectant Jung Minseob and laughed.</p>
<p>I knew. Do you know?</p>
<p>"You won't regret taking my line instead of Yoo Joonghyuk's."</p>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
<p>After a while, we headed to Anguk Station while avoiding the surrounding conflict areas.</p>
<p>It was because the Night of the Prophets was scheduled to be held.</p>
<p>I spied on these guys through Lee Sungkook's smartphone.</p>
<p>—–</p>
<p>No. 519: Really? Yoo Joonghyuk is coming this evening?</p>
<p>No. 67: There is no doubt. No. 9 and No. 1089 said it yesterday.</p>
<p>887 Get Off: The 9th is a newcomer but I can believe it if it is the 1089th…</p>
<p>124 Let's Drop Off: This time they will all be behind us.</p>
<p>887 Get Off: No. 124, you are in Seoul ㅋㅋ How can those jerks fall behind you?</p>
<p>124 Let's Drop Off: Ah, except for me of course. Local residents, victory ^ ^ v</p>
<p>887 Get Off: I would like to be a regressor… If I had read the novel at that time… No, if I had only read up to 50… I'm jealous of those apostles scum…</p>
<p>15 I feel like Dying: But don't you think the people who read over 50 chapters are abnormal?? I don't know how they read to over 50. ㅋㅋㅋ</p>
<p>124 Let's Drop Off: Real psychos ㅋㅋㅋㅋ</p>
<p>—–</p>
<p>As expected, humans who hid behind anonymity would reveal the truth. Perhaps the number before the nickname was where they stopped reading.</p>
<p>—–</p>
<p>No. 888: But are you sure there is no txt version of this novel?</p>
<p>No. 124: A few days ago, I searched the Internet and there was really nothing left… Ahh… A novel without a txt… (tears)</p>
<p>No. 763: Even if you had a copy, you wouldn't share such a fraudulent thing. If I could really sell my soul, I would buy it.</p>
<p>—–</p>
<p>The idea of trying to read Ways of Survival popped up. These guys, they should've read it with me at that time.Now they didn't know the days ahead.</p>
<p>"We've arrived."</p>
<p>I was about to say, "What, already?" when I saw the platform of Anguk Station in front of me. The prophets who arrived in advance could also be seen.</p>
<p>But something was strange.</p>
<p>"Nobody has occupied this place?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is a promise between the prophets. It could be dangerous to meet at an occupied station. It is sort of like the DMZ."</p>
<p>Then a prophet approached and waved.</p>
<p>"Hey, No. 1089!"</p>
<p>"Oh, it is No. 763 hyung."</p>
<p>Jung Minseob waved and welcomed the person.</p>
<p>"How have you been? Your face doesn't look good?"</p>
<p>"Well spotted. The Tyrant King is giving me hell."</p>
<p>"I told you not to advance towards the Dobong side. Why didn't you listen…"</p>
<p>No. 763 glanced towards me and his face suddenly stiffened.</p>
<p>"P-Perhaps… he is…?"</p>
<p>Jung Minseob nodded.</p>
<p>No. 763's eyes showed astonishment.</p>
<p>"I-It is really an honour. Yoo Joonghyuk-nim!"</p>
<p>The uproar caused the scattered prophets to gather one by one.</p>
<p>"Is that…?"</p>
<p>The prophets ran together and pushed in front of me. There were also a few female prophets.</p>
<p>"He looks better than I imagined! I am No. 998!"</p>
<p>"It is great to meet you, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim! I'm No. 1055!"</p>
<p>This… I felt like a real king. Their shining eyes wanted to win my favour somehow. I wondered what they would all look like when they realized I wasn't really Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>Most of them weren't worth paying attention to. Their knowledge of the future was dim and their abilities were poor.</p>
<p>Yet there were some prominent people.</p>
<p>"It was very impressive when you fought against Demon King Asmodeus in the second regression."</p>
<p>Hoh?</p>
<p>"It was mentioned briefly in the Book of Revelations… now that I've met Yoo Joonghyuk-nim, I feel like hearing about it from you."</p>
<p>Ways of Survival started with Yoo Joonghyuk's 'third' regression and all the stories from the second regression were treated as recollections.</p>
<p>Yet this guy knew about Asmodeus? Why was he so impressed when he didn't read until the end?</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>"I am No. 1168."</p>
<p>Then he almost read to the 50th chapter. Perhaps he was the one who read the most out of those present.</p>
<p>No. 1168 asked me, "Excuse me, is it Yoo Joonghyuk-nim's third turn right now?"</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"Ah, as expected…"</p>
<p>Some prophets had dark expressions.</p>
<p>Yes, I knew.</p>
<p>Ways of Survival was an infinite loop so those who discovered that it was early on in Yoo Joonghyuk's regressions would be quite disappointed.</p>
<p>These jerks, they only got the cute side of Yoo Joonghyuk in the beginning… in any case, those who didn't read until the end weren't satisfied.</p>
<p>Then there was a disturbance behind me.</p>
<p>"Lee Hyunsung-nim!"</p>
<p>"Steel Sword Lee Hyunsung?"</p>
<p>Lee Hyunsung blushed as he was surrounded by people.</p>
<p>"W-What are you doing? I'm not the Steel… I'm not that!"</p>
<p>"Wow, just like a real revelation. Look at those biceps!"</p>
<p>"Ohhh! So taut!"</p>
<p>Lee Hyunsung had a good-looking face and was quite popular among the female prophets. At that time, one passing prophet showed interest in Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>"Excuse, perhaps… are you Maritime Admiral Lee Jihye?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then are you…"</p>
<p>"I am Jung Heewon. Why?"</p>
<p>"Ah, I see."</p>
<p>The disappointed prophet moved past Jung Heewon towards Lee Hyunsung. Jung Heewon looked at the situation and spoke to me in Group Chat.</p>
<p>–Why… isn't anyone interested in me?</p>
<p>–Heewon-ssi isn't famous in the future.</p>
<p>–Tsk.</p>
<p>–So do well from now on.</p>
<p>I turned away from the miserable Jung Heewon. I came to the Night of the Prophets for a reason. I couldn't waste time talking like this.</p>
<p>"Where is the weapon?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"The weapon you have hidden. I will check it first."</p>
<p>"Ah, here it is."</p>
<p>The 763th prophet excitedly moved to the centre of the platform and removed the cloth covering something. There was a big stone present.</p>
<p>I remembered the moment I saw the meteor shower on the roof of the theatre. No, wait a minute.</p>
<p>"Is that a meteorite?"</p>
<p>"Haha, that's right. At this point, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim might not know… according to the Book of Revelation, it contained a powerful weapon."</p>
<p>"A weapon?"</p>
<p>"Yes! That's correct. Maybe it is a weapon like a top ranking star relic."</p>
<p>"Doesn't the meteorite need hatching time and can't be used now?"</p>
<p>"Haha, we have a rotation that will provide magic power. It will hatch tonight at the latest. We have been working on it for a few days…"</p>
<p>I became colder as I looked at this proud bastard.</p>
<p>A red pattern. It was nonsense. This thing shouldn't be known until at least the fourth regression?</p>
<p>"Which bastard gave you the information?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"That person who brought the meteorite to you."</p>
<p>"Oh, that… No. 1124, he was the first one…"</p>
<p>No. 1124? A person who stopped reading early on knew this information?</p>
<p>"Where is he?"</p>
<p>Jung Minseob looked around the place and muttered.</p>
<p>"Uh… I guess he hasn't come yet."</p>
<p>The informant didn't come. I thought for a moment before opening my mouth.</p>
<p>"We have to get out of here."</p>
<p>It was a trap.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Right now."</p>
<p>This was the first time I got a cold sweat since Ways of Survival became a reality and since meeting Yoo Joonghyuk the first time.</p>
<p>This was a weapon? Who was stupid enough to think like this…</p>
<p>I glanced around at the prophets staring at me with naive eyes. Then the platform started vibrating.</p>
<p>Kukukung…!</p>
<p>I looked at the trembling 'meteorite' and stepped back. I had come here to sweep away the prophets, only to be the one swept away.</p>
<p>"W-What is this?"</p>
<p>Jung Minseob made a stupid noise.</p>
<p>Dammit. The fourth scenario hadn't even ended and the 'disaster' of the fifth scenario was about to appear.</p>
<p>I shouted toward Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung.</p>
<p>"Run away!"</p>
<p>This was why I couldn't trust those who didn't read to the end. Due to these damn people who got off early, today became all wrong.</p>
