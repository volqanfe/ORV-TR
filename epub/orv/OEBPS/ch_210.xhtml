<hr/>
<p>It was the first time I felt like this in my life. I felt so enormous that I focused on this feeling and forgot to say that I was Yoo Joonghyuk. It felt like dozens of metres of time and space were kneeling before me. This was what the constellations felt.</p>
<p>[Your incarnation body isn't suitable for expressing your status.]</p>
<p>I had adjusted the level but there was still a huge burden on my body. It wasn't even a proper release of my status in the first place.</p>
<p>[Your status is disagreeing with your incarnation body and will be temporarily adjusted.]</p>
<p>[Your current status is historical-grade.]</p>
<p>A narrative-grade status wasn't something my incarnation body could afford. Even the historical-grade constellations couldn't keep their dignity in the form of a symbol, let alone a ragged incarnation body. However, this was enough.</p>
<p>"Kuk, keok, keook…!"</p>
<p>The incarnations were letting out pained sounds. I saw this and quickly confined it to the radius of the marquises. The half-kneeling marquises had expressions like they lost their souls.</p>
<p>[Someone in the Demon Realm has detected your presence.]</p>
<p>[Someone in the Demon Realm has detected your presence.]</p>
<p>[Someone in the Demon Realm has detected your presence.]</p>
<p>It was just a short moment yet I already received three messages. They were probably the demon kings of the Demon Realm.</p>
<p>It didn't matter. I was going to let them know eventually. In addition, they couldn't tell who I was at this level.</p>
<p>[Your incarnation body can't afford your status!]</p>
<p>The stories making up my back started falling away. Fortunately, it was in a blind spot and the marquises hadn't noticed yet.</p>
<p>"T-This aura…"</p>
<p>"A constellation!"</p>
<p>Marquis Osteon belatedly regained his spirit and screamed. Cuarteto next to him was on the verge of retreating back. It was a spectacular sight but I couldn't waste time.</p>
<p>[Your incarnation body has started to collapse!]</p>
<p>I didn't have a lot of fighting power compared to my 'status'. Thus, I had to end it the moment the opponents died.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]</p>
<p>Then why? Sparks appeared in the air and the skill was forcibly terminated.</p>
<p>[Your incarnation body is too unstable to use that skill.]</p>
<p>…Son of a bitch. Was I too hasty?</p>
<p>[You have used a strength that doesn't meet the probability!]</p>
<p>[The exile penalty is accelerated.]</p>
<p>I had engaged in combat recently and expected this to happen. However, the collapse of my body was much faster than expected. It seemed that the burden of extracting a constellation's status was considerable.</p>
<p>The marquises started to adapt and pushed themselves against my pressure. They seemed to have one legendary story or many historical-grade stories. I guessed they were on the level of Reinheit of Paradise.</p>
<p>"Even if you are a constellation, you can't kill me in the scenario!"</p>
<p>In addition, they were smart. Marquis Osteon once again transformed into an executioner and aimed a scythe at me. It was a situation where the only fighter, Jang Hayoung couldn't move. Now I had no way to kill this guy. The situation started flowing in an even worse direction.</p>
<p>"An exile?"</p>
<p>"…Don't tell me?"</p>
<p>The story fragments falling from my body increased and the marquises finally noticed. I wasn't able to use Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint due to the skills restriction but I seemed to know what they were thinking.</p>
<p>「 If I could get that guy's story… 」</p>
<p>The hyenas hunting the injured predator started to carefully surround me.</p>
<p>"Call for reinforcements! We can destroy him if we drag out the time."</p>
<p>There was a whistle and executioners approached from every direction. I also felt unusual movements from the nobles on the Factory side.</p>
<p>「 Kim Dokja thought. 」</p>
<p>To kill a marquis, I must use at least Electrification.</p>
<p>「 But I can't use the skill. 」</p>
<p>If I wasted more time, my body and the citizens would be at risk.</p>
<p>「 I have to kill them using a method other than skills. 」</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>「 There was only one way. 」</p>
<p>The moment I made a decision, Marquis Osteon approaching me let out a terrible scream. "Kuaaack!"</p>
<p>Marquis Osteon's arm rolled along the ground. He was currently an executioner and shouldn't be hurt by normal attacks. It meant…</p>
<p>"You shouldn't be so careless."</p>
<p>Jang Hayoung stood behind him and laughed like a villain. It was an incredible recovery when considering what happened earlier.</p>
<p>[The character 'Jang Hayoung' has used the skill 'Immortal Body Lv. 7'.]</p>
<p>…Immortal Body? Wasn't this a healing skill from the Murim World? Jang Hayoung felt my gaze and muttered like he was giving an excuse. "One of the people I chatted to was from Murim…"</p>
<p>I watched the ashamed Jang Hayoung and sighed. He didn't talk with just the black dragon. By the way, Immortal Body was part of the Breaking the Sky Sword style…</p>
<p>"Hit them all! Kill the fighter first!"</p>
<p>Marquis Osteon removed the status of executioner and shouted at the surprised reinforcements. The remaining four executioners and the nobles who arrived started to surround us. I counted three earls and five barons. There was Baron Melen who I saw on my first day here.</p>
<p>"There! Save the revolutionary!"</p>
<p>The citizens ran to save us but the numbers were still lacking. Jang Hayoung turned pale as he watched the nobles who were taking out weapons.</p>
<p>"What should I do? I can't kill them."</p>
<p>A fighter was strong against the executioner but vulnerable to all other positions. In the end, I had to deal with the rest.</p>
<p>"Deal only with the executioners."</p>
<p>I blocked the nobles aiming for Jang Hayoung. Countless spears headed towards me but I didn't avoid them.</p>
<p>[You are currently under the protection of the scenario.]</p>
<p>I couldn't die under the protection of Guard. I could handle them one by one without overdoing it. As if reading my thoughts, a message appeared in the air.</p>
<p>[The 'ruler' has forcibly recalled the Night.]</p>
<p>The ruler. It was a position that referred to the duke, the master of this industrial complex.</p>
<p>[No one has died tonight.]</p>
<p>Night was over but the fight was still continuing. No, it was starting from now on.</p>
<p>[The power of the scenario that is protecting you has disappeared.]</p>
<p>"His protection has been released! Kill him!"</p>
<p>"He is a guy with amazing stories!"</p>
<p>The nobles rushed at me with anticipating and I smiled bitterly. "You slightly used your head but this was a mistake."</p>
<p>Night disappeared and the strength of the executioner couldn't be used. In addition, the marquises who were the core leadership of the industrial complex were here. I had been waiting for a long time.</p>
<p>"Open the story."</p>
<p>My body was unstable and I couldn't use skills. This didn't mean I had no way to fight.</p>
<p>[The historical-grade story 'Bug Slaughter' has been activated.]</p>
<p>It was impossible to open a story above legendary grade in my present state. However, I didn't need a legendary story to deal with these guys. This was a story that used the 'status' at the highest level. It was a story that the demon noble called Tentacio had once used in Dark Castle.</p>
<p>I slowly blinked and felt the nobles in front of me becoming smaller. The story Bug Slaughter was gained in exchange for killing tens of thousands of bugs. It was a terrible and vulnerable story when encountering a strong person but it was different when dealing with a weak person.</p>
<p>[You have absolute power over all beings with a lower status than you.]</p>
<p>[This story is only available to existences with a certain level of 'status'.]</p>
<p>A menacing air emerged from my body and the complexions of the approaching nobles turned blue.</p>
<p>"T-This is ridiculous…!"</p>
<p>It was already too late to feel regret. There was no need to use a sword. The muscles of my body instantly swelled and I started to beat the nobles with my fists.</p>
<p>"Kuaaack!"</p>
<p>It was literally a 'slaughter'.</p>
<p>[You have acquired a historical-grade story.]</p>
<p>[You have acquired a historical-grade story.]</p>
<p>The stories of the nobles entered my hands one by one.</p>
<p>[Your incarnation body is rapidly collapsing!]</p>
<p>I quickly opened a hole in the bodies of the barons and then pulled off the heads of the earls. The situation suddenly reversed and the remaining nobles started to run away.</p>
<p>"Run away! He isn't someone you can deal with! Quickly―!"</p>
<p>I missed some people but I didn't miss the important ones.</p>
<p>"Kuaaack!"</p>
<p>Cuarteto and Osteon struggled as I grabbed them by the neck. I didn't hesitate to hit their heads together and then pierced both heads with a hand.</p>
<p>"Kuheeeeok…"</p>
<p>The situation would've been different if it was a full-blown resistance. However, the marquises had been defeated by my 'status' and couldn't resist.</p>
<p>[You have obtained many new stories!]</p>
<p>[You have killed the Demon Marquis 'Cuarteto'.]</p>
<p>[You have killed the Demon Marquis 'Osteon'.]</p>
<p>[A new achievement has been acquired!]</p>
<p>[Your notoriety is spreading in the 73rd Demon Realm due to the killing of the marquises!]</p>
<p>[The high-ranking nobles of the Demon Realm will fear you.]</p>
<p>[50,000 coins have been acquired as compensation for the achievement.]</p>
<p>It was a small amount of compensation but it was better than nothing. I looked around and saw Jang Hayoung and the citizens organizing the remaining situation. The surviving executioners and nobles were retreating towards the Factory.</p>
<p>[Your incarnation body is reaching its limit.]</p>
<p>[The story 'Bug Slaughter' has been forcibly terminated.]</p>
<p>My vision momentarily shook and I became dizzy. I shouted towards the people fleeing towards the Factory. "Baron Gilat, Baron Sarabos and Earl Mokba!"</p>
<p>They were the names of the surviving executioners. It was the names of the executioners I got from Han Myungoh in advance. Now Jang Hayoung and I didn't have the energy to chase or engage with them.</p>
<p>Thus, I called out their names. It was a type of warning. I knew all their identities. I knew who they were and their positions. Therefore, they could die at any time.</p>
<p>The executioners trembled as they were threatened for the first time in their lives. I shouted towards them, "Tell this to the duke."</p>
<p>The light of dawn started shining like a lot of time had passed. In the dim and pervasive shadows, I slowly concluded my words.</p>
<p>"Learn to fear the day."</p>
<p>I was going to collapse at any moment but I didn't lose consciousness until the remnants of the nobles disappeared into the Factory.</p>
<p>Someone muttered, "R-Revolution…"</p>
<p>People started to call out for a revolution. I listened to these voices and recalled my favourite sentence from the 'revolutionary' arc.</p>
<p>「 In the light of dawn, the stopped time of the industrial complex started flowing again. 」</p>
<p>The anger and screams of those who had been sleeping for a long time in the Night. They were asleep for a long time and now feelings they didn't know existed were waking up.</p>
<p>"Revolutionary! Revolutionary!"</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk! Yoo Joonghyuk!"</p>
<p>[Your influence has transcended the influence of the real revolutionary.]</p>
<p>[The acquisition conditions have been satisfied and a new story is created.]</p>
<p>[The new story 'Silver Screen Revolutionary' has begun!]</p>
<p>Bihyung and the constellations should've seen this sight. It was a waste. I would've received a lot of coins. Then the message arrived like it had been waiting.</p>
<p>[The 'Dokkaebi Egg' has responded to your story.]</p>
<p>[The 'Dokkaebi Egg' has started to record your story.]</p>
<p>The vibrations of the egg became stronger and I heard another message.</p>
<p>[The egg's hatching is imminent.]</p>
<p>I knew that the time had come when I had the sound of cracking. Indeed, there was no need for other dokkaebis at this stage. It was because a dokkaebi had been present in this stage from the beginning.</p>
<p>[A temporary channel will be created in the Demon Realm.]</p>
<p>The Demon Realm's scenario would start from now on.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' has entered the temporary channel.]</p>
