<hr/>
<p>[I'm sorry but that's a bit difficult.]</p>
<p>I thought it was time for this guy to come out. It was the fucking intermediate dokkaebi. This guy managed the entire Seoul scenario and couldn't help moving at this time.</p>
<p>However, I was a bit confident. "Why is it difficult? We aren't breaking the scenario's rules."</p>
<p>[Spare the disaster? Are you insane? You must want to die.]</p>
<p>"No, it is the opposite. I am doing this to live."</p>
<p>The voice of the intermediate dokkaebi became harder.</p>
<p>[Don't you know that this is a violation of the rules? The content of the scenario is to kill the disaster. If you don't stick to the scenario…]</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I will kill the disaster." Everyone looked at me the moment I said these words.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi, what are you…?" In particular, Lee Jihye looked at me like I was a psychopath.</p>
<p>It wasn't strange. I previously said I wouldn't kill the disaster and now I said I would. Most of the party members were waiting for my next words. I felt a bit flattered by the trusting silence.</p>
<p>"Just not right now."</p>
<p>[What?]</p>
<p>"The scenario doesn't indicate a time limit. Then it is up to us when we want to kill the disaster." The intermediate dokkaebi looked like he had eaten Chinese medicine. "Thus, there is no need to rush."</p>
<p>The disaster Shin Yoosung looked up at me with a bemused expression. She hadn't known that such a thing was possible.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is looking at you with strange eyes.]</p>
<p>The agitation of the constellations could be felt. There weren't many episodes that rebelled against the scenario, even when I searched all of Ways of Survival. That's why it was of great interest to the constellations.</p>
<p>This was particularly true in situations where the distinction between good and evil was ambiguous. The number of subscribers from the absolute good or absolute evil constellations would rise in an overwhelming manner. It was their daily routine to discern the good and evil of the characters.</p>
<p>[I can't allow it.]</p>
<p>"Are you going to interfere in another scenario? Have you forgotten what happened last time?"</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>My confidence came from the fact that this was a main scenario, not a sub-scenario.</p>
<p>It was also the fifth scenario that was scaled to engulf all of the dome, making it difficult for the intermediate dokkaebi to change the criteria of the scenario. In addition, the intermediate dokkaebi had already received disciplinary action from the bureau.</p>
<p>He must be afraid of being punished again and didn't have much chance of winning this fight against me.</p>
<p>I saw Bihyung biting his nails nearby and told him, 'Be prepared. If something happens, you are the only one I can believe in'.</p>
<p>–Dammit, why should I?</p>
<p>'Don't forget that we will die together'.</p>
<p>Bihyung settled down and the intermediate dokkaebi opened his mouth.</p>
<p>[Very interesting. But it won't turn out as you think.]</p>
<p>Yes, I knew he wouldn't give up easily.</p>
<p>[Not all incarnation in Seoul Dome are the same as you.]</p>
<p>The intermediate dokkaebi flicked his finger. Then system messages popped up.</p>
<p>[A new sub-scenario has arrived!]</p>
<p>I knew what he was thinking. If he couldn't touch the main scenario then he would set up the sub-scenario.</p>
<p>[From now on, I will double the bounty on the disaster.]</p>
<p>The original compensation was 100,000 coins and it was doubled, which meant 200,000 coins. It was an amount that could make someone rise to the top of Seoul Dome in an instant. It was enough to risk their lives…</p>
<p>For some reason, no incarnations came running.</p>
<p>"Don't move."</p>
<p>"Cherish your lives. If you don't want to die like moths!"</p>
<p>The powerful kings were controlling the incarnations. They were King of Beauty Min Jiwon and Maitreya King Cha Sangkyung. There was also the Neutral King, Jeon Ildo.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is proud of the incarnations on the Korean Peninsula.]</p>
<p>Of course, there were forces that the kings couldn't control but they also didn't act. They had already seen the power of the disaster. It was natural that a small number of people wouldn't act, regardless of whether the reward was 100,000 or 200,000 coins. There was also our party covering the disaster Shin Yoosung…</p>
<p>[…How disappointing. The incarnations of Seoul Dome are cowards.]</p>
<p>There was an ominous feeling in the air. The intermediate dokkaebi was thinking about how to make this situation worse. I had to act quickly. At this point, I had to go for victory.</p>
<p>"Do you yield? Honestly, won't everyone be satisfied?"</p>
<p>[Everyone will be satisfied?]</p>
<p>I didn't say anything else. I'm sure the intermediate dokkaebi understood without me saying anything.</p>
<p>[Haha, I see. Is that what you were thinking? I heard from Dokgak but you truly put on a great show.]</p>
<p>The reason for the existence of the dokkaebis was the scenarios. They were the scenarios that many constellations responded to and many constellations liked.</p>
<p>In the world of the Star Stream, there was only one case where there was a miracle that reversed the scenario. It was if the majority of constellations saw the scenario and wanted to change the direction of the scenario.</p>
<p>[…Certainly, violence isn't the only stimulus.]</p>
<p>I tried to appeal to the constellations with disaster Shin Yoosung's situation. I chose words to avoid the filtering and continued to ignite the constellations by exposing information. I made them sympathize with the disaster Shin Yoosung.</p>
<p>It was all to support my rebellion. As a result, this whole situation was created. Indeed, I could hear the messages of the constellations in my ears.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' respects your will.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Last Hero of Hwangsanbeol' admires your will.]</p>
<p>Everything was going as planned.</p>
<p>"If you understand then can you decide now? Give me the reward or continue with the fifth scenario."</p>
<p>There was no problem with continuing the sixth scenario even if the fifth scenario hadn't ended. It was possible to run multiple main scenarios. If the dokkaebi was smart then he should stop while the constellations were satisfied.</p>
<p>[Incarnation Kim Dokja. You are the smartest and scariest out of all the incarnations I know.]</p>
<p>I felt a strange sense of incongruity from the dokkaebi's expression.</p>
<p>[However, it is this cleverness that is grabbing at your ankles.]</p>
<p>"…What does that mean?"</p>
<p>The dokkaebi's following words weren't for me.</p>
<p>[Okay Constellations. Now I will show you the story you have been waiting for.]</p>
<p>Sparks filled the air. The intermediate dokkaebi was moving the scenario.</p>
<p>[The intermediate dokkaebi has intervened in the scenario.]</p>
<p>[According to the scenario contract, control of the 'Disaster of Floods Shin Yoosung' has been transferred to the intermediate dokkaebi.]</p>
<p>Shin Yoosung's expression started to change at the system messages.</p>
<p>"N-No. Wait. I… aaaack!"</p>
<p>A black aura rose from disaster Shin Yoosung's body. I hurriedly shouted, "Wait! What are you doing?"</p>
<p>[I am fulfilling the contract. This is a cog in the scenario.]</p>
<p>I only realized now what he was trying to do. It was the scenario enforcement right. It was the power to control the fate of all 'parts' involved in the scenario. I knew it existed in Ways of Survival but I didn't think it would be used immediately.</p>
<p>[The personality of the character is forcibly changed.]</p>
<p>[The personality of the character 'Shin Yoosung' will be fixed to 'evil'.]</p>
<p>The disaster Shin Yoosung was becoming a monster. I bit my lip. The scenario enforcement generally wasn't used because the dokkaebi consumed a lot of probability. But to use it now…</p>
<p>[Many constellations are cheering the development of the scenario.]</p>
<p>[Many constellations hate your new drama.]</p>
<p>It could only be used if many constellations agreed to this development. Dammit, why?</p>
<p>"Dokja-ssi?"</p>
<p>"Hyung!"</p>
<p>The party members nervously approached my side. They realized that something was wrong. However, I couldn't understand. Why had the constellations suddenly turned their backs on me?</p>
<p>Bihyung's expression was dark as he looked at the sky.</p>
<p>–Sorry, I tried to persuade them but it didn't work.</p>
<p>'Why…'</p>
<p>–Your reputation is worse than you expected.</p>
<p>The intermediate dokkaebi said,</p>
<p>[Arrogant incarnation. Do you think the constellation would be that easy?]</p>
<p>…Then what about all the favourable indirect messages?</p>
<p>[Well, humans originally have the habit of believing what they want to believe.]</p>
<p>I had misjudged due to the indirect messages that popped up one after another.</p>
<p>[Many constellations are laughing at your decision.]</p>
<p>[Some constellations have withdrawn their support for you.]</p>
<p>That's right. Not all constellations sent indirect messages. Only a small number of constellations sent messages.</p>
<p>[Many constellations are wary of your intentions.]</p>
<p>It might be natural that public opinion was bad towards me. I cheated them through a trick and canceled the event. The constellations probably already knew that Bihyung's channel had a capacity of 9,999. They knew but had been deceived by my scenario. Now they were no longer fooled.</p>
<p>[Constellations of the Korean Peninsula are looking at you sadly.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking at you with compassion.]</p>
<p>Maybe I was too shallow when I thought about the constellations.</p>
<p>[It seems like your luck ends here, Incarnation Kim Dokja.]</p>
<p>"Ahhhhh!"</p>
<p>A disturbing aura flowed from the body of Shin Yoosung who had been forced to become evil. It was a killing intent that felt like it could melt flesh. The incarnations screamed and fled. I could see Yoo Joonghyuk pulling out Splitting the Sky Sword in the distance.</p>
<p>[I hope you put on a good show till the end.]</p>
<p>I slowly withdrew from the disaster. Shin Yoosung's face distorted sadly. It ended up like this. I quickly glanced at Yoo Joonghyuk. Things had turned out this way and it was obvious what choice he would make.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute, Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p>"You have failed."</p>
<p>"Don't touch the child." I hid the young Shin Yoosung behind my back. "I won't forgive you if you touch this child."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me. "There is no other way."</p>
<p>A way… I bit my lips until they bled.</p>
<p>"There is a way. We need to show the constellations their favourite scenario."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Defeat the disaster."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's expression hardened. "It is suicide Kim Dokja. Are you going to be a pushover?"</p>
<p>I saw Shin Yoosung turning into a demon and destroying everything around her. I didn't want it to be like this. This wasn't the ending I wanted. This damn world, even resisting a scenario became another scenario.</p>
<p>[Many constellations are excited by your words.]</p>
<p>[Many of the constellations want an exhilarating melee.]</p>
<p>Yes, they wanted to see this.</p>
<p>"Support me Yoo Joonghyuk. I will stop the disaster."</p>
<p>I had to give it a try.</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja, you…"</p>
<p>"I can do it."</p>
<p>I blinked slowly and the option I had postponed emerged in front of me.</p>
<p>[You have experienced the first person supporting role viewpoint.]</p>
<p>[You can take one of the supporting role's skills.]</p>
<p>[Presenting the list of available skills.]</p>
<p>[Please select a skill to acquire.]</p>
<p>I opened the list and picked an option without hesitation.</p>
<p>"No. 3, Beast King's Sensitivity."</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Beast King's Sensitivity' has been acquired!]</p>
<p>As if waiting, an ether storm emerged from disaster Shin Yoosung's hands. It was the ether storm that made a hole in my belly and made Yoo Joonghyuk incapable of fighting.</p>
<p>I protected my party members and received the storm head on.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Beast King's Sensitivity Lv. 3' has been activated.]</p>
<p>A pure white fur cloak. It was a unique skill of Beast Lord Shin Yoosung. More than half of my magic power was consumed activating it and I became dizzy, but I succeeded in receiving the attack of Shin Yoosung. The dignity of Beast King's Sensitivity didn't lose to the mighty storm.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk frowned. "You stole her skill but it is still impossible."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>I looked at disaster Shin Yoosung. Despite her nature being set to evil and losing control of her body, her eyes were filled with emotions. She told him.</p>
<p>「 …It's okay. Kill me. 」</p>
<p>Who could swing a sword after seeing those eyes? The woman who wandered for over a thousand years and suffered. I had to kill her now.</p>
<p>This was the price I paid for failing to change the story… For the first time, I felt resentful that Ways of Survival had become reality.</p>
<p>"Open your eyes and watch carefully." I looked up at the sky and declared. "This is the scenario you wanted."</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' can now be activated.]</p>
<p>Now that Shin Yoosung was in her final phase, it was an unwinnable fight. In the end, it was a fight that no one could win.</p>
<p>['Character Bookmarks' is activated.]</p>
<p>[Available Bookmark Slots: 4]</p>
<p>[Bringing up the list of available bookmarks.]</p>
<p>"I will release Delusion Demon Kim Namwoon from the 1st slot and add Judge of Destruction Jung Heewon."</p>
